Compound 2 reacts with aniline to form a new open-cage derivative with a 14-membered orifice, which yields an 18-membered open-cage fullerene derivative upon addition of another molecule of aniline. Two different types of aniline derivatives with either electron-donating or electron-withdrawing substituents can be added sequentially, affording an unsymmetrical moiety in the open-cage structure. Reduction potentials of the 18-membered open-cage fullerene derivatives can be fine-tuned by changing the substituents on the aniline.

The results provide new insights about the mechanism of open-cage reactions of fullerene-mixed peroxide.</dc:description><dc:description>\\nChemistry, Organic</dc:description><dc:description>\\nSCI(E)</dc:description><dc:description>\\nEI</dc:description><dc:description>\\n10</dc:description><dc:description>\\nARTICLE</dc:description><dc:description>\\n24</dc:description><dc:description>\\n10148-10153</dc:description><dc:description>\\n76</dc:description><dc:date>\\n2015-11-12T02:03:21Z</dc:date><dc:date>\\n2015-11-12T02:03:21Z</dc:date><dc:date>\\n2011</dc:date><dc:type>\\nJournal</dc:type><dc:identifier>\\nJOURNAL OF ORGANIC CHEMISTRY.2011,76,(24),10148-10153.</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>\\n895142</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>\\n0022-3263</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>\\nhttp://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11897/236880</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>\\n10.1021/jo202014q</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>\\nWOS:000297715900027</dc:identifier><dc:language>\\nen</dc:language><dc:publisher>\\njournal of organic chemistry</dc:publisher><dc:source>\\nSCI</dc:source><dc:source>\\nEI</dc:source>\\n</oai_dc:dc>\\n</metadata></record>',\n",

       "    'description': 'The first study to exploit the sedimentary archives of Loch Sunart, a relatively well-flushed fjord on the NW coast of Scotland, for palaeoenvironmental reconstruction is presented. In order to understand environmental influences on past environments, the\\r\\nmodern physical, chemical and biological conditions of the loch and surrounding\\r\\ncatchment were studied. Both observational and computer modelled annual inner basin\\r\\nsalinity show a clear response to climatic forcing, modulated by NAO behaviour. Main\\r\\nbasin salinity appears to remain very stable and a well-defined salinity: δ¹⁸O relationship\\r\\nsuggests excellent potential for palaeotemperature reconstructions based on foraminiferal δ¹⁸O\\r\\n.\\r\\nMulti-variate statistical analyses identified 4 benthic foraminiferal assemblage groups in\\r\\nthe surface sediments of the loch: A) restricted basin (E. scaber); B) very high current\\r\\nactivity (C. lobatulus-A. mammilla -A. beccarii); C) calm environment undera stratified\\r\\nwater column (B. marginata-N. turgida-S. fusiformis) and D) coastal water influence and\\r\\nmild/episodic current activity (A. beccarii-C. lobatulus-S. wrightii-E. excavatum). Using\\r\\nassemblage data, an existing benthic foraminiferal transfer function was modified in\\r\\norder to reconstruct Loch Sunart bottom water temperature (BWS); these reconstructions\\r\\nagree well with Scottish coastal temperature series (Millport).\\r\\n\\r\\nC. lobatulus appears to calcify close to theoretical equilibrium δ¹⁸O calcite (Δδ¹⁸O = -0.11 ± 0.17 %), probably during the warm bottom water temperatures (BWT) of late\\r\\nautumn, and predominantly reflects changes in BWT rather than BWS in the main basin\\r\\nof Loch Sunart.\\r\\nThe first late Holocene high resolution palaeoenvironmental reconstruction from the deep\\r\\n(121 m) main basin of Loch Sunart is presented; gravity core (GC023) is 3 m long and\\r\\nspans the last 2,000 years.

In order to understand environmental influences on past environments, the\\nmodern physical, chemical and biological conditions of the loch and surrounding\\ncatchment were studied. Both observational and computer modelled annual inner basin\\nsalinity show a clear response to climatic forcing, modulated by NAO behaviour. Main\\nbasin salinity appears to remain very stable and a well-defined salinity:b180 relationship\\nsuggests excellent potential for palaeotemperature reconstructions based on foraminiferal\\n5180.\\nMulti-variate statistical analyses identified 4 benthic foraminiferal assemblage groups in\\nthe surface sediments of the loch: A) restricted basin (E. scaber)\\\\ B) very high current\\nactivity (C. lobatulus-A. mammilla -A. beccarii); C) calm environment under a stratified\\nwater column (B. marginata-N. turgida-S. fusiformis) and D) coastal water influence and\\nmild/episodic current activity (A. beccarii-C. lobatulus-S. wrightii-E. excavatum). Using\\nassemblage data, an existing benthic foraminiferal transfer function was modified in\\norder to reconstruct Loch Sunart bottom water temperature (BWS); these reconstructions\\nagree well with Scottish coastal temperature series (Millport).\\nC. lobatulus appears to calcify close to theoretical equilibrium S180 calcite (A5180 = -\\n0.11 ±0.17 %c), probably during the warm bottom water temperatures (BWT) of late\\nautumn, and predominantly reflects changes in BWT rather than BWS in the main basin\\nof Loch Sunart.\\nThe first late Holocene high resolution palaeoenvironmental reconstruction from the deep\\n(121 m) main basin of Loch Sunart is presented; gravity core (GC023) is 3 m long and\\nspans the last 2,000 years. Despite difficulties with geochronology, palaeoenvironmental\\nreconstructions from Loch Sunart suggest that these high resolution sedimentary archives\\nhave the potential to resolve inter-annual marine climate variability of the order of 1-2°C\\nand capture an integrated record of changes in the catchment and marine environment.\\nii\\nAcknowledgments\\nFirstly I would like to thank my supervisor, Dr. Bill Austin, for providing me with the\\nopportunity to pursue this Ph.D. and for his help, support, funding, expertise and\\nguidance throughout.\\nMany thanks to Dr. P.

Project rationale\\nOceans play an important role in the regulation of global climate (Clark et al., 2002),\\nparticularly the sub-polar/polar North Atlantic Ocean, where the formation of deep\\nwater is the primary driver of the thermohaline circulation (Broecker et al., 1990).\\nPalaeoclimatic studies utilising marine, terrestrial and ice core archives have therefore\\nbeen carried out in the North Atlantic because this region provides a globally\\nsignificant perspective of the magnitude and rate of climate change (e.g. Cortijo et al.,\\n2000).\\nWithin a palaeoceanographic context, the majority of studies have employed deep sea\\nsediment cores to provide an insight into ocean circulation dynamics and global\\nclimate change over recent geological time, particularly across the glacial-interglacial\\ntransitions of the current Quaternary period (e.g. Bond et al., 1992; Seidenkrantz et\\nal., 1995; Austin & Evans, 2000). Seminal work within the last 2 decades noted the\\npresence of millennial-scale climate cycles pervading late Quaternary marine archives\\nand high resolution ice core records in a penecontemporaneous fashion (Bond et al.,\\n1999). This millennial-scale variability is often attributed to changes in the global\\nthermohaline circulation (THC), however the recent identification of centennial and\\ndecadal-scale variability in palaeoclimatic records (e.g. Hall et al., 2004; Andresen et\\nal., 2005) suggests factors other than the rate and location of deep ocean ventilation,\\nsuch as solar variability or an Atlantic multi-decadal oscillation (Kerr, 2000), are\\nplaying an important role in driving long-term climate change. In addition, deep\\nocean environments typically have low sediment accumulation rates (<0.01 cm yr\"1)\\nwhich are often affected by bioturbation, thus creating the need for high resolution\\nmarine sedimentary archives in order to investigate the Atlantic\\'s multi-decadal\\nclimate oscillations.\\nHigh sediment accumulation rates (~ 0.5 cm yr\"1) in sea loch (or fjord) environments\\nprovide the potential for high resolution palaeoenvironmental studies and present a\\nunique opportunity to study land-ocean interactions. Palaeoenvironmental studies\\nfrom W Norwegian fjords, for example, have demonstrated that sediments and benthic\\n1\\nChapter I Introduction\\nforaminifera from these environments capture and record centennial and decadal\\nvariability in the coastal environment and climate of western Norway (e.g. Mikalsen et\\nai, 2001; Kristensen et al., 2004). Climatically driven circulation changes linking\\nScottish coastal regions to the North Atlantic have been illustrated by Holliday (2003).\\nAt a regional scale, recent work by Gillibrand et al., (2005) and Austin & Inall (2002)\\nexemplify the potential for regional changes in fjordic hydrography to be captured in\\nthe carbonate shells of marine organisms. Since the west coast of Scotland lies in a\\nclimatically sensitive region of the North Atlantic it is also likely that Scottish sea loch\\nsediments capture North Atlantic climatic variability, possibly with sub-decadal\\nresolution.\\nDespite this potential, few palaeoenvironmental studies have been carried out in\\nScottish sea lochs. Those that exist have focused upon the last glacial - interglacial\\ntransition (LGIT; Dix & Duck, 2000; Howe et al., 2002) or cover only the past few\\ncenturies (Murray et al., 2003). Thus, the sea lochs (fjords) of NW Scotland have\\nbeen generally overlooked in terms of palaeoenvironmental work and neglected in the\\ncontext of late-Holocene climatic variability.\\n1.2 The role of oceans in modulating global climate\\nWhilst the orbital forcing of the Earth\\'s climate primarily drives the large glacial-\\ninterglacial cycles (Lowe & Walker, 1997), the oceans play an important role in the\\nmodulation of climate variability. This is due to the strong ocean-atmospheric\\ncoupling and subsequent transfer of both sensible and latent heat (Cayan, 1992; Bigg,\\n1996) and latitudinal heat transfer from the tropics poleward (Ganachaud & Wunsch,\\n2000). The majority of the ocean\\'s energy comes from solar radiation heating of the\\nsurface layer (Bigg, 1996) and the high specific heat capacity of the ocean influences\\natmospheric climate on daily, seasonal and inter-annual time scales (Clark et al.,\\n2002). Additionally, the ocean can retain a \\'memory\\' of atmospheric climate (see\\nsection 1.3.1).\\n2\\nChapter 1 Introduction\\n1.2.1 Tliermohaline circulation\\nGlobal thermohaline circulation (THC) and it\\'s role as a conveyor of heat around the\\nglobe is well documented (see Rahmstorf, 2002 and references within). Warm saline\\nwater flows from the tropical Atlantic region towards the high latitudes, in particular\\nthe North Atlantic, due to differential solar heating of the surface ocean at high and\\nlow latitudes (Bond et al., 1999; Clark et al., 2002). At around 60 °N, surface water is\\ncooled, subsequently causing an increase in surface water density. The formation of\\nsea ice can also result in brine formation, providing an additional mechanism that\\ncreates dense water. This dense water, collectively known as North Atlantic Deep\\nWater (NADW), sinks and flows southward, eventually upwelling in the Pacific\\nOcean where it is heated and returns to the North Atlantic as surface water. Antartic\\nBottom Water (AABW) and Lower Circumpolar Deep Water (LCDW), which are also\\nimportant sources of deep water in the global ocean, are formed around Antarctica.\\nNADW formation is thought to be the main \\'driver\\' of the THC (Broecker et al.,\\n1990) and plays a particularly important role in millennial-scale climate variability\\n(e.g. Weaver & Hughes, 1994; Marchitto et al., 1998; Bianchi & McCave, 1999;\\nCurry et al., 1999; Rodwell et al., 1999; Broecker, 2000; Keigwin & Boyle, 2000;\\nMarotzke, 2000; Arz et al., 2001; Clark et al., 2002; Marchitto & deMenocal, 2003;\\nOppo et al., 2003; Giraudeau et al., 2004; Hall et al., 2004). The formation of NADW\\nis often referred to as ocean \\'ventilation\\' and ventilation rates can change over time,\\ndepending on the \\'mode\\' of the THC in operation (Bond et al., 1999; Curry et al.,\\n1999). The THC system is sensitively balanced and though the THC is primarily\\nforced by thermically driven density differences, freshwater inputs significantly\\nimpact upon the system (figure 1.1 and Rahmstorf, 1995, 1996, 2000). Such\\nfreshwater injections have been attributed as the cause of the temporary slowdown (or\\nshutdown) of the THC during the Younger Dryas phase and the Holocene 8,200 year\\nevent (Broecker, 2003), though both Piotrowski et al., (2004) and Rohling & Piilike\\n(2005) suggest the causal factor of the 8.2 kyr BP cool event (and also the Younger\\nDryas phase) is yet to be determined.\\nRecent instrumental studies have shown large inter-annual and decadal variability in\\nNorth Atlantic Ocean conditions (Cayan, 1992; Chen & Ghil, 1995; Dickson et al.,\\n1996; Macdonald & Wunsch, 1996; Reverdin et al., 1997; Sutton & Allen, 1997;\\n3\\nChapter 1 Introduction\\nWhite et al., 1997; Ezer, 1999; Ganachaud & Wunsch, 2000; Ezer, 2001b, a; Furevik,\\n2001; Marshal] et al., 2001; Greene & Pershing, 2003; Keim et al., 2004; Wu & Liu,\\n2005). This variability is often linked to the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO; section\\n1.3) due to the strong atmosphere-ocean coupling (Marshall et al., 2001; Visbeck et\\nal., 2003 and references within); for example, the decadal frequency of the \\'Great\\nSalinity Anomalies\\' (GSA) appear to coincide with NAO phases (e.g. Dickson et al.,\\n1988; Belkin et al., 1998; Greene & Pershing, 2003; Belkin, 2004). Holliday (2003)\\ndemonstrated that water masses in the Rockall Trough (which contribute to NW\\nScottish coastal waters) were strongly coupled with the state of the NAO (section\\n2.17) and Kershaw et al., (2004) used geochemical tracers to show that North Atlantic\\ncurrent strengths were significantly influenced by the NAO.\\nThe seminal study by Hansen et al., (2001) showed that the overflow of dense, cold\\nwater (one of the main sources of NADW) south across the Greenland-Scotland ridge\\nhas reduced within the past 4 decades and recent studies have also shown that\\nsubpolar North Atlantic water is gradually becoming fresher (Dickson et al., 2002;\\nCurry et al., 2003; Dickson & Curry, 2003). Blindheim et al., (2000) links the\\nfreshening surface layer of the Norwegian Sea to the prolonged positive NAO state.\\nHansen et al., (2001) suggest a reduced overflow may signify a reduction in NADW\\nformation and ventilation, with the possibility of reduced latitudinal heat transport.\\nHowever, Dickson & Curry (2003) report no evidence of a change in the THC during\\nthe same period. Despite these uncertainties, the sensitivity of the THC to freshwater\\ninput at high and mid latitudes in clear (figure 1.1).\\n1.2.2 The ocean\\'s role in the global carbon cycle\\nThe oceans (particularly the surface oceans) are one of the largest of the fast\\nexchanging reservoirs in the global carbon cycle (Stacker, 2000), capable of\\nsignificantly influencing atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration and\\nsubsequently global temperatures (e.g. Petit et al., 1999). Oceanic processes can\\nmodulate atmospheric CO2 concentration via: (i) changes in ventilation rates, with\\nhigher natural CO2 (i.e. non-anthropogenic) during reduced NADW formation\\n(Broecker, 1997); (ii) increased upwelling, releasing stored deep ocean C02 into the\\natmosphere; (iii) marine primary productivity (Bigg, 1996); (iv) ocean temperature,\\n4\\nChapter 1 Introduction\\nwith CO2 typically more soluble in cooler waters (Chester, 1990) and (v) C02 storage\\nin marine calcium carbonate (CaCO^) which regulates the C02 saturation point of\\nocean water (Maslin et al., 2003). Recent anthropogenic forcing of climate, including\\nincreased C02 emissions and ocean warming, has raised concerns regarding the future\\nrole of oceanic uptake of C02, particularly since the impact of anthropogenic C02 is\\nalready evident in the ocean (e.g. Broecker, 1997; Stocker & Schmittner, 1997; Keir et\\nal., 1998; Gruber et al., 1999; Joos et al., 1999; Sonnerup et al., 1999; Gruber &\\nKeeling, 2001; Clark et al., 2002; Kortzinger et al., 2003; Quay et al., 2003; Feely et\\nal., 2004; Sabine et al., 2004).\\n1.3 The North Atlantic Oscillation\\nThe surface layer of the North Atlantic Ocean is strongly coupled with the overlying\\natmosphere (Czaja et al., 2003) and strong ocean-atmosphere interactions play an\\nimportant role in the climate of the North Atlantic region (e.g. Holliday, 2003).\\nThe North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) is the large-scale alternation of atmospheric\\nmass between the Icelandic Low and the Azores High and is determined by sea-level\\npressure (SLP) differences between these two regions (figure 1.2). For instance, a\\npositive NAO phase occurs when a strong high pressure system lies over the Azores\\nregion and a strong low pressure system lies over Iceland, resulting in a strong\\npressure gradient between the two regions. During a negative NAO phase, the\\npressure systems are much weaker, leading to a weaker pressure gradient. Wanner et\\nal., (2001) and Hurrell et al., (2003) provide excellent overviews of the NAO.\\nThe NAO is the dominant mode of atmospheric behaviour in the Northern\\nHemisphere throughout the year, becoming more prevalent during the winter months\\nwhere it accounts for more than one-third of the total variance in sea-level pressure\\n(Cayan, 1992) and is typically determined by the averaged monthly NAO indices from\\nDecember-January-February-March (Jones et al., 1997). Hurrell (1995) used data\\nobtained from stations at Lisbon, Portugal and Stykkisholmur, Iceland, and Jones et\\nal., (1997) used instrumental records from Gibraltar and Reykjavik. Although such\\nrecords differ in detail, the inter-annual trends seen within the two different indices are\\ngenerally consistent, showing for example, a positive phase between 1900 - 1930 AD,\\n5\\nChapter 1 Introduction\\nA) Stage 3 B) Holocene and long interstadials Q Last Glacial Maximum\\nand long stadials\\nr 0\\nY0\\nNorth Atlantic surface salinity\\nY0\\nNorth Atlantic surface salinity North Atlantic surface salinity\\nFigure 1.1 Threshold diagrams depicting one way in which 1-2 kyr climate cycle might have been amplified\\ninto Dansgaard/Oeschger cycles of the glaciation.

Positive (or\\nhigh index) phases of the NAO index are characterised by stronger than normal mid-\\nlatitude westerly winds (>8 ms\"1 above normal; Hurrell, 1995) and this storm track is\\ndeflected northwards by the high pressure system over the Azores, resulting in warmer\\nand wetter winters over NW Europe as the air masses travel over the warm Atlantic\\nocean. Conversely, a negative (low index) year sees a change in atmospheric\\ncirculation with the storm tracks deflected towards Southern Europe, resulting in cold,\\ndry winter conditions over NW Europe (e.g. Slonosky & Yiou, 2001; Ruprecht et al.,\\n2002; Trigo et al., 2002). Hurrell (1995) showed that correlation coefficients between\\nwinter (December-March) precipitation and the winter NAO index are stronger for\\nEuropean coastal stations (e.g. Bergen: 0.77 and Stornoway: 0.75) than for inland\\nstations (Oslo: 0.21 and Frankfurt: 0.19). Chandler and Wheater (2002) have also\\ndemonstrated the seasonally varying impact of the NAO upon rainfall variability from\\nthe west of Ireland.\\n1.3.1 Forcing mechanisms and cyclicity of the NAO\\nThe NAO is responsible for generating systematic large-amplitude changes of wind\\nspeed, latent and sensible heat fluxes, and hence sea surface temperatures over much\\nof the mid-latitude North Atlantic (Cayan, 1992; Reverdin et al., 1997; Visbeck et al.,\\n2003). In turn, the inter-annual and longer-term changes in the NAO index may\\ndetermine or modulate deep temperature and salinity (Reverdin et al., 1997) and hence\\ndeep convection in the Atlantic (Dickson et al., 1996). Inter-annual sea surface\\ntemperature (SST) anomalies generated by atmospheric variability in the NAO may be\\n\\'stored\\' underneath the seasonally stratified surface ocean layer and released during\\nwinter water column mixing, thus providing the ocean with a \\'memory\\' of\\natmospheric climate (e.g. McCartney, 1997; Sutton & Allen, 1997; White et al.,\\n1997). Czaja et al., (2003) suggests that whilst the Atlantic Ocean responds strongly\\nto NAO changes, the Atlantic Ocean modulates NAO variability rather than exhibiting\\n7\\nChapter 1 Introduction\\ncoupled ocean-atmosphere dynamics as does the Pacific Ocean with the El Nino-\\nSouthern Oscillation.\\nLong-term variability in the NAO index, reflecting the dominant mode of atmospheric\\nbehaviour in the North Atlantic region, has been observed at periodicities of around\\n-2, 7-10, 20-23, 70 and 80-90 years (Appenzeller et al., 1998 and references in\\nO\\'Sullivan et al., 2002) and the NAO has been identified as the likely mechanism\\n18\\nresponsible for periodic behaviour in the 5 O record of the GISP2 ice-core record\\nfrom central Greenland (White et al., 1996) during the late Holocene. However, many\\nof the observed cycles reported are statistically insignificant and hard to distinguish\\nfrom \\'red noise\\' (Appenzeller et al., 1998; Hurrell et al., 2003).\\n1.4 Millennial Scale Climate variability in the Late Quaternary\\nThe current geological period, the Quaternary, began around 2.1 million years before\\npresent (Ma BP) and consists of two geological epochs; the Pleistocene and the\\nHolocene. The Pleistocene lasted from -2.1 Ma BP to - 10 kyr BP (kyr BP =\\nthousand years before present) and is characterised by high amplitude and frequent\\noscillations between cold glacial periods and warm interglacial periods with at least 50\\ncold-temperature cycles occurring throughout this geological period (Lowe & Walker,\\n1997). The Holocene (meaning \\'wholly recent\\') is the most recent epoch of the\\nQuaternary period (though some regard it as the current interglacial of the Pleistocene;\\nLowe & Walker, 1997) commencing around 11.5 ka cal yr BP; Roberts, 1998).\\nThe seminal work of Emiliani (1955) and Shackleton (1967, 1974, 1977, 1987) on\\nstable oxygen isotope stratigraphy led to the subsequent identification of glacial-\\ninterglacial cycles and their pacing in marine sediment cores. Glacial-interglacial\\ncycles are primarily driven by the \\'Milankovitch\\' orbital cycles with periodicities of\\n~100ka (eccentricity), ~41ka (obliquity) and ~23ka and ~19ka (precessional cycles)\\nand are clearly evident in both ocean and ice cores (Lowe & Walker, 1997).\\nHowever, the recent advent of high-resolution proxy records from ice core, terrestrial\\nand marine sediment archives have demonstrated that climatic cycles on sub-\\nMilankovitch (or millennial) time-scales also exist (e.g. table 1.1); exemplifying the\\n8\\nChapter 1 Introduction\\npotential for abrupt and rapid climate change to occur throughout recent Earth history\\n(e.g. Alley, 2000).\\n18\\nStable oxygen isotope records (5 O; proxies of temperature at the time of\\nprecipitation and deposition) from high resolution, often annually layered, Greenland\\nice cores, clearly exemplify the pervasive millennial-scale climatic variability of the\\nlate Quaternary (figure 1.3 and Johnsen et al., 1992; Dansgaard et al., 1993; Larsen et\\nal., 1995; White et al., 1996; Dahl-Jensen et al., 1998; Stauffer, 1999; Walker et al.,\\n1999; Chambers & Brain, 2002; Andersen et al., 2004). Such millennial-scale climate\\ncycles are particularly evident in glacial periods, where short -1,500 year Dansgaard-\\nOeschger (DO) cycles result in alternating warm interstadials and cold stadials\\n(Dansgaard et al., 1993), and are characteristically grouped into longer Bond cycles\\n(Alley, 1998) in North Atlantic marine sediment cores. Bond et al., (1993)\\ndemonstrated that the millennial scale glacial DO events evident in the Greenland ice\\ncores were strongly coupled with ocean proxies suggesting cool temperatures and\\n\\'Heinrich events\\' (ice rafted detritus or IRD, in marine sediment) deposited during the\\ndischarge of icebergs into the North Atlantic (Bond et al., 1992; Bond & Lotti, 1995;\\nAndrews, 1998). The penecontemporeanous occurrence of DO cycles in the ice core\\nand millennial-scale cycles in marine cores point to a closely coupled ocean-\\natmosphere climate system at least throughout the last glacial maximum (LGM).\\n1.5 Holocene Climate\\n1.5.1 Millennial-scale variability in the Holocene\\nThere is no doubt that Holocene climate is more stable than that of the last glacial\\nperiod (figure 1.3). However, Denton & Karlen (1973) studied glacier advances\\nacross Europe and were the first to suggest that Holocene climate demonstrated\\nmillennial-scale climate variability. Despite this early find, Holocene climate was still\\nperceived as being relatively stable well into the 1990s (e.g. Dansgaard et al., 1993). It\\nwasn\\'t until O\\' Brien et al., (1995) illustrated the complexity of salts and terrestrial\\ndust in a Greenland ice core that the concept of an unstable Holocene climate began to\\nbe more widely accepted (Bond et al., 1997). Records of atmospheric climate change\\nhad already been correlated with marine climate records for the last glacial period\\n(Bond et al., 1993), and seminal work carried out by Bond et al., (1997) demonstrated\\n9\\nChapter 1 Introduction\\nTable 1.1\\nSelected Holocene (quasi)-periods from palaeoclimate proxy records\\nfrom the North Atlantic region (NA) and the Greenland GISP2 ice core.Taken from\\nSchulz etal., 2004\\nProxy record Periodicity (years) Reference\\nNA, drift ice\\nNA, benthic foraminiferal\\nabundance\\nNA, sediment colour\\nNA, planktonic foraminifera\\n8180\\nNA, mean size of sortable silt\\nGISP2,8180,\\nGISP2, potassium\\n400-500,900- 1100 Bond etat., 2001\\n-400- 1300 Sarnthein etal., 2003\\n550,1000, ~ 1600?

Climate records show 6 RCC events occurring at cycles of 2800-2000\\nyears and 1500 years in the North Atlantic region. The most severe of these climatic\\ndeteriorations occurred between 9-8 kyr BP, termed the Glacial aftermath RCC (GA-\\nRCC) by Mayewski et al., (2004), where most of the northern hemisphere experienced\\nhigh latitude cooling and low latitude aridity (Mayewski et al., 2004). Initially this\\ncooling event, easily visible in Greenland ice core records (temperature decrease of ~\\n4-8 °C) and North Atlantic records (~ 1.5 - 3 °C decrease) was attributed to a slow¬\\ndown/stagnation of the THC arising from a freshwater pulse into the North Atlantic\\nfrom the Laurentide ice sheet, occurring around 8.2 kyr BP (Alley et al., 1997; Barber\\net al., 1999a). However, Rohling & Palike (2005) point out that climatic deterioration\\npreceded the 8.2 kyr BP meltwater spike (figure 1.4), suggesting a cause other than\\nTHC variability is responsible for the GA-RCC cooling. This view is supported by\\nPiotrowski et al., (2004) who report a strong link between North Atlantic climate and\\ndeep ocean circulation but no evidence of meltwater pulses significantly influencing\\nNADW formation. Additionally, Mayewski et al., (2004) suggest that a decrease in\\nsummer insolation and volcanically forced climate may have lead to the climatic\\ndeterioration in the GA-RCC.\\n1.5.2 Possible causes ofclimatic variability in the Holocene\\nThough the GA-RCC provides an insight of how possible THC stagnation can\\nabruptly affect global climate, the event occurred during a time when ice sheets were\\nstill retreating, thus such large changes invoked by meltwater pulses are unlikely to\\noccur in modern times. However, after the GA-RCC, climatic deteriorations can be\\nseen to pervade the Holocene on millennial time scales. For example, Mayewski et\\nal., (2004 and references within) show fairly severe and extensive Holocene climatic\\ndeteriorations occurring between 6-5 kyr BP and 3.5-2.5 kyr BP, with a global climate\\n11\\nChapter 1 Introduction\\n4000 6000 8000 10000\\n/VV^\\'\\nyIceland Low\\nTipatmamine, Morocco\\nO -6.5\\n«0\\n*e\\n1-6.0-5.5-5.0\\'\\n2000 4000 6000 8000 10000\\nAge (cat B2k)\\n10 ?

Two other RCC events occurring between 4.2-3.8\\nkyr BP and 1.2-1 kyr BP are less extensive and their causal factors are harder to\\npinpoint. The last event, lasting from 0.6 kyr BP differs from the others in that it\\ndisplays \\'cool poles, wet tropics\\' and again this has been linked to changes in solar\\nforcing (e.g. Beer et al., 2000; Bond et al., 2001; Mayewski et al., 2004).\\nMany late Holocene records show periodicities on millennial, centennial and decadal\\nscales (e.g. O\\'Sullivan et al., 2002). The pacing of the Holocene RCC events at 1450\\n± 500 years appears to be statistically similar to the glacial DO events (Bond et al.,\\n1997) and Bond et al., (1999) suggest that the North Atlantic possess a 1-2 kyr climate\\nrhythm, with glacial DO events representing amplifications of the Holocene RCC\\nmillennial cycles brought about by THC sensitivity to freshwater injections into the\\nNorth Atlantic. However, the actual driving mechanisms of these millennial scale\\nchanges are yet to be established.\\nInternal forcing\\nThe volume, high specific heat capacity, inertia and response time on the scale of\\nhundreds to thousands of years, make the oceans a prime candidate for driving and\\nsustaining internal Holocene climate change on millennial time scales (Maslin et al.,\\n2003). The seminal work of Bianchi & McCave (1999) investigating sediment grain\\nsizes in North Atlantic marine sediment cores illustrated the importance of the ocean\\nin driving millennial-scale climate change. They suggest that decreases in the mean\\nsize of the sortable silt fraction point to a reduction in the intensity of NADW\\nformation and link these periods of sluggish current activity to proxies of climatic\\ndeteriorations in the GISP2 ice core.\\nHowever, external forcing must often be invoked to account for ocean variability (e.g.\\nElliot et al., 2002) and suggestions include ice sheet instability with internal\\noscillations resulting in episodic freshwater injections into the region of NADW\\n13\\nChapter 1 Introduction\\n«S g-20\\nj? \\'£.\\n§8\\n(h) | |\\no|r 10\\n290\\n(k)\\n280\\nO\\nQ\\n_\\nu o\\nH (5\\ns f. are-\\nC ®\\n*2 —\\n2000\\n2000\\n4000 6000 8000 10000\\nNorth America\\n%rv»mr than pfSSZsat t \\'\\nLate Agastiz outbreak (e)\\nFigure 1.5 Climate forcing series and globally distributed discontinuous glacier advance records plus\\nGISP2 proxy for atmospheric circulation, included as a continuous record example.

Bond et al., (2001) showed that proxies of North Atlantic drift ice (IRD\\nevents) are strongly coupled with proxies of solar variability (10Be and 14C) in\\nGreenland ice cores, and suggested that changes in solar output during the Holocene\\ninfluenced the surface hydrography of the North Atlantic and thus NADW formation\\n(see also van Geel et al., 2003). However, Maslin et al., (2003) question how robust\\nthe Bond et al., (2001) hypothesis can be, given that both 10Be and 14C can be\\ninfluenced by climate change, such as ocean ventilation (Campin et al., 1999; Beck et\\nal., 2001) and precipitation. Irrespective of this, van Geel et al., (2003) point out that\\ngiven the similarity between the DO-like events during both glacial and interglacial\\nperiods (Bond et al., 1997; Bond et al., 1999) and the identification of climatic\\nvariability close to this periodicity across the globe (e.g. Campbell et al.,\\n1998;Voelker, 2002), it is likely that these RCC events are driven by an external\\nforcing, most likely solar output. Rial (2004) suggests that DO oscillations may be\\nlinked to a frequency modulate harmonic of precessional (orbital) forcing, with\\nclimate operating between chaos and order, again linking millennial scale variability\\nto solar forcing mechanisms. Rahmstorf (2003) also suggests that the precise pacing\\nof the 1,470 cycles points to an external forcing mechanism, whilst Clemens (2005)\\nimplies that the 1,470 cycle is an artifact of the ice core age model and that millennial-\\nscale abrupt climate changes are linked to centennial (probably solar) variability.\\nSchulz et al., (2004) also suggests no dominant periodicity exists in the Holocene and\\nquestions the link between solar forcing and the 1,470 cycle.\\n1.5.3 Centennial and decadal-scale climatic variability in the Holocene\\nThe recent increase in the number of high resolution palaeoclimatic studies has\\nbrought centennial and decadal variability to the fore-front of research and some\\nstudies suggest that millennial-scale variability seen in palaeoclimatic archives are\\n15\\nChapter 1 Introduction\\nlikely to be a reflection of centennial-scale climate cycles (e.g. Wunsch, 2000;\\nClemens, 2005).\\nCentennial-scale climate variability (coherent with ice core climate cycles) has been\\nobserved in North Atlantic marine sediment cores (e.g. table 1.1), in ice core records\\n(e.g. Meeker & Mayewski, 2002), in peat bog records (e.g. Chambers & Blackford,\\n2001), in speleothem records (McDermott et al., 2001) and in instrumental records\\n(O\\'Sullivan et al., 2002). Though solar forcing is most likely responsible for\\ncentennial climate change, Hall et al., (2004) present data which suggest a direct\\nlinkage between surface processes and circulation changes in the deep Iceland-\\nScotland overflow component of meridional overturning circulation.\\nImproved understanding of the North Atlantic Oscillation (e.g. Marshall et al., 2001;\\nWu & Liu, 2005) and it\\'s strong coupling with the ocean (section 1.3) has sparked\\ninterest in the influence of this ocean-atmosphere interaction upon climate (e.g.\\nDrinkwater et al., 2003; Mysterud et al., 2003). For example, in the NE Atlantic\\nregion, NAO variability has been observed in the Greenland ice cores (e.g.\\nAppenzeller et al., 1998; Barlow, 2001; Meeker & Mayewski, 2002; Dawson et al.,\\n2003). Radiocarbon tracers (AI4C) from the annual growth bands of tropical corals\\nsuggest the North Atlantic Ocean has experienced several \\'pulses\\' in ventilation\\nduring the last century (Druffel, 1997), whilst A14C records from the long-lived\\nmollusc Arctica islandica records mixing at the Georges Bank/Labrador Sea region of\\nthe North Atlantic and points to periods of reduced NADW between 1960-1970\\n(Weidman & Jones, 1993). Additionally, Abrantes et al., (in press) relate the Tagus\\nRiver (Portugal) discharge to NAO forced climate; Schone et al., (2003) have\\nobserved NAO driven changes in molluscan shell chemistry; Proctor et al., (2002) link\\nchanges in speleothem geochemistry to the NAO, and hydrographic changes in\\nScandinavian fjords have been attributed to the NAO (section 1.8.5).\\nO\\'Sullivan et al., (2002) suggest that many palaeorecords detecting NAO periodicities\\nare in fact artefacts of the smoothing of the data, however it is likely that the North\\nAtlantic may be modulating climatic variability at a multidecadal time scale (Chen &\\nGhil, 1995; Chapman & Shackleton, 2000; Cooper et al., 2000; Delworth & Mann,\\n16\\nChapter 1 Introduction\\n2000; Kerr, 2000; McDermott et al., 2001; Meeker & Mayewski, 2002; O\\'Sullivan et\\nah, 2002; Rohling et al., 2002; Risebrobakken et al., 2003; Schonfeld et al., 2003;\\nHall et al., 2004; Andresen et al., 2005), and Kerr (2000) suggests this multidecadal\\npacemaker could go by the name of the \\'Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation\\'.\\n1.6 Late Holocene climate in the North Atlantic region\\nWithin the past few decades attention has turned to late Holocene (past 2 kyr) climate\\nvariability (e.g. Barber et al., 1999b; Chambers & Brain, 2002) and research generated\\nin this thesis comntributed to the European Union funded Framework V project\\nHOLSMEER (Late Holocene Shallow Marine Environments of Europe).\\nIn the North Atlantic region, the last 2 millennia are marked by 4 climatic phases: the\\nRoman Warm Period (RWP), the Dark Ages Cold Period (DACP), the Medieval\\nWarm Period (MWP) and the Little Ice Age (LIA). The latter climatic event, the LIA,\\nis particularly important since it: (i) coincides with the Maunder Minimum of solar\\nactivity (Reid, 1997; Beer et al., 2000; Luterbacher et al., 2001; Shindell et al., 2001);\\n(ii) occurs during a phase of sluggish current activity in the NE Atlantic (Bianchi &\\nMcCave, 1999); and (iii) is thought to be linked to the 1-2 kyr climate cycles which\\npervade palaeorecords from the late Quaternary (Bond et al., 1999). Volcanic\\neruptions can impact upon global climate (Zielinski, 2000) and volcanic aerosols may\\nhave also contributed to LIA cooling, particularly at the time of its onset (e.g. Shindell\\net al., 2003; Mayewski et al., 2004). The LIA also provides a good test of palaeo-\\ndata, since it has a small but defined signal relative to the deglaciation signal\\n(Jennings et al., 2001) and coincides with the commencement of instrumental data\\ncollection.\\n1.6.1 Anthropogenic influence on Late Holocene climate\\nChambers & Brain (2002) report a paradigm shift in the study of Late Holocene\\nclimate, primarily due to interest in anthropogenic activity upon natural climate\\nvariability. Excellent reviews of climate during the past two millennia can be found in\\nMann & Park (1994), Mann et al., (1998), Crowley (2000), Mann (2001), Shindell et\\nal., (2001), Mann & Jones (2003) and Moberg et al., (2005).\\n17\\nChapter 1 Introduction\\nPrior to 1800 AD (i.e. before the Industrial Revolution) decadal climate variability\\nwas significantly influenced by natural factors with solar irradiance and volcanic\\nforcing accounting for 41-64 % of climate variability (Crowley, 2000). Mann & Jones\\n(2003) report that the northern hemisphere is currently experiencing the highest\\ntemperatures of the past 2 millennia, i.e. significantly warmer than the regional\\n\\'Medieval Warm Period\\', and it is now widely accepted that 20th and 21st century\\nclimate has and continues to be forced by anthropogenic activity (Mann et al., 1998;\\nCrowley, 2000), to the point that Crutzen (2002) suggests the last -150 years should\\nbe renamed the \\'Anthropocene\\'. However, recent work by Moberg et al., (2005)\\nusing combined high and low resolution proxies from marine and terrestrial archives,\\nsuggests climatic variations are likely to have been much more variable than those\\nproposed by previous studies (figure 1.6). This corroborates the earlier suggestions of\\nMarchitto & deMenocal (2003), whose reconstruction of NADW bottom water\\ntemperature suggests greater temporal variability (-2 °C) than reported in previous\\nstudies. Moberg et al., (2005) also propose that natural climate variability is still a\\nsignificant factor in global climate change, despite anthropogenic forcing and suggest\\nnatural climate variability could amplify or attenuate anthropogenic climate change.\\nDespite global attempts, such as the Kyoto Protocol, to curb anthropogenic\\ngreenhouse gas exports into the atmosphere (e.g. Reilly et al., 1999; O\\'Neill &\\nOppenheimer, 2002), the Earth\\'s energy balance and large thermal inertia is such that\\nglobal temperatures are predicted to continue to rise. The climatic implications of\\nrising global temperatures are likely to be severe (Hansen et al., 2004) and the\\nfeedback mechanisms from the underlying natural variability of the climate system are\\nunknown. The need to improve the understanding of natural climatic variability and\\nthe role of the oceans in future climate is both clear and urgent (cf.

Additionally,\\nthe deep sea record may not be responsive enough to account for the rapid millennial-\\nscale changes documented in terrestrial archives.\\n1.7.1 Shelf seas as sites ofpalaeoenvironmental interest\\nShallow shelf seas and slope regions are usually areas of high sediment accumulation\\nrates, proffering the potential for high resolution palaeoclimatic studies. Shelf seas\\ntypically experience seasonal stratification (e.g. Pingree & Griffiths, 1978) and\\nsubsequently are zones of enhanced primary production (Berger et al., 1989). They\\ncontribute at least 20 % of global marine primary productivity (net production ~ 6 x\\n109 tons yr\"1; Walsh et al., 1981) whilst accounting for only ~ 10 % of the ocean floor\\narea. Shelf sea areas are sensitive to climatic processes (e.g. Backhaus, 1989, 1990,\\n1996) and provide a link between the terrestrial and deep-sea environments. Scourse\\n& Austin (2002 and references within) note their importance in studies of\\npalaeoclimate, glacio-eustatic sea-level change and potential to capture land-ocean\\ninteractions.\\n1.7.2 Fjords as recorders ofpalaeoenvironmental andpalaeoclimate change\\nFjords (sea lochs) are unique shelf sea marine environments in the sense that they\\nbridge the land-ocean interface, maintaining contact with the global oceans but also\\npenetrating deep into the coastline. The geomorphology of the fjordic catchment and\\nassociated weathering processes, together with enhanced flocculation processes due to\\nthe mixing of freshwater and saline water within the fjord (Open University, 1997),\\n20\\nChapter 1 Introduction\\ncombine to produce a marine environment with very high sediment accumulation rates\\n(e.g. Gilbert, 2000). The underlying geology of the fjords with their deep basins\\nseparated by shallow sills, often provide areas of sediment focussing thereby\\nincreasing the potential for high-resolution studies (e.g. Howe et al., 2002).\\n1.8 Background to Fjords: hydrographic processes and previous studies\\n1.8.1 Definition\\nScottish sea lochs (or fjords) are essentially glacially carved valleys which have been\\ninundated by the sea, thus they are similar to the fjords, sounds and inlets found in\\nother high-latitude locations (such as Norway, Sweden, Iceland, Greenland, Canada,\\nNew Zealand and Chile).\\nClassification of fjordic hydrography is difficult due to different schemes and\\nvariability in circulation due to climatic forcing (Farmer & Freeland, 1983).\\nHowever, fjords are usually much longer than they are wide and are characterised by\\ntheir steep sided walls, usually contain a number of shallow submarine sills which\\nseparate deep basins and have a relatively large fluvial input at the loch head (Farmer\\n& Freeland, 1983).\\n1.8.2 Fjordic hydrography\\nCoastal water conditions can influence the circulation in a sea loch or fjord system,\\ne.g. wind conditions and resulting geostrophic currents (Klinck et al., 1981) and\\ndifferences in offshore density conditions (Aure et al., 1996). However, the\\ninteraction between coastal waters and fjordic circulation is complex (Farmer &\\nFreeland, 1983) and will not be discussed here.\\n1.8.2.1 Stratified water columns\\nSea lochs typically display fjordic hydrography which differs from other estuarine\\ncirculation types (Farmer & Freeland, 1983; OpenUniversity, 1997). Physical\\noceanographical processes (such as mixing via wind stress, diffusivity, and internal\\n21\\nChapter I Introduction\\nand barotropic tides) occurring within most fjords are complex (figure 1.7) and are\\ncovered in great detail by Farmer & Freeland (1983).\\nA fjordic water column usually consists of three water masses. A brackish surface\\nwater layer, where high freshwater inputs from rivers and surface runoff mixes with\\nbasin waters, is characterised by salinities as low as 10. This layer is usually fairly\\nthin (~ 5-10 m in Loch Sunart; figure 1.8) but can be modified with varying\\nfreshwater inputs. A well defined halocline separates the brackish surface water layer\\nfrom the intermediate layer (figure 1.8). At the sill region, mixing of the surface water\\nwith coastal waters (Elliott et al., 1992) and the subsequent entrainment of this low\\nsalinity water into the basin results in the formation of an intermediate layer of higher\\nsalinity than the surface water but lower salinity than coastal water (figure 1.8).\\nSaline deep water enters the basin via exchange or flushing of the fjord by coastal\\nwaters during an important process in fjordic hydrography: deep water renewal events\\n(section 1.8.2.3).\\n1.8.2.2 Seasonal stratification\\nAs Farmer & Freeland (1983) point out, fjordic hydrography is not constant\\nthroughout the year. Periods of high runoff typically result in a strongly stratified\\nwater column with the brackish surface layer extending far along the axis of the fjord,\\nwhereas during periods of low freshwater inputs stratification is much weaker (figure\\n1.9).\\nHydrography also changes due to seasonal stratification. Increased warming of the\\nsurface water layer due to increased mid- to high-latitude summer insolation\\nstrengthens the thermocline and results in a stratified water column. The break-down\\nof the seasonal thermocline during the winter months along with strong mixing\\nprocesses and convective overturning (figure 1.7) leads to a fairly homogenous water\\ncolumn. Whilst sea lochs with a very high freshwater input may experience year-long\\nstratification (as with the Clyde Sea; Bock et al., 1999), seasonal observational data\\nfrom Loch Sunart suggests a mixed water column during the winter months (figure\\n1.10, data from Dr. P. Gillibrand).\\n22\\nChapter 1 Introduction\\nFigure 1.7. The complexity of physical processes occurring in a fjord. Full descriptions of these\\nprocesses are covered in Farmer & Freeland (1983).

Deep basin water is usually stagnant and isolated from saline coastal\\nwaters (via sills and a stratified water column) and experiences gradual freshening via\\ndiffusive mixing with the overlying lower salinity intermediate water (Inall &\\nRippeth, 2002 and figure 1.8). When the density of the sill water exceeds the density\\nof the deep basin water, saline dense coastal water flows into the basin to replace the\\nless dense and fresher deep basin water (e.g. Gillibrand et al., 1995; Allen & Simpson,\\n1998). During this process, \\'old\\' deep basin water is \\'lifted\\' up and transported out of\\nthe loch. DWREs often occur during periods of low runoff into the fjord, since a\\nshallow halocline allows coastal water to \\'slip\\' over the sill and \\'renew\\' the salinity of\\nthe deep basin water. Though deep water renewal events in sea lochs are driven\\nlargely by the easily identifiable density changes associated with salinity fluctuations\\n(e.g. Gade & Edwards, 1980; Farmer & Freeland, 1983), temperature changes\\n(positive or negative) may accompany the inflow of coastal waters depending on the\\nsurface water temperature at the time of the DWRE (e.g. Gillibrand et al., 1995; Allen\\n& Simpson, 1998; Austin & Inall, 2002).\\n1.8.3 Response of fjordic hydrography to climatic change\\nThe sensitivity of fjordic circulation to wind forcing and freshwater inputs (e.g. Gade\\n& Edwards, 1980; Farmer & Freeland, 1983) means that the variability in both coastal\\nand catchment conditions is likely to impact upon these environments. This can be\\ntested through the comparison of climatic data series (such as the NAO index) with\\ninstrumental records of fjordic hydrography. For instance, Kristensen et al., (2004)\\ndemonstrated that basin water temperatures in Sognesjpen (at 300 m water depth)\\nreflected marine temperatures recorded at the coastal station OWS Mike and air\\ntemperatures recorded in Bergen, and showed good agreement with the Hurrell (1995)\\nNAO index. Recently, Gillibrand et al., (2005) utilised exisiting circulation models\\nfrom Loch Sunart (Elliott et al., 1992; Gillibrand et al., 1995) to explore the response\\nof main basin and inner basin circulation to climatic forcing during two recent\\nextreme NAO years, namely 1988/89 (+2.86) and 1995/96 (-2.32; Jones et al., 1997).\\nFull details of the latter study are presented in chapter 3. In summary, the main basin\\nshowed a negligible salinity change to recent NAO forcing, whilst the inner basin\\n25\\nChapter 1 Introduction\\nshowed a clear response, with frequent DWREs occurring during negative NAO years\\nand less frequent DWREs during the positive NAO state. However, Ameborg (2004)\\nfinds no link between the NAO and instrumental data recording basin exchange in the\\nGullmar fjord between 1956 - 1984. This may be a function of the fairly deep sill (~\\n42 m) in the Gullmar Fjord, somewhat analogous to the deep sill (-31 m) at the\\nentrance of the main basin of Loch Sunart.\\nSince marine ecosystems typically show a strong response to NAO-forced oceanic\\nconditions (e.g. Drinkwater et al., 2003 and references within), climatic data series\\nsuch as the NAO index can be compared with instrumental records of fjordic\\nhydrography or with recent palaeoenvironmental records (usually spanning less than\\n100 years). The majority of such studies have focused on the shallow silled, restricted\\nfjords of Sweden (e.g. Gustafsson & Nordberg, 2000; Nordberg et al., 2000;\\nGustafsson & Nordberg, 2001; Nordberg et al., 2001; Gustafsson & Nordberg, 2002;\\nFilipsson & Nordberg, 2004a, b) with periods of infrequent basin exchange and\\nassociated low oxygen concentration occuring during phases of positive NAO index.\\nKristensen et al., (2004) also demonstrate good agreement between palaeoclimate, as\\nrecorded by benthic foraminiferal proxies from a deep silled Norwegian fjord and\\nNorth Atlantic temperature changes over the past 100 years.\\n1.8.4 Fjords as recorders of palaeoenvironmental and palaeoclimate change\\nOn a centennial/millennial time-scale, palaeoclimatic and palaeoenvironmental studies\\nhave been carried out in many Scandinavian and Icelandic fjordic environments,\\nparticularly during the past decade (e.g. Alve, 1995; Kristensen et al., 1995; Aarseth,\\n1997; Grosfjeld et al., 1999; Kelly et al., 1999; Nordberg et al., 2000; Mikalsen et al.,\\n2001; Nordberg et al., 2001; Sejrup et al., 2001; Gustafsson & Nordberg, 2002; Howe\\net al., 2002; Plassen & Vorren, 2002; Hald et al., 2003; Filipsson & Nordberg, 2004b;\\nHusum & Hald, 2004; Kristensen et al., 2004; Lysa et al., 2004; Smittenberg et al.,\\n2005). Where the fjord is deep silled, palaeoenvironmental proxies suggest fjordic\\nbottom water reliably records NE Atlantic circulation (e.g. Mikalsen et al., 2001;\\nKristensen et al., 2004), whilst shallow-silled, restricted fjords provide good records\\nof NAO influence (e.g. Nordberg et al., 2000; Nordberg et al., 2001; Filipsson &\\nNordberg, 2004b).\\n26\\nChapter 1 Introduction\\nDespite the clear potential for obtaining high-resolution palaeoenvironmental records\\nfrom fjords, few studies have addressed palaeoenvironmental change in temperate\\nScottish sea lochs. Palaeoenvironmental work in the sea lochs of NW Scotland have\\nfocused upon depositional regimes across the Late Glacial - Holocene transition (Dix\\n& Duck, 2000; Howe et al., 2002) or recent (last 200 years) environmental change in\\nthe near-anoxic Loch Etive (Murray et al., 2003) which is not comparable to the well\\nventilated Loch Sunart (Edwards & Sharpies, 1986). Modern studies in Loch Sunart\\nand other sea lochs have primarily been concerned with circulation processes (Elliott\\net al., 1992; Gillibrand et al., 1995; Gillibrand et al., 2005) or fishery studies\\n(Treasurer, 2001; McKenzie et al., 2004). Thus, the work presented in this thesis is\\nthe first attempt to provide a synthesis of modern surface samples (sedimentological,\\nfaunal and geochemical) related to modern environmental gradients, framed by an\\nevaluation of processes and aimed at generating high resolution palaeoclimatic\\nrecords.\\n1.9 Thesis aims and objectives\\nThe main aim of this thesis is to investigate the potential of obtaining high resolution\\npalaeoenvironmental records from Loch Sunart, a fjord on the NW coast of Scotland.\\nFor this purpose, a ~3 m sediment core was obtained from the main basin of Loch\\nSunart during April 2001 (chapter 2) with a resolution of approximately 0.1 cm yr 1\\nback to 2090 ± 120 years BP.\\nLittle palaeoenvironmental work has been undertaken in Scottish sea lochs and there\\nis a need to understand how modern processes influence the study site before reliable\\nreconstructions of these palaeoenvironments can be achieved. To this end, the\\nobjectives of this thesis can be broadly divided into two parts; an improved\\nunderstanding of modern processes and the generation of palaeoenvironmental\\nrecords. Given the broad spectrum of work presented here, each chapter of this thesis\\nis intended to provide a short introduction and a full discussion of the data relating to\\nthe major theme studied. It is hoped that each chapter will eventually yield a peer-\\nreviewed publication.\\n27\\nChapter I Introduction\\nFollowing an introduction to the topic (chapter 1) and a materials and methods section\\n(chapter 2), the thesis is structured so that modem processes are dealt with first\\n(chapters 3, 4, 5 and 6) and then palaeoenvironmental reconstructions follow in\\nchapters 7 and 8. A final chapter (chapter 9) provides an overview of the main\\nfindings and a conclusion to the thesis.\\nThe aims of the thesis are as follows:\\n1.9.1 Modern processes:\\nChapter 3 -Instrumental records from NW Scotland: Climate and Hydrography\\na) To determine whether regional indices of long-term climate (Jones & Lister,\\n2004) can explain the weather experienced by the Loch Sunart catchment area,\\nand to investigate the link between regional marine temperatures and air\\ntemperatures in context with indices of inter-annual climatic variability such as\\nthe North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO).\\nb) To test whether the fjordic circulation of Loch Sunart is influenced by extreme\\nstates of the NAO.

The loch is approximately 31 km long and averages at\\n1.5 km wide, with a total of 6 sills (Edwards & Sharpies, 1986 and table 2.1).\\nHowever, two sills (1 and 6; table 2.1) essentially section the loch into three basins.\\nThe inner basin has a maximum depth of 96 m and a sill depth of -10 m; the main\\nbasin is 124 m deep with a sill depth of -35 m, and the outer basin has an average\\ndepth of around 60 m with no sill restricting connection with the Sound of Mull. The\\nbathymetry of Loch Sunart is summarised figure 2.2.\\nThe catchment area (299 km2) of Loch Sunart is predominantly high relief land (> 600\\nm; figure 2.1) with relatively thin and poorly developed soils, rapidly translating\\nrainfall into surface runoff (Black & Cranston, 1995). Bare surfaces are common,\\nparticularly on the steep high slopes, though vegetation exists around streams and\\nwoodland occurs around the shores of the loch, particularly on the northern side\\n(figure 1.13). As with most places in the Highlands, the area around Loch Sunart has\\nexperienced deforestation, particularly during the Highland Clearances\\n(www.sunartoaklands.co.uk), however there has been a recent move towards\\nreforestation of the Sunart oaklands during the past decade (pers. comm., Ms. E.\\nMadden, Lochaber Countryside Ranger, Highland Council, 2002).\\n2.1.2 Formation ofLoch Sunart and local geology\\nSea lochs are glacially carved valleys which have been inundated by the sea, thus they\\nare similar to the fjords found in Norway, and are remnants of the glacial history of\\nScotland and the controls imposed by the underlying bedrock geology. Glacier\\ntongues spreading west from the centre of ice accumulation around Rannoch Moor\\neroded the local geology creating overdeepend valleys. During the Last Glacial\\nMaximum (LGM), the British ice sheet extended beyond the present day shoreline and\\nonto the continental shelf, and geomorphological observations in the area around Loch\\nSunart suggests the Loch Lomond (Younger Dryas) Re-advance reached the inner\\n30\\nChapter 2 Study area, materials and methods\\nPolloch\\nStrontian\\nLoch SunarX\\nLoch Teacuis\\n^Tobermory\\nTiree\\nLocation of\\nstudy area\\nFigure 2.1 Location of Loch Sunart on the NW coast of Scotland.

Additionally, glacial features can be\\nseen in seismic surveys of the loch, e.g. de Greer type glacial moraines, possible kettle\\nholes and pro-glacial delta stratigraphies (Baltzer et al, in press).\\nThe bedrock geology of the Ardnamurchan peninsula and area surrounding Loch\\nSunart comprises primarily of igneous and metamorphic rocks which are relatively\\nresistant to glacial erosion. Inner basin bedrock geology is primarily intrusive granite,\\nwhilst the main and outer basin bedrock geology consists of metamorphic rocks from\\nthe Moine formation (British Geological Survey, 1979). Sill locations coincide with\\nbelts of extremely resistant schists and both the inner basin and the main basin show\\nclassical glacial over-deepening towards the western end of basins, attributed to\\nglacial pinching controlled by the resistant bedrock at sill locations (pers. comm., Dr.\\nRichard Bates, from hereon CRB, University of St Andrews, 2004). The Quaternary\\ngeology of the area shows areas of peat (particularly in the upper basin catchment),\\nboulder clay and morainic drift (British Geological Survey, 1977).\\n2.1.3 Sedimentary characteristics ofLoch Sunart\\nBiotype mapping via geophysical techniques were carried out during a recent Scottish\\nNatural Heritage survey (figures 2.5; Bates et al., 2002). Sediments in the basins of\\nLoch Sunart are typically fine grained (< 63 pm) with high organic matter content,\\nparticularly in the inner basin, where inputs of terrigeneous matter become trapped\\n(chapter 8), whilst sill areas are characterised by either thin packages of coarse grained\\nsediment overlying sill rock or by bare rock. Sediment focussing does not necessarily\\noccur in deep areas due to the influences of current activity (e.g. tidal currents can\\npropagate to the sea floor; Gillibrand et al., 1996). Sediment accumulation is not even\\nthroughout the loch (exemplified by figure 2.6) and thin sediment packages can occur\\nin deep basins whilst thicker packages may be found on shallow shelf areas (pers.\\ncomm., CRB, 2004).\\n34\\nChapter 2 Study area, materials and methods\\n1 MULL\\nFigure 2.3 Satellite image of Loch Sunart (A) and the surrounding catchment area.

Loch Sunart exhibits\\ntypical fjordic hydrography (see section 1.8.2), with a brackish surface layer and\\ngenerally higher salinity waters with increasing depth (figures 1.9 and 1.10). The\\nwater column is highly stratified in the summer months and well mixed in the winter\\nmonths (figure 1.10).\\nApproximately 50% of the freshwater input to the loch enters the upper basin,\\nprimarily via the sub-catchment areas of the major rivers Strontian and Carnoch,\\nwhich account for -70 km2 of the total sea loch catchment area. Loch Sunart\\nexperiences semi-diurnal tides with ranges of 4 m for spring tides and 1 m for neaps.\\nThe small freshwater discharge: tidal ratio of Loch Sunart with respect to other\\nScottish sea lochs (e.g. Loch Etive; Edwards & Sharpies, 1986) likely contributes to\\nthe frequent flushing of this sea loch (Gillibrand et al., 1995).\\nThe deep waters of the main basin are typically more saline (~ 34) than the inner basin\\ndeep waters (-33; figures 1.9 and 1.10), due to the proximity to the saline coastal\\nwater source and the main basin\\'s deep sill which results in fairly unrestricted\\nconnection to Atlantic coastal waters. DWREs occur at least monthly in the inner\\nbasin (Gillibrand et al., 1995) when south-westerly winds enhance estuarine\\ncirculation thus increasing the density of water at sill depth by removing low salinity\\nwater from the sill region. In combinations with a low runoff, this results in a weakly\\nstratified water column and increased likelihood of a DWRE.\\n2.1.5 Loch Sunart basin water response to climatic forcing\\nThe coastal catchments of NW Scotland are often the first areas of the UK mainland\\nto receive weather systems from the North Atlantic, hence along with the high relief\\nof the land promoting orographic rainfall, these catchments fall into high annual\\nprecipitation bands (table 2.1; Gillibrand et al., 2005). Inter-annual variability in the\\nlocation of the North Atlantic storm track due to the NAO strongly influences the\\nwind patterns and precipitation received by NW European coastal locations (section\\n1.3). Since DWREs appear to respond to coupled wind direction, wind strength and\\n37\\nChapter 2 Study area, materials and methods\\nrunoff forcing (Gillibrand et al., 1995), Loch Sunart circulation was expected to show\\na response to the regional climatic forcing of the NAO. Gillibrand et al., (2005)\\nmodelled the response of main basin and inner basin circulation to extreme NAO\\nforcing (section 1.8.3. and chapter 3) and showed that Loch Sunart main basin salinity\\nshowed a negligible change whilst the inner basin showed a clear response, with\\nfrequent basin exchange (thus higher salinity basin water) occurring during negative\\nNAO years and less frequent DWREs during the positive NAO state. The\\nimplications of this hydrographic response are of great importance to the Scottish\\nfisheries industry, since many fish farms are located in NW Scottish sea lochs and an\\nextended period of the positive NAO phase and response to anthropogenic forcing\\n(section 1.3) may result in basin water stagnation, oxygen depletion and other factors\\nassociated with infrequent flushing such as nutrient enrichment (e.g. Gillibrand et al.,\\n1996; Gillibrand &Turrell, 1997).\\n2.1.6 Coastal hydrography\\nThe hydrography of the Scottish shelf and slope region is complex and has been\\ndocumented by Craig (1953), Ellett (1979), Ellett & Edwards (1983), Simpson &\\nRippeth (1993), Hill et al., (1997), Thomason et al., (1997), Xing & Davies (2001),\\nHolliday (2003), Inall & Griffiths (2003) and Kershaw et al., (2004). The North\\nAtlantic Current (NAC) typically follows the bathymetry of the Hebridean slope\\n(figure 2.7) and incursions of saline North Atlantic water flow onto the shelf north of\\nIreland as the N. Atlantic Slope Current (NASC), mixing with the Scottish Coastal\\nCurrent (SCC; Ellett, 1979), and are thought to be an important component of water\\nwithin, for example, the Tiree Passage (McKay et al., 1986; Inall & Griffiths, 2003).\\nAdditionally, a small branch of highly saline water (> 35) of Atlantic origin is present\\nin the deep (>100 m) waters west of Tiree (Hill et al., 1997) and the well defined\\n\\'Islay front\\' (an area of typically high productivity, where the stratified water mass of\\nthe outer Hebridean shelf meets the mixed inner shelf water mass) exists to the south¬\\nwest of Tiree (Ellett, 1979; Simpson et al., 1979).\\nInner shelf bottom waters (influenced by the SCC) are typically warmer and less\\nsaline than outer shelf bottom waters (Craig, 1958; Ellett, 1979) and though seasonal\\nstratification is common in shelf seas (e.g. Simpson & Hunter, 1974; Pingree &\\n38\\nChapter 2 Study area, materials and methods\\nFigure 2.7 Schematic of surface ocean currents to the west of Scotland and Ireland. Also shown\\nis the simplified bathymetry of the area and geographical regions. Loch Sunart is highlighted by\\na rectangle. Figure re-drawn after Ellet& Blindheim (1992).\\n39\\nChapter 2 Study area, materials and methods\\nGriffiths, 1978; Simpson & Rippeth, 1993; Backhaus, 1996; Scourse & Austin, 2002;\\nScourse et al., 2002; Scourse et al., 2004) many Inner Hebridean locations often\\nexhibit mixed water columns (Craig, 1958; McKay et al., 1986) due to high tidal\\ncurrents and rough seabed topography (Ellett & Edwards, 1983). Such a region of\\nmixing is located just outside the mouth of Loch Sunart (McKay et al., 1986).\\nDespite this tendency towards a well-mixed water column, Hebridean shelf bottom\\nwaters show a classical \\'lagged\\' response to the seasonal heating cycle (figure 2.8).\\nSurface waters display a temperature cycle largely in phase with air temperatures, thus\\nexemplifying a strong ocean-atmosphere coupling (e.g. Czaja et al., 2003). Bottom\\nwater temperatures (BWT) tend to lag behind air temperatures e.g. maximum BWT\\noccur around November (figure 2.8), only after winter winds mix the heated surface\\nlayer down through the water column\\n2.1.7 Oceanograpliic response to climate forcing\\nThe ocean-atmosphere coupling and inter-annual variability over the surface NE\\nAtlantic appears to be both complex and poorly understood. However, inter-annual\\nvariability in the NE Atlantic Ocean surface currents appear to be strongly linked with\\nclimatic forcing mechanisms such as those modulated by the NAO (e.g. Dickson et\\nal., 1988; Dickson et al., 1996; Belkin et al., 1998; Blindheim et al., 2000; Holliday,\\n2003; Belkin, 2004).\\nFor example; during strongly positive NAO years, the NASC pervading the slope\\nnorth of Ireland is likely to be of Eastern North Atlantic Central Water (ENAW)\\norigin, i.e. warm and saline (Holliday, 2003), whereas during negative NAO years the\\nwater in the Rockall Trough often consists of ENAW, together with the cooler and\\nfresher waters of the Sub-Arctic Intermediate Water (SIAW) and the Western North\\nAtlantic Central Water (WNAW; Holliday, 2003). During a positive NAO phase,\\nmixing of the saline NASC water with the SCC (which may be stronger during NAO\\npositive winters; Kershaw et al., 2004) at the mouth of Loch Sunart (Craig, 1958;\\nEllett & Edwards, 1983) is likely to result in the coastal bottom waters entering Loch\\nSunart being more saline in comparison to NAO negative years, even when modified\\nby regional processes such as seasonal heating and freshwater runoff (Ellett &\\n40\\nFigure 2.8 Annual temperature cycles taken during 1973-77 from 4 depths\\non the Hebridean Shelf,west of Barra Head (56°52\\'N,8°22\\'W). Re-drawn\\nand modified from Ellet (1979).\\n41\\nChapter 2 Study area, materials and methods\\nEdwards, 1983). The NAO is a winter phenomenon (Jones et al., 1997) and whilst the\\ndeep or intermediate ocean is likely to demonstrate a 2-4 year lagged response to the\\nNAO (Holliday, 2003), the response of surface waters may be much faster. Gillibrand\\net al., (2005) showed (via sensitivity analyses) that variations in coastal salinity\\nbetween 34-34.6 for water depths below 30 m were communicated to both main and\\ninner basin water of Loch Sunart during circulation modelling for extreme NAO\\nyears.\\n2.2 Cruises and Fieldwork\\nHydrographic data and sample material were collected through participation on a\\nseries of research cruises (see table 2.2). All oceanographic positions on the cruises\\nwere obtained using Global Positioning Systems (GPS), and are reported as decimal\\nlatitudes and longitudes, i.e. in degrees and decimal minutes N/W. Ordnance Survey\\n(OS) reference points are given for the weather station positions.

Calanus (Dunstaffnage Marine Laboratories).\\nA Sholkovitch coring device was used to obtain short cores up to 70 cm in length on\\nthe April 2001 R.V. Clupea cruise. This type of corer is used when an undisturbed\\nshort sediment core containing the sediment water interface is required. Due to\\ndemands on the equipment and the high water content of the sediment, the\\nSholkovitch cores were extruded and sliced at 0.5 cm, 1cm and 2cm intervals whilst\\nonboard R.V. Clupea by A. G. Cage (AGC), William Austin (WENA) and Niels\\nNorgaard-Pedersen (NNP), stored in plastic bags and refrigerated. Radiocarbon\\ndating was carried out on marine molluscs from the base of each core to provide a\\nreconnaissance age and information on gross accumulation rates before the long cores\\nwere obtained.\\n42\\nTable2.2Researchcruis sinLochSun rt.

Calanus using a British Geological Survey (BGS) 3 m\\ncylindrical gravity corer (with PVC liner), approximately 8.4 cm in diameter. Gravity\\ncores are commonly used for obtaining continuous cores, particularly from soft\\nsediments, however this method of coring often results in the \\'shortening\\' of the\\nsediment stratigraphy leading to \\'undersampling\\' of the sedimentary archive (Skinner\\n& McCave, 2003). Two sediment cores were taken at each coring site: the gravity\\ncore was used to obtain sediment cores up to 3 m in length and a short Sholkovitch\\ncore to capture the sediment water interface which is often \\'lost\\' during gravity\\ncoring. The gravity cores were logged by Dr. J. Howe and NNP, and stored at 4 °C at\\nthe Dunstaffnage Marine Laboratory.\\nGravity core GC023 (core length 2.89 m) was recovered from the Dun Ghallain Deep,\\nin the main basin of Loch Sunart, (56.6670 ° N, -5.8388 ° W, in decimal degrees;\\nwater depth = 120 m; figure 2.9) and was the core selected for palaeoenvironmental\\nstudy due to a high sediment accumulation rate over the last 2000 years (chapter 8).\\nAn accompanying Sholkovitch core SC023 (core length of 0.74 m) was also recovered\\nnearby (56.6659 °N, -5.8404 °W; approximate distance from GC023 = 138 m).\\nSubsequent geochemical data (see chapter 8) from the two cores confirms that they\\ncan be correlated together, despite being from slightly different positions. The\\nworking half of core GC023 and the extruded sliced intervals from SC023 were\\ntransported to the School of Geography & Geosciences (University of St Andrews),\\nwhereupon GC023 was re-logged and sampled at continuous 1 cm intervals for\\nanalyses. All samples were stored at 4°C, and the gravity core material was covered in\\ncling-film to prevent the core material from drying out. Storing samples at low\\ntemperatures is vital, since bacteria contained in sediments can break-down organic\\nmatter at high (e.g. room) temperatures.\\n2.3.2 Surface sediment samples\\nThirty-one surface sediment samples were taken from Loch Sunart for benthic\\nforaminiferal analyses and sedimentological analyses (see figure 2.9). The samples\\nwere obtained using either a Van Veen grab sampler or a Craib corer (used solely on\\nthe April 2001 R.V. Clupea cruise).

Unfortunately, the\\nCraib corer was not available for all cruises and was not suitable for all sites; therefore\\nthe grab sampler was the main method used to obtain surface samples, particularly\\ncoarser sediments.\\nOn recovery, the top 1-2 cm of sediment was scraped off into a container and\\npreserved for subsequent foraminiferal analysis (see section 2.6). The remainder of\\nthe sediment was archived in refrigerated (4 °C) or frozen (-20 °C) conditions to be\\nused for grain size, C/N and loss-on-ignition analyses.\\n2.3.3 CTD measurements\\nCTD (conductivity, temperature and depth) measurements were carried out during the\\nR.V. Clupea April 2001 cruise, the R.V. Envoy June 2001 cruise and the R.V. Envoy\\nJune 2002 cruise.\\nOn the R.V. Clupea 2001 cruise, a CTD cast was taken using a CTD maintained and\\ncalibrated by FRS Aberdeen at every coring site. CTD casts using a STD Plus 646\\ninstrument with SmallTalk 2.00 software (procured by the School of Geography &\\nGeosciences in 2002) were taken at the majority of the sediment sampling sites during\\nthe 2002 and 2003 cruise on R.V. Envoy.\\nData from the CTD was downloaded using SmallTalk 2.00 software and put into\\nExcel spreadsheets. The bottom water temperatures and salinities (determined using\\nthe conductivity data) weie lead off the cast data for use in isotopic studies and faunal\\nassemblage work. CTD casts were also taken to calibrate the stationary moorings (see\\nsection 2.4.1). Full CTD data are presented in appendix 2.\\n46\\nChapter 2 Study area, materials and methods\\n2.4 Observational instruments\\n2.4.1 Stationary hydrographic mooring\\nTo gain an understanding of the seasonal hydrographic changes in Loch Sunart, two\\nstationary Anderaa RCM-7 current meters complete with temperature and\\nconductivity sensors and a data logger (figure 2.10) were deployed in the inner basin\\n(56.6842 dec. ° N, -5.6211 dec. °W) between 27th June 2001 and the 18th June 2002,\\nand the main basin (56.6660 °N, -5.8434 °W) between 7th April, 2001 until the 17lh\\nJune 2002. These stationary moorings were suspended approximately 40 m above the\\nsea bed by a configuration of buoys (fig 2.11), well below the influence of the\\nbrackish surface layer (Gillibrand et al., 1995). A series of independent CTD casts\\nwere taken to calibrate the mooring instruments throughout the deployment. These\\ncasts are important, since instruments left in the marine environment for a long period\\nof time often become \\'fouled\\' (i.e. overgrown with weeds and other marine life), and\\nthis inhibits conductivity readings causing the instrument to \\'drift\\' i.e. salinity\\nprogressively decreases. Unfortunately, the current meters quickly became \\'fouled\\'\\n(figure 2.10) thus no current data is available. Upon recovery of the moorings, the\\ninstruments were taken to FRS Aberdeen where Dr P. Gillibrand downloaded the data\\ninto Excel files, visually checked the data and corrected the data for instrumental\\n\\'drift\\'. Data presented in appendix 3.\\n2.4.2 Weather station\\n2.4.2.1 Site location\\nThe weather station was placed in a field (owned by Mr. & Mrs. Campbell, Ariundle\\nCentre) in Aruindle, approximately 2 km north of Strontian (Ordnance Survey\\nreference NM822633, figure 2.12). The field offered a secure, accessible site which\\nwas within the River Strontian catchment area and which was \\'open\\', i.e. not sheltered\\nby trees or buildings and unaffected by varying environmental conditions such as the\\n\\'clothesline\\', \\'leading edge\\' and \\'oasis\\' effect (figure 2.13; Campbell Scientific\\ntechnical manual, 1999).\\n47\\nChapter 2 Study area, materials and methods\\nFigure 2.10 A) Anderaa RCM-7 mooring deployed in Loch Sunart\\'s inner and main basin, loaned\\nfrom and calibrated by Fisheries Research Services, Aberdeen.

Data\\nfrom the 14th August, 2001 to the 4th September, 2003 was collected using the\\nCampbell Scientific \\'Basic Weather Station\\' (see figure 2.13). The weather station\\nwas powered by a battery recharged by the SOP5 Solar Panel and comprised of: a 50Y\\ntemperature and relative humidity probe contained within a T351-RS Solar radiation\\nshield; a 03001-5 wind sentry collecting wind speed and direction data, and a CR510\\ndata logger. A Young Tipping Bucket Rain Gauge (model 52203 - unheated) was\\nused to collect precipitation data (see appendix 4 for specifications). The prevailing\\nlocal weather is funneled up from the mouth of the loch towards the head (Gillibrand\\net al., 1995) and up the Strontian valley (pers. comm., Mr. Campbell, 2001), therefore\\nthe rain gauge was placed 3 m upwind from the weather station to ensure a rain\\nshadow effect did not influence the precipitation collection. Data from the weather\\nstation was downloaded approximately every 4 months using the PC200W software\\n(Campbell Scientific, 1999) and imported into an Excel spreadsheet. Data presented\\nin appendix 5.\\n2.4.2.3 Data validation\\nThe Ariundle weather station data was validated against data taken from a Scottish\\nEnvironmental Protection Agency (SEPA) weather station situated in the Polloch\\ncatchment (Ordnance Survey reference NM795687; figure 2.12).\\n50\\nChapter 2 Study area, materials and methods\\n2.5 Laboratory Methods\\n2.5.1 Bulk sediment geochemical analyses\\nHigh-resolution geochemical data for selected elements (see chapter 8) were obtained\\nfor core GC023 using the X-Ray fluorescence spectroscopy (XRF) core scanner at\\nBremen University. This research was carried out by WENA and NNP via an EU\\nPALEOSTUDIES award granted to WENA and NNP. Low-resolution geochemical\\ndata was obtained for core GC023 via X-Ray diffraction (XRD) methods on discrete\\nsamples. The work was carried out by NNP at the School of Geography &\\nGeosciences, University of St Andrews.\\n2.5.2 Wet/Dry bulk densities and water content\\nThe working half of core GC023 was sub-sampled for the determination of sediment\\nbulk density. These data were also required to adjust magnetic susceptibility data\\n(Dearing, 1998).\\nSediment was extracted from a core interval and placed in a pre-weighed plastic pot of\\na known volume. Wet bulk density was determined via the following equation;\\nDensitywet (g.cm\" ) = weight of wet sample / volume of sample (Eq. 2.1)\\nFollowing the determination of wet bulk density, the sample pots containing the\\nsediment were dried in an oven at 105 °C for at least 24 hours. Once they had cooled\\n(in a dessicator), the dried samples were weighed and the following equation was used\\nto calculate the dry bulk density;\\nDensitydry (g.cm\"3) = weight of dry sample/ volume of sample (F.q. 2 2)\\nThe water content of the sediment sample was calculated via;\\nWater content (%) = wet weight - dry weight of sample / wet weight of sample * 100\\n(Eq. 2.3)\\n51\\nChapter 2 Study area, materials and methods\\n2.5.3 Grain size analysis\\nGrain size analyses were carried out using the Coulter LS230 Particle Size Machine at\\nthe School of Geography & Geosciences, University of St Andrews using raw (i.e.\\nuntreated samples) and digested samples (i.e. organic fraction and calcium carbonate\\nremoved, see appendix 6 for procedures). Approximately lg of sediment was sub-\\nsampled from surface sediment samples and core samples. A paste was formed (using\\ndistilled water) and this was added to the machine until the obscurity reading reached\\n14 %. Three runs were carried out on each sample. The software ran statistical\\nanalyses for the mode, median and mean of the measurements and these data were put\\ninto Excel spreadsheets.\\n2.5.4 % Organic matter (% LOI550)\\nThe loss on ignition (LOI) technique can be used to determine the % organic matter in\\na sediment sample. Organic matter combusts at temperatures of 500-550 °C leaving\\nash and C02. The weight lost in a sample during this combustion procedure is\\nroughly equal to the percentage of organic matter in the sample. Heiri et al., (2000)\\nprovide a review of the LOI process.\\nA crucible was labelled and weighed (after drying at 105 °C for one hour) and\\napproximately 5g of sub-sampled sediment (which had been stored in refrigerated\\nconditions) was added to the crucible. The crucible containing the sample was then\\ndried at 105 °C overnight and weighed again once cool. The samples were then\\ncombusted at 550 °C in a muffle furnace for 4 hours, after which they were placed in a\\ndessicator to cool, and subsequently weighed.\\nThe % organic matter (i.e. the % LOI550) contained within the sample and expressed\\nas a % of dry sediment weight can be calculated by:\\n% organic matter = ((W 105 - W 550) / W 105 ) * 100 % (Eq. 2.4)\\nwhere W 105 = sample weight after drying at 105 °C\\nW 550 = sample weight after combustion at 550 °C\\n52\\nChapter 2 Study area, materials and methods\\n2.5.5 % Calcium carbonate (% LOI950)\\nSequential LOI can also be used as a crude method of determining the % of calcium\\ncarbonate (CaCOa) in a sample. The LOI550 sample is returned to the muffle furnace\\n(after the final LOI550 weigh) and combusted at 950 °C for 1 hour, whereupon CO?\\nevolves from the CaC03 leaving oxide. The LOI950 sample is then removed from the\\noven, placed in a dessicator to cool and weighed. The % CaCOs can be calculated by;\\n% CaC03 = [((W550 - W950) / W105) * 100] * 1.36 (Eq. 2.5)\\nwhere W 950 = sample weight after combustion at 950 °C\\n1.36 is a multiplying factor to approximate the original weight of carbonate in\\nthe sample (Bengtsson & Enell, 1986 cited by Heiri et al, 2001).\\n2.5.6 C/N ratios\\n2.5.6.1 Surface sediment sample C/N ratios\\nApproximately 100 mg of homogenised sample was placed in a small plastic test-tube\\n(with lid) and weighed on a Mettler AT21 microbalance. A few drops of concentrated\\nHCL (1%) was added to the sample in order to remove carbonate, and the sample was\\nagitated to aid the reaction. Further drops of concentrated HCL were carefully added\\nto the sample, ensuring no material was lost, until there was no further reaction to the\\nacid. Distilled water was added to the tube to remove salt-ions from the reaction and\\nthe mixture was centrifuged for approximately 3 minutes. The solution was carefully\\nremoved using a pipette (ensuring no sample material was lost). This rinsing\\nprocedure (i.e. adding distilled water and centrifuging) was carried out 3 times. After\\nthe final rinse, the solution was removed from the test tube, which was then placed in\\na 50 °C drying oven overnight. The tube was placed in a dessicator to cool and then\\nweighed. The above procedures were performed by AGC at the Sedimentology\\nLaboratory, Department of Earth Sciences, University of Bergen, following their\\nmethodology (http://his.geol.uib.no/hovedlab/instrument fisons cookbook eng.html).\\nA Fisons EA1108-CHNS-O (accuracy ± 0.3 %) analyzer (see\\nhttp://his.geol.uib.no/hovedlab/instrument fisons start eng.html for details on the\\ninstrument) was used for the C/N analyses. All C/N analyses were carried out by Stig\\n53\\nChapter 2 Study area, materials and methods\\nMonsen, at the Sedimentology Laboratory, Department of Earth Sciences, University\\nof Bergen, through the Marie Curie Training Site pre-doctoral fellowship funding\\nawarded to AGC.\\n2.5.6.2 Core GC023 C/N ratios\\nPreparation of samples for C/N analyses from core GC023 were carried out by NNP\\n(at the University of St Andrews), following the procedure outlined in King et al.,\\n1998. Samples were dried at approximately 40 °C (higher temperatures can cause the\\nbreakdown of organic matter in the sediment) for approximately 2 days and\\nhomogenised using a Fritsch ball mill. Approximately 30 mg of homogenised\\nsediment was accurately weighed out into pre-combusted tin capsules, and samples\\nwere carefully acidified with 100 |il aliquots of 2M HC1 until all inorganic carbon has\\nbeen fully decomposed. This is essential since the determination of organic carbon is\\ndependent on the organic carbon being totally separated from the inorganic carbon\\n(Verardo et al., 1990), and inorganic carbon remaining in the sample would result in\\nthe carbon content being overestimated (King et al., 1998). Samples were dried at 40\\n°C for ~3 days to ensure no moisture remained in the samples, then carefully formed\\ninto small balls and analysed by Mr. Tim Brand at the Dunstaffnage Marine\\nLaboratories.\\n2.6 Benthic Foraminifera\\nForaminifera are microscopic, eukaryotic, single-celled marine protozoa belonging to\\nthe Kingdom Protoctista, Phylum Granulorecticulosa, Class Foraminifera (Sen Gupta,\\n1999). Planktonic foraminfera live suspended within the photic zone of the water\\ncolumn, however these forms rarely inhabit coastal waters (Murray, 1991b).\\nConversely, benthic foraminifera (which live on or in the sea-floor sediment) are\\nubiquitous in distribution, allowing ecological studies to be carried out throughout a\\nbroad range of marine environments (Murray, 1973a).\\nThe CaC03 tests of benthic foraminifera are generally well preserved and benthic\\nforaminifera have two key proxy pathways with respect to environmental parameters;\\n54\\nChapter 2 Study area, materials and methods\\nthe biological pathway where there is a covariation between the abundance of\\nindividuals/assemblage composition or the chemical pathway where elements are\\nincorporated into the shell material (Murray, 2001). This allows transfer functions\\n(using modern analogues) to be applied to fossil records and provides a basis for\\nchemical analyses, such as stable isotope work, AMS radiocarbon dating and trace\\nelement geochemistry, all of which provide vital palaeoclimate and\\npalaeoceanographic information. Hence their ubiquity, abundance, species diversity\\nand preservation in marine sediments make them the most widely studied marine\\nmicrofossils.\\nThese marine protozoa are characterised by a simple or multi-chambered test which is\\ncomposed of either calcite (rare aragonite forms exist) or agglutinated material\\ncemented with an organic or inorganic substance (Haynes, 1981). Some, so-called\\nnaked species possess an organic (or tectin) test (e.g. Gooday, 2002), though these\\nwall types are rarely preserved in sedimentary archives. The organic soft tissue of\\nforaminifera consists of protoplasm and performs many functions. For example,\\nprotoplasm containing the nucleus, mitochondria (respiration and energy cells) and\\nribosomes (protein synthesisers) is contained within and protected by the test\\n(endoplasm). Most of the interchange between benthic foraminifera and their\\nenvironment occurs across the ectoplasm (protoplasm outwith the test walls), which\\nalso maintains the secretion of the test and the ectoplasm pseudopodia also capture\\nfood and maintain motility. Since fossil benthic foraminifera are primarily used as\\npalaeoproxies in this study, the biology of living foraminifera will not be covered in\\nany great detail here, however Boltovskoy & Wright (1976), Haynes (1981) and Lee,\\n& Anderson (1991) provide useful reviews.\\nThe complex reproduction cycles of benthic foraminifera, often alternating between\\nasexual and sexual reproduction (see Lee et al., 1991), may be influenced by physio-\\nchemical factors such as bottom water temperature or by food availability arising from\\nphytoplankton blooms (e.g. Gooday, 1988; Gooday & Rathburn, 1999; Gustafsson &\\nNordberg, 2001). Species do not necessarily reproduce and calcify at the same time\\nthroughout the year, as demonstrated by the \\'seasonality effect\\' of Scourse et al.,\\n(2004), thus the population structure of the community varies throughout the year (e.g.\\nMurray, 1983) and may vary from year to year.\\n55\\nChapter 2 Study area, materials and methods\\n2.6.1. Living habitats of benthic foraminifera\\nBenthic foraminiferal species maintain living habitats either upon the sea floor\\nsediment (epifaunal) or within the surface sediment (infaunal) and test morphology\\ncan often be indicative of microhabitat e.g. Corliss, (1985); Buzas et al., (1993).\\nEpifaunal specimens may live on the sediment surface (epibenthic), on plants\\n(epiphytic) or cling to large sediment grains and rocks (epilithic). Infaunal species\\nlive at different depths within the sediment in response to food and oxygen\\navailability, as conceptualised by the \\'TROX\\' model of Jorissen et al., (1995) and\\nJorissen (1999).\\nThe growth (or ontogeny) of benthic foraminifera is typically fast but then slows as\\nindividuals mature and can be influenced by biotic factors such as food availability or\\nphysical factors such as temperature and salinity (e.g. Boltovskoy & Wright, 1976;\\nWefer, 1976; Murray, 1991a). For example, species typically have an optimum,\\nmaximum and minimum temperature for survival (Murray, 1973a; Boltovskoy &\\nWright, 1976) and a preference for certain salinity conditions.\\nFor instance, restricted basins with low salinity basin waters often show a bias towards\\nagglutinated taxa (e.g. Murray, 1973b; Bronnimann & Whittaker, 1988b; Bronnimann\\n& Whittaker, 1990; Alve, 1995; Murray & Alve, 1999; Murray et al., 2003). Hyaline\\ntaxa from such stressed and low salinity environments often have thin and etched tests\\ndue to low pH or problems with carbonate availability (Murray, 1973a); either process\\ncreates a stressful environment for calcareous taxa, which must spend \\'considerable\\nenergy recalcifying their tests\\' (Boltovskoy & Wright, 1976). Hyaline taxa inhabiting\\nlow salinity waters demonstrate an efficient use of available CaCC>3 during test\\nformation (using an organic membrane template) whereas miliolina taxa use a less\\norganised method which requires readily available CaCCF (Boltovskoy & Wright,\\n1976) and are unable to maintain pseudopodial reticulum activity in hyposaline waters\\n(Murray, 1973a; Haynes, 1981).\\n56\\nChapter 2 Study area, materials and methods\\n2.6.2 Utilising benthic foraminifera as environmental and palaeoenvironmental\\nproxies\\nAs mentioned previously, the ubiquitous distribution of benthic foraminifera in marine\\nenvironments together with their sensitivity to changes in living habitat, good\\npreservation in most marine sediments and the range of applications based on their\\nshell geochemistry (e.g. stable isotopes) makes these marine organisms extremely\\nuseful proxies for studying environmental or palaeoenvironmental change. Before\\nutilising proxies in palaeoenvironmental reconstructions, it is important to understand\\nhow fossil benthic foraminiferal assemblages are influenced by environmental\\nparameters. To do this, we must first ascertain how modern benthic foraminiferal\\nassemblages (a statistical representation of the population) respond to abiotic\\nparameters such as hydrography (e.g. temperature, salinity, currents, oxygen\\navailability) and substrate, as well as to biotic factors such as food availability and\\ninputs of organic matter. These relationships, along with measures of species\\ndiversity, abundance and wall types (Murray, 1973a, 1991b) can be used to facilitate\\nthe recognition of benthic foraminiferal assemblages characteristic of certain\\necological environments.\\n2.6.2.1 Sample collection\\nThe top 1-2 cm of surface sediment was collected from surface sediment grab samples\\n(section 2.3.2) and placed in a plastic container. The thickness of sample collected\\nwas largely determined by the oxygen penetration depth or grain size. Where\\nsediment was coarse (e.g. sand) a thicker portion of sediment was retained for\\nforaminiferal analysis since coarser sediments tend to have low foraminifera numbers\\nand deeper oxygen penetration depths. Fine grained sediments have a propensity for\\nhigher foraminifera numbers and at these locations a 1 cm scrape was taken.\\nHowever, some sample sites yielded fine grained \\'smelly\\' sediments (i.e. high in\\norganic matter and H2S) with a thin oxidised layer, thus a thin surface scrape was\\nobtained in order to avoid collecting sediments which were unlikely to have \\'live\\'\\nforaminifera within them.\\nA mixture of ethanol and rose Bengal was added to preserve and stain \\'live\\' organic\\ntissue contained within the sediment (after Walton, 1952; see Boltovskoy & Wright,\\n57\\nChapter 2 Study area, materials and methods\\n1976 for technique). Samples were sieved on return from the field season\\n(approximately 1-2 weeks) hence allowing the stain ample time to \\'fix\\'. Specimens\\nwere considered \\'live\\' when at least one chamber was stained bright pink by rose\\nBengal, however live populations are often over-estimated when using rose Bengal as\\nthe protoplasm of recently deceased foraminifera (up to 3 months) can also take up the\\nstain (e.g. Bernhard, 2000). However, given the practicality (i.e. speed and cost) of\\nusing rose Bengal (Murray & Bowser, 2000), this stain was used in the present study.\\nThough cores GC023 and SC023 were sub-sampled every 1cm for benthic\\nforaminiferal analysis, only low resolution assemblage analyses were carried out.\\n2.6.2.2 Preparation ofresidue forforaminiferal analysis\\nIn the laboratory, samples were wet-sieved using a 63 pm mesh size sieve and a fine\\nwater spray. Samples were sieved until the effluent water ran clear (i.e. no mud\\npresent), and given the fine-grain size and high organic matter content of these\\nsediments, each sample took on average approximately 2 hours to sieve. Bounded\\nsamples, i.e. those with a high % of clay, or compacted sediments from the gravity\\ncore, were soaked overnight in sodium hexametaphosphate to encourage\\ndisaggregation. The sieve was thoroughly washed in between samples and submerged\\nin methyl blue solution, which stains calcium carbonate thus allowing contaminant\\nforaminifera specimens to be identified in a sample. The sieved samples were rinsed\\nwith distilled water and left to dry at 40 °C. The drying temperature is kept fairly low,\\nsince drying at high temperatures can damage foraminiferal tests and may alter the\\nshell geochemistry.\\n2.6.2.3 Foraminiferal analysis\\nA weight for the total sieved sample was determined and the 125 pm - 500 pm\\nfraction (or residue) was obtained (using sieving methods) for use in foraminiferal\\nanalysis. This weighed fraction was divided using a splitter to yield unbiased sub-\\nsample splits from which a sufficient number of specimens could be obtained. A\\nZeiss Stemi SV11 stereo microscope was used to pick and identify the foraminifera.\\nThe sub-sample split was spread evenly over a brass picking tray and over 300 benthic\\n58\\nChapter 2 Study area, materials and methods\\nforaminifera were picked using an artists (grade 0000) paintbrush. Statistical studies\\nshow that over 300 specimens are required to ensure that assemblages are\\nrepresentative of the whole sample (e.g. Dennison & Hay, 1967 as cited by\\nBoltovskoy & Wright, 1976 and Buzas, 1990). Specimens were picked from each\\nsquare of the entire split (preferred method), or from random squares (to avoid biasing\\ntowards a certain size of specimen) if the number of foraminifera in a sub-sample split\\nwere particularly high. Every specimen within a square was picked before moving\\nonto the next square to avoid biasing results towards larger, more visible individuals.\\nBenthic foraminifera were identified to species level using the taxonomy of Loeblich\\n& Tappan (1987) and archived in slides. Reference materials used for identifying the\\nbenthic foraminifera were Hoglund (1947), Feyling-Hanssen et al., (1971), Murray\\n(1971, 1979), Haynes (1973), Bronnimann & Whittaker (1988) and Austin (1991).\\nFew planktonic foraminifera were found in the samples, thus planktonic specimens\\nwere not identified to species level.\\n2.6.3 Benthic foraminiferal transfer functions\\nBirks (1995) provides an excellent review of the theory and practice of ecological\\ncalibration, thus the basic principles are outlined here and illustrated in figure 2.14.\\nFossil assemblages (Y0) such as fossil benthic foraminiferal assemblages consisting of\\nm taxa and t samples, can provide important palaeoenvironmental information on, for\\nexample, a variable such as past summer bottom water temperature (Xo). To estimate\\nXo, the biological response of a suite of modern assemblages (Y), known as a \\'training\\nset\\' and consisting of m taxa and n samples, to the modern environmental variable (X)\\ncan be modelled numerically. The resulting transfer function is applied to the fossil\\ndata (Yo) to provide a quantitative estimate of the past environmental variable Xo).\\nFive major assumptions are made when using quantitative palaeoenvironmental\\nreconstructions (taken from Birks, 2003);\\n1. Taxa in the training set (Y) must be systematically related to the environment\\nin which they live (X).\\n59\\nChapter 2 Study area, materials and methods\\nModern data\\n\\'training set\\'\\nBIOLOGICAL DATA\\n(e.g. benthic foraminifera)\\n1 .m, taxa\\nENVIRONMENTAL DATA\\n(e.g. summer bottom water temperature)\\n1 variable\\nn\\nsamples\\nn\\nsamples\\nFossil data 1 .m, taxa 1 variable\\nXo Unknown\\nTo be reconstructed\\nsamples samples\\nFigure 2.14 The principles of quantitative palaeoenvironmental reconstruction showing X0,the\\nunknown environment variable (e.g. summer bottom water temperature) to be reconstructed\\nfrom fossil assemblages Yo, and the essential role of a modern training set consisting of modern\\nbiological (Y) and environmental (X) data.

The environmental variable to be reconstructed is, or is linearly related to, an\\necologically important determinant of the system.\\n3.

The modelled response of modern Y to X\\nover an environmental gradient (created using spatially distributed samples)\\ncan be used to reconstruct Xo.\\n4. Mathematical methods should adequately model the biological response of Y\\nto X and yield transfer functions with sufficient predictive power to allow\\naccurate an unbiased reconstructions of X.\\n5. Other environmental variables, other than X, should have negligible influence\\non the biological response or should maintain a joint relationship on taxa\\ndistribution over time.\\nOther requirements state that: fossils must be easily identifiable and well preserved\\n(e.g. benthic foraminifera); fossil data sets should be of comparable taxonomy, quality\\nand sedimentary environment as the training set (e.g. shelf seas); a good independent\\nchronology (e.g. radiocarbon dating) is required for fossil data sets to allow\\ncorrelations with other proxy records; the training set should be of high quality\\n(ideally > 200 n samples) and from the same sedimentary environment (shelf seas),\\nrepresenting the likely range of variables experienced by Yo; mathematical models\\nshould be robust, theorectically sound both ecologically and statistically, critically\\nevaluated and validated and accompanied by sample-specific prediction errors (Birks,\\n1995).\\n2.6.3.1 Software\\nThe transfer function work was carried out using the software C2 (Juggins, 2003a).\\nC2 is a Microsoft Windows programme for analysing and visualising\\npalaeoenvionmental data sets and multi-proxy stratigraphic data sets.

Sejrup (Sejrup et\\nal., 2004) and access was granted to this data as part of the pre-doctoral fellowship\\nawarded to AGC at the Marie Curie Training Site scheme, University of Bergen. A\\nfull description of the transfer function can be found in Sejrup et al., (2004) and the\\ntransfer function is discussed further in chapter 7.\\nThe database includes 298 samples from the NW European continental margin and\\nshelf, spanning from Svalbard to the west coast of Ireland. Sejrup et al., (2004) did\\nnot include samples from fjordic environments since these environments tend to\\nundergo greater seasonal change than \\'open\\' shelf environments ipers comm., Dr. D.\\nKlitgaard-Kristensen, 2003). However, to extend the environmental gradient of the\\nhydrographic data, and also to add samples similar to the core site, modern Loch\\nSunart samples were added to the training set (RBF database) following the rules set\\nout in Sejrup et al., (2004), i.e:\\n1. Only samples from water depths between 50 m and 500 m are included.\\n2. Samples where \\'% Other species\\' exceeds 10% were excluded.\\n3. Species chosen for inclusion in the training set were the species which\\nfrequently constituted to more than 90% of any assemblage.\\nUnfortunately many of the modern (i.e. surface sediment) benthic foraminifera\\nsamples from Loch Sunart could not be included due to the above \\'rules\\', however 3\\nsamples were included (22, 80 and 198). Also, differences in common species\\nbetween the RBF samples and the Loch Sunart samples were evident, probably due to\\ngeographical differences in temperature and salinities. These issues are discussed in\\nfurther detail in chapter 7.\\n62\\nChapter 2 Study area, materials and methods\\n2.6.4 Stable isotopic compositions in benthic foraminifera\\nThe stable isotopic composition of benthic foraminifera tests are influenced by\\nenvironmental variables such as temperature, salinity and nutrient availability, often\\nreflecting the properties of the water mass in which they live (Rohling & Cooke,\\n1999).\\n2.6.4.1 Stable isotopes from modern benthic foraminifera\\nStable oxygen and carbon isotopic analyses were carried out on four benthic\\nforaminifera species: Ammonia beccarii, Cibicides lobatulus, Bulimina marginata and\\nNonionella turgida. Where possible \\'live\\' specimens were preferentially selected (in\\nthe modern study), and where dead or fossil foraminifera were used, only pristine\\nspecimens with no visible sign of dissolution or diagenesis were selected. All\\nspecimens were selected from the 125-250 pm size fraction.\\nThe appropriate number of benthic foraminifera were picked (using a metal pin) to\\nattain the required weight for the mass spectrometer used (-0.2 mg) . This varied\\ndepending on the system requirements and the species used. The isotope sample was\\nweighed and transferred to a small isotope vial, where the foraminifera were gently\\ncrushed using a glass rod, and a few drops of methanol were added. The sample was\\nthen cleaned via an ultrasonic bath for 1 minute, after which the remaining methanol\\nwas carefully decanted using a pipette, ensuring no material was lost. The samples\\nwere then placed in a 40 °C oven overnight to dry. After the tops of the glass vials\\nwere carefully checked and cleaned for dust, the samples were loaded onto the\\nautosampler of the Kiel Device.\\nIsotopic analyses were carried out using three different mass spectrometers:\\n1. A Finnigan MAT 251 with Kiel device at Bremen University (funded through\\nan EU PALEOSTUDIES award granted to WENA and NNP), which had mean\\nerrors (shown with standard deviations of 0.035 ± 0.015 %o for 5isO and 0.025\\n± 0.011 %0 for 513C.

The unstable or radioactive isotope, 14C or radiocarbon, accounts for\\napproximately lx 10\"\\'° % of total carbon present in nature (Bowman, 1990) and is\\ncontinually produced in the upper atmosphere through the interaction of neutrons\\n5180 (%o) = [(lsO/160 sample / 180/l60 standard) - 1] * 1000 (Eq. 2.6)\\n813C (%0) = [(13C/12C sample / 13C/,2C standard) - 1] * 1000 (Eq. 2.7)\\n64\\nChapter 2 Study area, materials and methods\\n(produced by cosmic rays) upon 14N (nitrogen). In the atmosphere, 14C rapidly\\nbecomes carbon dioxide, 14C02, and is absorbed by the oceans and enters all living\\norganisms via life processes. Living organisms in the terrestrial biosphere are largely\\nin equilibrium with atmospheric 14C (due to rapid gaseous exchange and\\nreplenishment through life processes). The uptake of 14C in marine organisms is more\\ncomplex, as detailed in section 2.7.2, since marine organisms derive carbon from\\nseawater. Upon death of an organism, the carbon uptake required for life ceases and\\nthe system becomes \\'closed\\', and the 14C present in the organism begins to decay.\\nSince the rate of decay of 14C is known (5,568 ± 30 years; Libby, 1955), the\\napproximate year of death can be calculated by measuring the residual 14C activity.\\nSee Bowman (1990) for a review of the processes.\\nThe radiometric method of estimating the age of sample material using radiocarbon\\ndating rests on 5 main assumptions (Bowman, 1990; Lowe & Walker, 1997):\\n1) Radiocarbon is continually produced in the atmosphere, with constant\\nproduction rates over time.\\n2) The 14C concentration (i.e. the 14C:12C ratio) is equal in all parts of the\\nbiosphere, i.e., there are no vital effects or variance between different species\\nof organisms.\\n3) The 14C concentration in the biosphere is in equilibrium with the 14C\\nconcentration in the atmosphere, therefore assuming rapid mixing between the\\nreservoirs. All living organisms require carbon to construct their skeletons or\\ntissue, and this carbon is derived from carbon dioxide present in the\\natmosphere or dissolved in water. Therefore, the organism should be in\\nisotopic equilibrium with its reservoir.\\n4) The decay rate of radiocarbon is known.\\n5) Radiocarbon exchange between the biosphere and the organism ceases when\\nthe organism dies. The system becomes \\'closed\\' and since the 14C is no longer\\nreplenished, the 14C begins to decay.\\nThese assumptions are vital for applying the methodology of radiocarbon dating,\\nhowever in reality there are many complications and the assumptions are not strictly\\ncorrect. For example, in situ material can undergo diagenetic alterations and 14C\\nproduction varies over time (section 2.7.6). Other problems encountered in 14C dating\\n65\\nChapter 2 Study area, materials and methods\\nare contamination of the sample by \\'old\\' carbon, such as limestone (often referred to\\nas the hard water effect ) which contains no active 14C and therefore yields\\nradiocarbon ages much older than expected since the ratio of 14C/12C is decreased (e.g.\\nHeier-Nielsen et al., 1995), and contamination by modern 14C, resulting in\\nradiocarbon ages younger than expected (Pilcher, 1991).\\n2.7.2 Radiocarbon dates from marine organisms\\nRadiocarbon in the atmosphere is rapidly mixed, and the distribution of atmospheric\\ncarbon can be assumed to be relatively homogeneous in comparison to radiocarbon in\\nthe oceanic reservoir. Atmospheric radiocarbon can only enter the ocean via mixing\\nacross the air-ocean surface, thus the 14C replenishment of the C02 dissolved in the\\noceanic reservoir is severely restricted given the size of the ocean reservoir.\\nThe process of 14C decay and restricted replenishment of 14C in the surface ocean\\nresults in a general deficiency of 14C, with the surface ocean displaying a lower\\nspecific 14C activity of approximately 0.95 relative to the atmospheric I4C activity of 1\\n(Olsson, 1984, and Bowman, 1991). Hence the surface ocean appears older than it\\nactually is, i.e. it has an \\'apparent age\\'. Since marine organisms derive carbon from\\nseawater as suggested from the 13C values of their CaCC>3 shell (Mook & Vogel, 1968\\nand Olsson & Osadebe, 1974) they will also display an apparent age, since they\\nexhibit 14C values similar to those in the surrounding ocean reservoir. By comparing\\nmeasured marine l4C ages with the equivalent atmospheric 14C age, the marine\\nreservoir l4C age, R(t) is determined. The 14C deficiency of a water mass represents\\nR(t) and this age should be applied to conventional radiocarbon dates in order to\\ncorrect for growth in a given reservoir (Stuiver et al., 1986b). The modelled global\\nreservoir age of the surface ocean is taken to be approximately 400 years (Stuiver &\\nBraziunas, 1993) and the difference in R(t) from the global model curve of the surface\\nocean defines regional 14C deviations (AR), i.e. the marine reservoir age of the sample.\\nIn most regions, the thermocline between the well-mixed shallow surface ocean (0-75\\nm) and the deep ocean inhibits the exchange of C02 between these two reservoirs.\\nSince carbon in the deep ocean has a long residence time and is replenished almost\\nexclusively by 14C from the surface ocean, the deep ocean has, on average, a much\\n66\\nChapter 2 Study area, materials and methods\\nlower specific 14C activity than the surface ocean and a greater deficiency in 14C\\n(Olsson, 1984 and Stuiver et al., 1986b), resulting in average R(t) values of ~ 1000\\nyears.\\n2,7,3 Limits of radiocarbon dating\\nThe limit of the detection of 14C is dependent on the background radiation of the\\nmachine and the method used to date the material (e.g. conventional or accelerated\\nmass spectrometry methods; Pilcher, 1991; Gove, 2000). However, the half-life of\\n14C along with the minute concentration of 14C present in most natural sample material\\nresults in the dating method reaching it\\'s limitations by approximately 45,000 years.\\nFor example, by 30,000 years and 50,000 years, there is approximately 1% and 0.1%,\\nrespectively, of the initial 14C left in the sample.\\nThe detonation of the first nuclear atom bomb in AD 1945 and subsequent nuclear\\nweapons testing, released vast amounts of bomb 14C into the atmosphere, interfering\\nwith the natural 14C equilibrium in organisms. The bomb peak was identified in the\\nnorthern hemispheric atmosphere in 1963 (figure 2.15) with approximately a 100%\\nincrease in the 14C/12C ratio (Olsson, 1984). However, tree ring archives suggest that\\natmospheric 14C was influenced by bomb14C enrichment by 1955 (Cain & Suess,\\n1976), thus AD 1950 is conventionally accepted as the \\'youngest\\' limit at which\\nmaterial can be radiocarbon dated, with 14C dates conventionally reported as years BP,\\nwhere BP is AD 1950 (Stuiver & Polach, 1977). The serendipitous introduction of\\nbomb-produced radiocarbon into the environment has enhanced the understanding of\\nthe global carbon cycle; 14C enrichment acts as a geochemical tracer, improving our\\nknowledge and understanding of atmospheric mixing and oceanic processes (e.g.\\nLevin & Hesshaimer, 2000; Nydal, 2000). The oceanic reservoir showed a lagged\\nresponse (due to inhibited mixing) to bomb produced 14C, e.g. bomb A14C was first\\ndetected in the 1959-1960 band of an Arctica islandica shell from the Georges Bank\\narea of the North Atlantic Ocean, whilst the oceanic bomb A14C peak occurred in\\nthel973-1975 band (Weidman & Jones, 1993).\\n67\\nChapter 2 Study area, materials and methods\\n2.7.4 Measuring radiocarbon activity\\nRadiocarbon age determinations in this thesis were obtained using accelerated mass\\nspectrometry (AMS) dating, primarily since this method requires a small sample size,\\napproximately 50-100 mg of shell material in comparison to 50-100 g of shell material\\nrequired for conventional dating (i.e. gas proportional counting or liquid scintillation\\ncounting; Bowman, 1991)\\nAMS works by measuring the ratio of carbon isotopes in the sample material (i.e. the\\nnumber of 14C atoms present with respect to 13C atoms) via the detection of elemental\\natoms according to their atomic mass (see Linick et ai, 1989 and Gove, 2000 for\\nreviews). Sample material is prepared for AMS dating, graphitised and embedded in a\\ncathode which is placed in the machine at the source end (figure 2.16). The graphite\\ntarget is bombarded with a caesium negative ion sputter source and the resultant\\ncarbon negative ion beam is focused into a straight line of travel down the AMS\\nsystem (using a combination of focusing devices, electrostatic attraction, polarity\\nchanges and magnetic deflection) towards the Faraday cup detectors (Linick et al.,\\n1989; Bowman, 1990; Gove, 2000). The measured 14C/13C ratio is compared to ratios\\nobtained from the standards and corrected to the 13C/12C ratio measured for the same\\nsample, to give a 14C/12C ratio to be used in the age determinations.\\n2.7.5 Calculating and reporting radiocarbon dates\\nA radiocarbon age determination, t, is based upon;\\nt= [(T/ln2)* ln(Io/I)} (Eq. 2.8)\\nwhere T is the known 14C half-life, I0 is the 14C/12C of a modern material, ie. a\\nstandard and I is the 14C/12C ratio of the material to be dated (Nydal, 2000). NBS\\noxalic acid is typically used as a standard for 14C dating, and is based on the 14C\\nactivity in recent wood in 1950 AD. Radiocarbon ages are reported relative to this\\nstandard where;\\n814C = [(I -10) *1000 / I0] (Eq.2.9)\\n68\\nChapter 2 Study area, materials and methods\\nFigure 2.15 Nuclear tests in the atmosphere and the subsequent changes in atmospheric 14C level.\\nTaken from Nydal (2000).\\n2 MV tandem accelerator\\nsample\\nFigure 2.16 A schematic diagram illustrating the basic components of a tandem accelerator used for AMS\\nradiocarbon dating (Bowman, 1990).

AMS dating at Aarhus University is centered around the 6 MV FIVEC\\nEN type tandem accelerator (http://www.phys.au.dk/ams/snfappl2004condens.pdf). AMS radiocarbon\\ndating of Loch Sunart core matieral was pre-treated at the NERC Radiocarbon Laboratory, East Kilbride\\nand measured on the General lonex 2.5 MV AMS machine at the University of Arizona.\\n69\\nChapter 2 Study area, materials and methods\\nThough shell material is typically in isotopic equilibrium with the dissolved\\nbicarbonate of the ocean (Mook & Vogel, 1968; Olsson & Osadebe, 1974), the\\n14C/12C ratio measured in shell material must be corrected to account for the\\nfractionation of isotopes during thermodynamic interactions between the organism\\nand its environment (e.g. Craig, 1954; Olsson, 1984). Since 14C decays over time, the\\n14C/12C ratio is corrected using the 513C value (section 2.6.4.3, equation 2.6) which is\\nmeasured independently from the 14C/12C ratio. Thus the formula for A14C (Stuiver &\\nPolach, 1977), which includes the correction for isotopic fractionation and represents\\nthe \\'noramlised\\' value to the base value of -25 %c with respect to the standard\\ncarbonate (VPDB; http://www.cl4dating.com/agecalc.html), is calculated by;\\nA14C = S14C - 2(513C + 25) (1 + 814C / 1000) (Eq. 2.10)\\nThe conventional radiocarbon age, R, is then calculated by;\\nR = -8033 In (1 + A14C/1000) (Eq.2.11)\\nRadiocarbon ages are reported to guidelines stated in Stuiver & Polach (1977), i.e.\\nreported relative to 95% of the activity of the standard NBS oxalic acid in AD 1950,\\nnormalised to 5I3C = -19%o with respect to the PDB standard, and accompanied by a\\n1 ^\\nstandard error of 1 standard deviation and the 5 C value\\n2.7.6 Calibrating radiocarbon dates\\nCalender years and radiocarbon years exhibit a non-linear relationship (Libby et al.,\\n1949) with a curve characterized by high frequency variations superimposed on long-\\nterm A14C trends (figure 2.17). These A14C variations are primarily caused by cosmic\\nray flux, solar activity, variations in ocean ventilation and geomagnetic intensity (e.g.\\nStuiver et al., 1991; Stuiver & Braziunas, 1993; Goslar et al., 1995; Laj et al., 1996;\\nDruffel, 1997; Bard, 1998; Hughen et al., 2004a). Therefore empirical radiocarbon\\ncalibration curves (e.g. IntCal98/Intcal04 and marine98/Marine04; Stuiver & Polach,\\n1977; Stuiver et al., 1998a; Stuiver et al., 1998b; Hughen et al., 2004b; Reimer et al.,\\n2004a) are used to convert conventional radiocarbon years to calendar years (figure\\n2.17).\\n70\\nChapter 2 Study area, materials and methods\\nQ-\\nCO\\nTO\\n01\\n>,\\nc\\no\\n-Q\\n\"D\\nro\\ncc\\n12000\\n10000\\n8000\\n6000\\n4000\\n2000\\nINTCAL 98\\nmarine98\\ny=x\\n12000 10000 8000 6000 4000 2000\\nCalender age, years\\nFigure 2.17 Atmospheric (INTCAL 98; solid black line) and marine (marine98; grey solid line)\\nradiocarbon calibration curves from 12,000 cal BP to 0 cal BP (i.e. 1950 AD).

This Windows based program utilises a variety of\\nstatistical approaches such as intercept or probability methods on the empirical\\nradiocarbon calibration curves of IntCal98 and marine98 (the atmospheric and marine\\nradiocarbon calibration curves respectively; figure 2.17; Stuiver et al., 1998a; Stuiver\\net al., 1998b). The new calibrations curves; IntCal04 and Marine 04 (Hughen et al.,\\n2004b; Reimer et al., 2004a) were not published at the time 14C ages from the thesis\\nwere calibrated.\\nThe surface ocean response to the atmospheric forcing of A14C naturally filters the\\natmospheric data indicative of a 100-200 year moving average (Stuiver et al., 1998a)\\nand the deep ocean exhibits a buffering effect on atmospheric CCL (Levin &\\nHesshaimer, 2000), hence the marine curve is smoother than the atmospheric\\ncalibration curve (figure 2.17). Though the modelled global surface ocean reservoir\\nage, *R, is taken to be 400 years (Stuiver & Braziunas, 1993), marine reservoir ages,\\nR(t) can vary geographically and therefore are normally expressed as a deviation (AR)\\nfrom the global average value. Calibration of radiocarbon dates with respect to\\nmarine reservoir ages and regional deviations are discussed in detail in chapter 4.\\nCurrently, radiocarbon dates older than ~ 26 kcal BP cannot be calibrated reliably due\\nto the dearth of empirical calibration data ranging from this age to the limitations of\\nradiocarbon dating at -40,000 years BP (Hughen et al., 2004b; Reimer et al., 2004a),\\nthough work continues to extend the limits of calibration (van der Plicht et al., 2004).\\nMaterial \\'younger\\' than 1950 AD cannot be calibrated via conventional calibration\\ncurves due to interference from bomb produced l4C, though a new calibration program\\nCALIBomb (http://calib.qub.ac.uk/CALIBomb/frameset.html) was recently released\\nto calibrate 14C dates by the fraction of modern carbon (F14C) in the sample (Reimer et\\nal., 2004b). Additional problems include the punctuation of the radiocarbon\\ncalibration curve by several radiocarbon plateaux of near constant l4C age centred\\naround approximately 12,700, 10, 000 and 9,500 years BP (Lowe & Walker, 1998),\\nand the \\'Suess effect\\'. Suess (1955) reported that the 14C activity in 20th century\\nwood was ~1 % less than the activity for mid-19th century wood (later recalculated to\\napproximate 2.3-3% by Stuiver & Quay, 1981). This secular decrease in activity is\\nattributed to the dilution of the atmospheric I4C/12C ratio by the combustion of ancient\\n72\\nChapter 2 Study area, materials and methods\\nfossil fuels during the industrial revolution, which introduced inactive CO2 (i.e. no\\n14C) into the atmosphere. Stuiver & Quay (1981) reported a pre-bomb A14C decrease\\nof 20 ± 1.2 %o from wood samples obtained in 1949-1951 in comparison to the pre-\\nindustrial levels seen in 1855-1864, and indicated that the industrial CO2 emissions up\\nto 1950 accounted for -85 % of the A14C decline with the remaining 15% attributed to\\nnatural variability. This \\'Suess effect\\' can also be seen in the ocean 14C record (e.g.\\nSonnerup et al., 1999; Kortzinger et al., 2003) and is manifested by an increase in the\\nreservoir age of the surface and deep ocean between the period 100-0 years BP\\n(AD 1850 - 1950; Stuiver et al., 1986a).\\n2.7.7 Sample acquisition / Laboratory methods for 14C dating of Scottish coastal\\nmaterial\\n2.7.7.1 Paired dates from a Loch Etive core (GC008) and a Loch Sunart core\\n(SC102)\\nGravity cores from Loch Etive along with Sholkovitch and gravity cores from Loch\\nSunart were inspected for horizons which contained shell material and plant material.\\nThere were few horizons with paired marine carbonate-terrestrial organic material,\\nand some of these horizons were unsuitable due to low masses of organic material.\\nOnce extracted from the cores, the samples were rinsed with deionised water, dried at\\n40°C and placed in glass sample bottles.\\nEsbern Warncke (Biological Institute, University of Bergen, Norway, visiting scientist\\nat the University of Aarhus, Denmark) inspected the terrestrial organic material from\\nthe cores. Sample AAR-7491 was identified as wood, possibly a fragment of birch\\ntwig, and sample AAR-7493 as oak fragments that are either charred or have been in\\nan acidic environment. To ensure that the source of the organic material was\\nterrigeneous, the C/N ratios of the sample material were determined following the\\ntechnique of King et al., (1998). The C/N ratios were measured by Mr. T. Brand at\\nthe Dunstaffnage Marine Laboratory, Oban.\\nThe remaining organic and carbonate materials were prepared for AMS dating\\nfollowing the methods described in section 2.7.7.2 and analysed at Aarhus University,\\nDenmark.\\n73\\nChapter 2 Study area, materials and methods\\n2.7.7.2 Preparation ofhistorically collected (museum) shells\\nTen molluscs collected prior to 1950 were obtained from the National Museum of\\nScotland, Edinburgh (details presented in chapter 4, table 4.2). The museum archives\\ndid not state whether the shells were collected live, but a live collection was assumed\\nfor articulated valves (i.e. connected at the hinge) since an unarticulated shell may be\\nindicative of post-mortem disarticulation and possible reworking. Also, some of the\\nspecimens had the dried remains of the organism in the articulated shell, which may\\nfurther suggest that the shell was live at the time of collection.\\nTwo shells were rejected for dating, due to no known collection year. The Loch\\nCreran bivalve (AAR-7489) is not accompanied by a known collection year (see table\\n4.1), however it was bequeathed to the museum by Alexander Somerville between\\n1843 - 1907 AD, so it is definitely pre-bomb and expands the data from the sea-loch\\nenvironment. Additionally, the Limaria hians shell from the Clyde, was rejected for\\ntwo reasons; 1) the shell morphology is such that when alive, the shell cannot be fully\\narticulated, 2) the location was within the Clyde region, which was represented by\\nother samples which came from more restricted marine environments.\\nThe chemical preparation of the historical shell material (for the marine radiocarbon\\nreservoir work) was carried out under the guidance of Prof. Jan Heinemeier, Ann-\\nBerith Jensen and Vibeke Jensen at the AMS 14C Dating Laboratory, University of\\nAarhus, Denmark.\\nApproximately 12 mg of carbonate shell material typically yields 1 mg of carbon,\\nhowever -40 mg of material was sliced from each sample to prepare for AMS dating,\\nwhich allows for the potential loss of material during the pre-treatment processes and\\nprepares enough carbon for two AMS dates. The periostracum was scraped off the\\nshells where possible and on the larger scallop shells which are know to live for up to\\n6 years, the outer growth bands were selected to ensure that the youngest shell\\nmaterial was obtained. Sample material was prepared for AMS dating using the\\ntechniques reported in Heier-Nielsen et al., (1995), i.e. cleaned, dried, and acid etched\\n(using 1M HC1) to remove approximately 20-25% of the outer shell surface. The\\norganic component was removed from the sample material by reduction methods (i.e.\\nheating to 80°C for 12 hours in a solution containing KMn04 ). After cleaning and\\n74\\nChapter 2 Study area, materials and methods\\ndrying the sample the mass after chemical preparation was determined.\\nApproximately 14 mg of the prepared sample was then carefully placed in the limb of\\na double limbed reaction tube. The remainder of the sample was placed in a labelled\\nphial to be used later if necessary. Concentrated phosphoric acid was carefully placed\\nin the other limb of the tube and a vacuum was created in the tubes using a vacuum\\nrig. Once the tubes had been evacuated, the acid was added to the sample material\\nand left overnight in a 25°C water bath, and the following reaction took place to\\nconvert the carbonate material into carbon dioxide (co2):\\nThe CO2 samples were then ready to be converted to graphite (since the conventional\\nAMS dating method requires a source of solid carbon) as described in section 2.7.5.3.\\nFor organic samples, carbonate material was removed from a 15 mg sample by adding\\n1M HC1 acid and leaving for 1 hour at 80°C. The acid was removed and 1M NaOH\\nadded (left at 80°C for approximately 3 hours or longer with a solution change if\\nnecessary) to remove the humic fractions from the sample material. This is an\\nimportant step as humic acids are highly mobile in terrestrial sedimentary\\nenvironments and are often younger in age than the sample material itself. Sample\\nSC102-68 was left at room temperature in 1M NaOFI, as the material was too fragile\\nfor the usual procedure.\\nThe base solution containing the humic fractions was decanted from the solid sample\\nand 1M HC1 was added to it, covered and left at 80°C for a few hours. An aliquot of\\n1M HC1 was added to the solid sample and left for 1 hour at room temperature, after\\nwhich the sample material for dating was rinsed with deionised water and freeze dried.\\nOnce dry, the sample was weighed again and approximately 50 % taken for\\ngraphitisation. The material for dating was placed in a quartz ampule containing\\ncopper oxide, vacuumed and sealed, and combusted at 900°C for on a lhour cycle in a\\nmuffle furnace for the following reaction to take place:\\nCaC03 + 2H+\\n25°C\\n*- co2 + h2o (Eq. 2.12)\\nCuO\\nC\\n900°C ^ C°2 + CU (Eq. 2.13)\\n75\\nChapter 2 Study area, materials and methods\\nThe humic fraction was centrifuged, freeze dried and weighed to determine the\\npercentage of humics in the sample. This fraction was not used in dating and was\\nlater discarded.\\nThe vessels containing the prepared carbonate and organic material for dating were\\nattached to the graphitisation machine. For each sample, the necessary volume of\\nCO2 gas to make 1.1 mg of Carbon was moved across to a reaction tube (containing a\\nsmall amount of Cobalt powder) after gas had been collected for S13C measurements.\\nThe required volume of H2 gas was then added to the reactor tubes for the following\\nreaction to take place;\\nC02 + 2H2 C° „ C + 2H20 (Eq. 2.14)\\n700°C\\nThe 1st reactor tubes were cooled to -35°C to freeze out the water and the 2nd reactor\\ntubes were left at 700°C overnight for the reaction to complete. The resulting graphite\\nmaterial was embedded in a labelled cathode using silver powder and a machine press,\\nand the sample was taken for AMS dating.\\nAll the 14C measurements were carried out using the EN tandem accelerator at the\\nUniversity of Aarhus. The tandem accelerator lacks the sensitivity to measure 13C\\nisotopes precisely, therefore AMS measurements use the 14C /12C ratio measured at\\n1 o /\\nAarhus and the 8 C values were measured by Dr. A.

The climate of NW\\nEurope is heavily influenced by the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), which is the\\ndominant mode of atmospheric variability in the Northern Hemisphere (e.g. Hurrell,\\n1995, 1996), particularly during the winter months (section 1.3). The positive (or high\\nindex) phases of the NAO are characterised by the occurrence of a strong high-\\npressure system over the Azores region along with an intense Icelandic low pressure.\\nDuring these phases the Atlantic storm track is deflected northwards bringing warm\\nand saturated \\'oceanic\\' air masses to NW Europe (Ruprecht et al., 2002) and results in\\na mild and wet winter over NW Europe. Conversely, during negative (low) index\\nyears, the storm track is deflected towards southern Europe and NW Europe generally\\nexperiences cold and dry winters.\\nThe high relief of the Loch Sunart catchment area (figure 2.2), along with it\\'s location\\non the NW European margin (figure 2.1) results in a high amount of orographic\\nrainfall received from the prevailing westerly weather system, thus the climate of this\\nregion is likely to be strongly influenced by the NAO. Hurrell (1995) showed that the\\ncorrelation coefficients between winter (December-March) precipitation and the NAO\\nindex for a number of European stations were stronger for coastal stations (e.g.\\nBergen: 0.77 and Stornoway: 0.75) than for inland stations (e.g. Oslo: 0.21 and\\nFrankfurt: 0.19). Chandler & Wheater (2002) have also demonstrated the seasonally\\nvarying impact of the NAO upon rainfall variability from the west of Ireland. The\\ncoastal catchments of NW Scotland receive high mean annual precipitation and are\\nalso expected to exhibit high correlation coefficients with the NAO. Thin and poorly\\ndeveloped soils in these mountainous regions, together with generally steep slopes and\\nlow soil moisture deficits, translate rainfall rapidly into surface runoff (Black &\\nCranston, 1995). Therefore, periods of prolonged and heavy rainfall result in a\\npronounced increase in freshwater input into the fjords.\\n78\\nChapter 3 Climate and hydrography\\nGiven the importance of freshwater inputs in fjordic hydrography (section 1.8.2), the\\nNAO has the potential to impact upon the circulation of Loch Sunart, with positive\\nindex years resulting in less frequent deep water renewal events and lower salinity in\\nthe upper basins, and vice versa for negative index years. Sedimentary archives\\nobtained from Loch Sunart have the potential to yield palaeoclimatic information on\\nNorth Atlantic climate and oceanographic variability. There is a dearth of long-term\\nobservational data from Scottish sea lochs, so to test whether the NAO does\\nsignificantly influence the circulation of Loch Sunart, a modeling approach was\\nimplemented for an extreme positive NAO year (1988) and an extreme negative year\\n(1996; Jones et al., 1997) using daily wind and freshwater discharge data (from\\nnearby stations) as inputs (Gillibrand et al., 2005).\\n3.2 Aims and objectives\\nClimate and oceanographic data from NW Scotland are scarce. A long, monthly\\nmarine temperature series is available from Millport from 1953 onwards and the\\nScottish Environmental Protection Agency (SEPA) has recorded the precipitation and\\ntemperature in the nearby Polloch catchment and the mean daily discharge of the\\nRiver Polloch since 1986 (see figure 3.1 for locations). Jones & Lister (2004) have\\nrecently published long (-100 years) regional temperature data for Scotland and\\nNorthern Ireland (see section 3.4.1). Thus, the major aims of the study were:\\n1) To test whether the Loch Sunart catchment experiences similar climate to\\nnearby stations with longer time series. A weather station was placed at\\nAriundle (in the Loch Sunart catchment area, figure 2.5) to record the\\nprevailing weather at the head of the loch over a 2 year period (see chapter\\n2). Pearson\\'s linear correlations and regression techniques were used to\\ncompare the temperature and precipitation data from the overlap of the\\nAriundle observations, the recorded data from the Polloch weather station\\nand the longer temperature series of Jones & Lister (2004).\\n2) To identify how the NAO influences the local climate of NW Scotland\\nusing the NAO indices of Jones et al., (1997).\\n3) To observe the temperature and salinity at 40 m water depth in the inner\\nand main basins of Loch Sunart over an annual cycle using stationary\\nhydrographic moorings (section 2.3.1), and to compare these data with\\n79\\nChapter 3 Climate and hydrography\\nFigure 3.1 Station locations for the Ariundle and Polloch weather stations (star) along with the\\nstations included in the Scottish air temperature series (black circles) from Jones & Lister, 2004.\\nThe Scottishlsles temperature (SIT) series consists of data from Stornoway, Kirkwall and Lerwick;\\nthe Northern Ireland temperature (NIT) series has data from Armagh only (not shown) and the\\nScottish Mainland temperature (SMT) series combines data from Wick, Braemar, Leuchars,\\nAuchincruive and Eskdalemuir.

See Gillibrand et al., (2005) for\\ndetails.\\n3.3. Results ofMeteorological data\\n3.3.1. New instrumental data\\nThe observed temperature, wind speed, wind run and precipitation data from the\\nAriundle weather station over the observed period, 23/04/2001 - 28/07/2001 and the\\n14/08/2001 - 04/09/2003, are reported in appendix 5. Seasonality in the temperature\\ndata is evident (figure 3.2), with warmer temperatures occurring during summer\\nmonths (June, July, August) and cooler temperatures occurring in the winter months\\n(December, January, February). Clear seasonal signals are not immediately seen in\\nthe precipitation, wind run and maximum wind speed, though maximum values do\\ntend to occur in the winter months (figure 3.2). Because wind data is missing from the\\nfirst Kipp & Zonen weather station deployment (section 2.4.2.2), analyses will focus\\non data collected from the second Campbell Scientific weather station 14/08/2001 -\\n04/09/2003.\\nHistograms in figure 3.3 illustrate the large variability of meteorological data\\nexperienced by the Ariundle weather station over the observed time period, and the\\nunimodal spread of the data reflects a strong seasonal forcing. The histograms for\\nmaximum daily wind speed (ms\\'1) and total wind run (km per 24 hours) are similar\\ndue to the positive relationship between these two variables (figure 3.4) i.e. during\\nperiods of maximum wind speed, more wind passes through the sensor.\\n81\\nChapter 3 Climate and hydrography\\nA\\n.iio*^ ^IOOE001 28loaiin001 xtrtf1®7\\' 25l06\\',|20°2 23I09\\'iftOOl 22l\\\\2l|20°2 221091iftOO* A&I09 ft003\\nE 160\\nE\\nQAIO*1|20°A 30 io6\\',IZO°A\\nj^yAAA /LaJM,\\naEOO1 21112\\'J*** 2.1103\\'2003 25100\\',12003 23100 ft002 22l«\\'12002 22I03E003 jo|o62003 flEOOO\\n.M03E001 20,00^00^ ^,,2^003 fl|052002 ^12002 ^VSf*1 ,3B0E°°3\\nD\\nE 25\\nvAAAA^-vv\\nQllO\\'liE001 3OBOEO03 .BOEOO^ 21112\\'.12001 21103\\',2002 ,200226106\\'\\nDate\\n,912002 ^,212002 ^loO^ jOIOOEO03 ,81091200s\\nFigure 3.2 Daily data (with a 7 point moving average) from the Ariundle weather station showing:\\nA) average temperature; B) precipitation; C) total wind run over 24 hours and D) maximum wind speed.\\n82\\nChapter 3 Climate and hydrography\\n3.3.2 Data quality\\nThe weather station was left unattended for periods of a few months and during this\\ntime it is possible that the rain gauge could have been blocked by organic debris such\\nas leaf litter and bird faeces. However, the internal tipping mechanism was checked\\nduring each visit and there were no signs of blockages.\\nA few problems occurred during the collecting of the data: 1) The first 8 days of data\\ncollection (14/08/2001 - 22/08/2001) show zero values for precipitation, wind run and\\nwind speed. Zero precipitation days occur throughout the precipitation data and\\naccount for approximately 21% of the data collection period. However, with the\\nexception of the first 8 days, no other days record zero wind speed and wind run\\nsuggesting that the zero days do not truly represent the weather conditions at the time\\nof collection and are therefore anomalous measurements. Therefore the\\nmeasurements from these days are not included in the final data set. There is no\\nexplanation as to why data collection begins on the 23/08/01; 2) Data was lost\\nbetween 21/01/2003 - 11/02/2003 due to overwriting by the data-logger and; 3)\\nPrecipitation data is unavailable from the 17/03/2003 onwards due to problems with\\nwildlife (possibly a Marag fabulosus aurelius) destroying the electric cables running\\nbetween the rain gauge and the weather station.\\n3.3.3 Validation with Polloch temperature and precipitation data\\nThe Ariundle temperature series is in good agreement with the Polloch temperature\\ndata (figure 3.5), with a strong positive correlation (r = 0.93, p = 0.0) and an R value\\nof 0.88. Figure 3.5 shows three obvious anomalies within the Polloch temperature\\ndata. These anomalous temperatures occur in May and July; months which are\\nunlikely to have daily mean temperatures of approximately -11 and -5 °C. Removing\\nthese data improves the relationship between the 2 variables, giving a regression\\nequation of y = 0.9688 x + 0.5092 (R2 = 0.8763) rather than y = 0.9182 x + 1.0224 (R2\\n= 0.8202). There are other data points which appear to be anomalous, for example,\\nthose lying above the regression line at around 5°C for Polloch temperature and\\n~13°C for Ariundle temperature. These data points occur within summer months and\\ncould be due to local effects experienced at the different weather station locations.\\n83\\nChapter 3 Climate and hydrography\\n0 4 8 12 16\\nAverage daily temperature, °C\\n60 90 120 150\\nAverage daily precipitation, mm\\n120\\nvJOO\\n\"O\\n£ 80\\nI ■\\n£ 60\\n40\\n20\\n0\\nTTy^\\n8 12 16 20\\nMaximum daily wind speed, ms\"1\\n100 200 300 400 500 600\\nTotal wind run, km per 24 hours\\nFigure 3.3 Histograms showing the frequency, i.e. number of days of A) average daily temperature (1\\nbar = 1 °C); B) average daily precipitation (1 bar = 10 mm);C) maximum daily wind speed (1 bar= 1ms-1)\\nand D) total daily wind run experienced (1 bar = 20 km per 24 hours) at the Ariundle weather station\\nover the collection period 14/08/2001 -4/09/2003(14/08/2001 - 17/03/2003 for the precipitation data).\\n0 5 10 15 20 25 30\\nMaximum wind speed, ms-1\\nFigure 3.4 The strong positive relationship between maximum daily wind speed and total wind run\\nrecorded by the Ariundle weather station for the collection period 23/08/2001 to 4/09/2003.\\n84\\nChapter 3 Climate and hydrography\\nThe gradient from the linear regression equation (Ariundle temperature = 0.9688*\\nPolloch temperature + 0.5092, figure 3.5) suggests the Ariundle weather station\\nexperiences similar temperature trends to the Polloch weather station albeit with\\ntemperatures being about 0.5 °C warmer. This offset could be due to either local\\neffects experienced due to the different station locations, or by anomalies within the\\ndata set.\\nA fairly strong positive correlation exists between the two data precipitation sets (r =\\n0.693, p = 0.0, R2 = 0.48) and figure 3.6 suggests the Ariundle station receives slightly\\nhigher levels of precipitation than the Polloch station. The Ariundle-Polloch\\nprecipitation relationship is not as strong as the temperature relationship and this is\\nlikely to be due to local effects such as topography and rain shadowing, however the\\ntwo stations clearly exhibit similar precipitation patterns, i.e. experience the same\\nweather systems (figure 3.7). The intensity and occurrence of precipitation varies\\nbetween the two stations (figure 3.8) with the Polloch station recording more days\\nwith zero or light to moderate precipitation (1-15 mm) and the Ariundle station\\ntending towards heavier precipitation days. However, the relationship between the\\ntwo data sets is much stronger (r = 0.911, p = 0.0) when the total monthly\\nprecipitation data is compared (figure 3.9). This suggests that although precipitation\\nvalues between the two neighbouring catchments may differ on a day to day basis, the\\ntotal monthly precipitation received by the catchments is comparable with the\\nAriundle station receiving higher precipitation per month.\\n3.3.4 Seasonal and inter-annual differences in Ariundle weather\\nThe NAO is known to affect the winter weather of the UK (see chapter 1). The data\\nobtained from the Ariundle weather station covers two winter periods; 2001/2002 and\\n2002/2003. NAO indices are ascribed to the latter year of the winter period (since the\\nmajority of the monthly pressure data lie in this year), hence these two periods\\nbecome NAO years of 2002 and 2003. Although both 2002 and 2003 are NAO\\npositive years, the indices differ at +0.79 and +0.4 respectively, thus one would expect\\nthe winter of 2002 to be milder and wetter than the winter of 2003.\\n85\\nChapter 3 Climate and hydrography\\n-15 J\\nPolloch temperature, °C\\nFigure 3.5.

As predicted, during the more positive NAO year (2002), Ariundle\\nexperienced a milder and wetter winter than during 2003, with an average temperature\\nof 4.1 °C and an average daily precipitation of 18.1 mm in comparison to the averages\\nof 2.8 °C and 6.5 mm precipitation recorded at Ariundle during the 2003 winter\\n(figure 3.10). The total wind run (i.e. over the season) at Ariundle is also greater in\\n2002 (15978 km) than in 2003 (8636 km), probably due to the Atlantic storm track\\nbeing slightly deflected to the south during the less positive NAO year.\\n3.4 Results of oceanographic data\\n3.4.1 CTD data\\nTemperature and salinity (CTD) profiles taken along the central axis of Loch Sunart\\nall show a distinct thermocline and halocline (typically occurring at similar water\\ndepths) demonstrating the stratification typical of fjords (figure 3.11; Farmer &\\nFreeland, 1983). Most profiles (excluding figure 3.1 IF) show a well-defined surface\\nlayer approximately 1-3 m thick with temperatures typically 1-2 °C warmer than the\\nwater below and fresher, with salinities reduced by ~ 0.4 in the outer basin, ~ 2 in the\\nmain basin and up to 6 in the inner basin (a salinity of 10 was recorded near the\\nCamoch river inflow). A transitional layer exists beneath the surface layer showing\\nsteadily decreasing temperature and increasing salinities. This layer is more prevalent\\nin the temperature profile with salinity typically reaching a near stable value higher up\\nthe water column, whilst temperature continues to decrease (e.g. figures 3.11 C and\\nE). Deep basin water typically demonstrates a slighter higher salinity than the\\ntransitional layer, with temperatures typically 1-2 °C cooler than the sub-thermocline\\ntemperatures (~ 10-11 °C).\\nAn important point to note is that for most profiles, the temperature and salinity at\\n40m water depth is similar to temperature and salinity at water depths deeper than\\n40m (e.g. figure 3.11 A and B). This suggests that the annual heating cycle observed\\nby the mooring sensors at ~ 40 m water depth (figure 2.11) is likely to be\\nrepresentative of temperatures in the deeper basin waters, although a \\'lag\\' in the\\n89\\nChapter 3 Climate and hydrography\\nTable 3.1 Seasonal averages for the Ariundle weather station data.

The lag time is not consistent throughout the year, for example, there is about\\na 2 week difference between the maximum temperature peaks (with the upper basin\\npreceding the main basin), whilst the minimum temperatures occur within\\napproximately 1 week of each other (figure 3.12a). However, from early December to\\nlate January, the stepwise decrease in the main basin temperature trend slightly\\nprecedes the inner basin trend by 5-7 days and the climbing limb of increasing\\ntemperatures after April 2002 shows interchangeable lags between the main and upper\\nbasins.\\n92\\nChapter 3\\n16\\nClimate and hydrography\\nB\\n36\\n35 -\\n.3\\n\\'c\\n3\\n\\'5\\n34\\n33\\n32 -\\n31\\n30\\n29\\n1/3/01 30/4/01 29/6/01 28/8/01 27/10/01 26/12/01 24/2/02 25/4/02 24/6/02\\nDate\\nFigure 3.12 Hourly temperature (A) and salinity (B) data from the inner basin mooring (black line) and\\nmain basin mooring (grey line) from Loch Sunart.

The inner basin is generally less saline than the main\\nbasin with average salinities of 32.8 and 33.9 respectively. Both series show high\\nvariability on a daily resolution, though the trends in salinity are in no way\\ncomparable (figure 3.12b). The salinity of the main basin remains relatively stable at\\n34, until January 2002 when it decreases to a minimum salinity of 32.9 at the end of\\nthe observation period. The inner basin shows far more variability (on a\\nweekly/monthly basis) in salinity than the main basin, with the salinity reaching\\nminimum values of approximately 31 - 31.7 before increasing to salinities of 33.7 -\\n34, i.e. the occurrence of DWREs (figure 3.12b). From April 2002 onwards, the inner\\nbasin waters become more saline, approaching the salinity of the main basin water\\n(figure 3.12b). This is unusual since the inner basin water is typically derived from a\\nmixture of saline main basin water and entrained sill water (which is a mixture of\\nsaline and brackish surface water) during deep water renewal events. The CTD casts\\neither side of this high salinity period appear to tie in well with the mooring data,\\nsuggesting this is a \\'real\\' event, however the mechanism behind this inner basin high\\nsalinity event is unresolved at present (pers. comm., Dr. P.

The SMT data (figure 3.13)\\n94\\nChapter 3 Climate and hydrography\\ncomprised of data from five stations; Auchincruive, Leuchars, Wick (all coastal\\nstations), Braemar and Eskdalemuir (both inland stations). The SIT data is based on\\ndata from three stations, Kirkwall, Lerwick and Stomoway and the NIT series\\nrepresents data from the Armargh station. Station locations are shown in figure 3.1\\nand further discussion of these data series is presented in Jones & Lister (2004). The\\nCentral England Temperature (CET) series (Manley, 1974; Parker et al., 1992) takes\\nthe averaged temperatures from stations situated in London, Bristol and Manchester.\\nThe CET series spans the longest time frame, extending back to AD 1659, whilst the\\nSMT series spans AD 1800 to AD 2002, the SIT spans AD 1827 to AD 2002 and the\\nNIT series spans from AD 1844 to AD 2002.\\nThere are clear differences in these long temperature series (figure 3.13). Between\\nAD 1844-2002, the mean temperatures are as follows; the CET series has the highest\\nmean temperature at 9.38°C, likely reflecting warmer temperatures from southerly\\nstations; the NIT data has a temperature mean of 8.48°C, and the SIT mean\\ntemperature of 7.70°C. The lowest temperature mean (7.03°C) belongs to the SMT\\nseries and is likely to be a function of the location of stations used in this data series,\\ne.g. data from inland meteorological stations contribute to this series as do stations in\\nthe NE Scotland (such as Leuchars) which may tend towards cooler temperatures than\\nthose on the west and north coast. All the data series show a trend towards increasing\\ntemperatures towards the 21st Century (table 3.2) with the majority of the warming\\noccuring in the 20th Century, which is consistent with trends found in other studies\\n(Mann et al., 1998; Moberg et al., 2005).\\nThe CET, SMT, SIT and NIT temperature data show very strong positive correlations\\nwith Ariundle temperature data (table 3.3), suggesting all localities are affected by the\\nsame weather systems. The strongest correlations are with the SMT and NIT data.\\nLike the Ardnamurchan peninsula, Armagh (NIT) is likely to receive the Atlantic\\nweather systems first, i.e. has a strong maritime climate. Three out of the five stations\\nin the SMT data are coastal (west and east coast) thus the data is also likely influenced\\nby a maritime climate, as is the slightly inland Ariundle station. The weakest\\nrelationship unexpectedly comes from the SIT data, which have stations relatively\\nnear to Sunart (figure 3.1). This could be due to the dampening of the air\\ntemperatures by heat transfer from surrounding ocean water (since oceans have higher\\n95\\nChapter 3 Climate and hydrography\\n121\\nSIT SMT NIT CET\\no : T T T r ,\\n^ ^ ^ N<*>° N<#>° ^\\nDate\\nFigure 3.13.

Though the NIT data shows the strongest correlation with the Ariundle\\ndata, the SMT correlation is only marginally weaker and the gradient of the regression\\nequation is closer to 1, suggesting a more realistic temperature reconstruction as\\ndemonstrated in figure 3.14.\\n3.5.2 Comparing precipitation records\\nThough the NW coast of Scotland receives high total annual precipitation (table 2.1),\\nprecipitation series from different sites are unlikely to show strong relationships due to\\nrain shadowing and local effects, though they may have similar precipitation series. It\\nis interesting to note that although the correlation between the monthly Ariundle and\\nPolloch precipitation data is much stronger than the relationship between the monthly\\nAriundle and the monthly England and Wales precipitation (EWP) series (figure\\n3.15b; data obtained from the Met Office website; http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/\\nresearch/hadleycentre/CR data/Monthly/HadEWP act.txt), the trends in the Ariundle\\ndata are equally as comparable to the trends in the EWP as they are to the Polloch data\\n(figure 3.15a). Therefore we can assume that the Ariundle catchment is influenced by\\nthe same general weather systems as the EWP stations. The Ariundle station appears\\nto receive a higher total precipitation than the Polloch station (figure 3.15a) probably\\ndue to a rain shadow effect on the Polloch station, since the prevailing westerly local\\nweather is funneled up the axis of Loch Sunart into the Strontian catchment (pers.\\ncomm., Mr. Campbell, 2001 and Dr. P. Gillibrand, 2004). The Polloch station, by\\ncontrast, lies landward and eastward of hilly terrain (figure 2.12). The EWP shows\\nsignificantly lower total monthly precipitation than both Ariundle and Polloch (figure\\n3.15), probably due to regional differences in precipitation patterns. The EWP series\\ncomprises of 5 regional data sets and is likely to include east coast or inland stations\\nwhich lie in the rain shadow of the UK, whilst NW Scotland is one of the first parts of\\nthe UK to receive the prevailing Atlantic weather systems.\\n97\\nChapter 3 Climate and hydrography\\nTable 3.2.

A strong correlation (r = 0.802, p\\n= 0.003) also exists between the winter NAO and the total monthly winter (DJFM)\\nprecipitation from the Polloch station (for periods 1989-1996 and 2000-2003). Since\\nthe Polloch daily precipitation data demonstrates a strong positive correlation with the\\nmean daily flow (MDF) of the River Polloch during the winter months of 1989-1996\\n(r = 0.779, p = 0.0, n = 2764 for the daily data and r = 0.958, p = 0.0, n = 8 for the\\nDJFM average) one would expect a clear NAO signal in the Polloch MDF. Indeed,\\nfigure 3.16 illustrates the influence of the NAO index on the River Polloch averaged\\nwinter MDF (r = 0.865, p = 0.0), with the Polloch MDF clearly following trends in the\\nNAO index. By contrast, the winter (DJFM) NAO: precipitation relationship is very\\nweak for the EWP data (r = 0.14, p = 0.06 for the period 1824-2003 and r = 0.286, p =\\n0.302 for the period 1986-2000), and this is probably due to differences in regional\\nprecipitation patterns which have been averaged across a large area (see section 3.5.2).\\nAs mentioned previously, the Ariundle monthly temperature data may be extended\\nusing the Ariundle temperature: SMT regression equation, i.e.\\nAriundle air temperature (°C) = 1.012* SMTAm + 0.405 (R2 = 0.974) (Eq. 3.1)\\nThe relationship between the annual average SMT and the NAO is weak (r = 0.313, p\\n= 0.0, R2 = 0.1), however the correlation with winter (DJFM) SMT and the NAO is\\nmuch stronger (r = 0.687, p = 0.0); the winter SMT and winter NAO series are seen to\\ncovary for the majority of the time (figure 3.17).

Discrete CTD casts\\nobtained from Loch Sunart (data obtained from Dr. P. Gillibrand) show marine\\ntemperatures similar to those recorded at both the Tiree and Millport marine stations\\n(figure 3.18), though lags between the data series are evident and this is probably due\\nto the location and exposure of the stations. For example, the Millport temperature\\nseries (see section 3.5.5 for more details) is likely to reflect the seasonal heating cycle\\nof surface waters from a sheltered location (the shallow Clyde Sea) along with a\\nstrong influence of Irish Sea water (e.g. McKay et al., 1986). In contrast, the Tiree\\nstation is situated in an open coastal location (figure 3.1) influenced by both\\nIrish/Clyde Sea water and Atlantic water (McKay et al., 1986), thus the Tiree\\ntemperature series probably represents the heating cycle of open coastal waters.\\nFigure 3.18 shows a fairly good agreement between the Tiree and the Loch Sunart\\ntemperature data, with the latter appearing to lag the Millport data by ~ 2 months, and\\nlike Tiree, Loch Sunart exhibits a smaller annual seasonal temperature range (6.46°C\\nfor the inner basin and 6.61°C for the main basin) in comparison to the Millport\\naverage seasonal range of 8.2°C. Minimum temperatures at Millport (mean) and\\nSunart are comparable at ~ 6.8 °C, whilst the Millport mean maximum temperature\\nexceeds the Sunart maximum temperature by approximately 1.6 °C (maximum\\ntemperatures of 15.06 °C and 13.4 °C respectively). The varying temperature ranges\\nare likely to reflect seasonal stratification, with enhanced surface layer heating in\\nsummer and differences in the water depth of the observations. The Millport data was\\ncollected from the surface water layer whilst the Loch Sunart moorings recorded\\ntemperature at 40 m water depth which is typically below the thermocline (figure\\n3.11). Enhanced wind, wave and storm mixing of the water column during the winter\\nmonths (section 1.8.2) is exemplified by the comparable winter temperatures from\\nMillport and Sunart. The reduced lag time between the Ariundle air temperature\\nseries and the Millport marine temperature series suggests the Millport data may more\\nclosely reflect air temperature (figure 3.19) whilst temperatures in deeper waters (such\\nas the Loch Sunart series) often show a lagged heating cycle in comparison to surface\\nwaters (e.g. Ellett, 1979).\\n101\\nChapter 3 Climate and hydrography\\nFigure 3.17.

The two series clearly covary and linear regression of the two\\ndata series yields the equation ofwinter NAO = 0.75*averaged winter SMT - 1.5654\\n(r2 = 0.472).\\nFigure 3.18. Marine temperature series from Tiree (grey line), Millport (black line) and\\ndiscrete temperature measurements from CTD casts obtained from Loch Sunart (black\\ndiamonds).\\n102\\nChapter 3 Climate and hydrography\\nThough DWREs in sea lochs are driven largely by density changes associated with\\nsalinity fluctuations (Gillibrand et al., 1995), temperature changes (positive or\\nnegative) may accompany the inflow of coastal waters (e.g. Loch Etive; Austin &\\nInall, 2002). Gillibrand et al., (1995) observed temperature increases in the inner\\nbasin bottom water of Loch Sunart during deep water renewal events in 1989,\\nhowever it is interesting to note that the observed seasonal heating cycles of the inner\\nand main basins of Loch Sunart are not significantly perturbed by the occurrence of\\ndeep water renewal events (e.g. figure 3.11). This suggests that the bottom water\\ntemperature of both basins is driven primarily by the coastal water temperature;\\nprobably due to the frequency of DWREs which maintain an \\'open\\' connection of the\\nbasin waters with coastal waters.\\n3.5.4.2 Salinity\\nPeriods of low freshwater input are known to be a driving mechanism (along with\\nwind mixing) of fjordic deep water renewal events (DWREs; see chapter 1). Figure\\n3.20 shows the observed salinity in Loch Sunart with recorded precipitation from the\\nAriundle station. The main basin salinity shows little response to changes in\\nprecipitation, though there is a slight increase in salinity corresponding to the 2nd and\\n3ld DWRE in the inner basin. The inner basin shows much greater variability in\\nsalinity, with salinity increases interpreted as DWREs which appear to occur during\\nperiods of low precipitation. The mooring data suggest the time taken for the inner\\nbasin to completely renew the deep water (i.e. attain salinity maxima) ranges from 36\\nto 47 days (figure 3.20), which agrees well with Gillibrand et al., (1995) who\\nsuggested DWREs were frequent though irregular in Loch Sunart, probably occurring\\nevery 4 weeks. The progressive decrease of salinity is likely due to the wind, tidal and\\nwave mixing (Gade & Edwards, 1980; Farmer & Freeland, 1983; Gillibrand et al.,\\n1995) of less saline surface water into the deeper bottom water, however the rate of\\nsalinity change appears to be dependent on the freshwater input. Periods of high\\nrainfall (e.g. from 21/1/2002 - 21/02/2002) result in relatively rapid salinity decreases\\n(30/1/2002 - 20/2/2002) in comparison to slower and sometimes stepwise salinity\\ndecreases seen elsewhere in the record (e.g. 30/10/2001 - 1/12/2001). Inner basin\\nsalinity also shows significant responses to brief heavy rainfall events, such as those\\non the 30/9/2001 and 29/10/2001, with noticeable changes in the rate of salinity\\n103\\nChapter 3 Climate and hydrography\\n25\\n15\\nE 10\\nInner basin\\nMain basin\\nMillport\\n7 per.

The influence of freshwater inputs into the sea loch (via precipitation in the catchment)\\nis clear in the inner basin salinity, with salinity decreasing following periods of high precipitation and deep\\nwater renewal events (black arrows) seemingly triggered when inner basin salinity is low and precipitation\\nis also low.

The sustained period of heavy rainfall between 18/2/2002 and 11/3/2002\\nappears to have maintained the salinity minimum of the inner basin for much longer\\nthan the previous two salinity minima. This minimum also attains the least saline\\nvalues, which is likely to reflect the delay of the DWRE along with a longer period of\\nfreshwater mixing.\\nThe observed salinity changes in the Loch Sunart basins (over the period August 2001\\nto July 2002) exemplify two important points regarding the circulation of Loch\\nSunart;\\n1) Inner basin salinity responds to (and is significantly modified by) freshwater\\ninputs (received as precipitation) from the surrounding catchment.\\n2) Temperature is not significantly affected by DWREs\\n3.5.5 Availability of marine temperature records from NW Scottish coastal\\nwaters\\nPalaeoenvironmental proxy reconstructions are more robust when compared and\\ncalibrated to historical observations (e.g. Moberg et al., 2005). Given the relatively\\nhigh resolution of Loch Sunart sedimentary archives (chapter 8), it may be possible to\\nobtain palaeoclimate reconstructions on an annual to decadal resolution, thus a long-\\nterm temperature record is essential for comparing proxy temperature data with\\nobserved temperature data. However, there is a dearth of long-term marine\\ntemperature and salinity records from northern UK coastal waters and the Millport\\nmarine temperature series represents the longest continuous sea surface temperature\\nseries from the NW coast of Scotland, with nearly continuous monthly temperature\\nobservations from AD 1953 to AD 2001.\\nThe Millport marine temperature series shows an annual heating cycle typical of shelf\\nseas, with a mean annual temperature range of ~8 °C, which is similar to the\\ntemperature range observed at 40 water depth in Loch Sunart (section 3.5.4).\\nSuperimposed upon this seasonal heating cycle is an inter-annual temperature\\nvariability, with mean annual temperatures ranging from 8.8 °C to 11.24 °C. The\\naverage temperature for May - October coincides with the likely growth period for\\n105\\nChapter 3 Climate and hydrography\\nbenthic foraminifera (see chapter 5), and is therefore an important variable when\\ndealing with palaeoenvironmental records (e.g. Scourse et al., 2004). The May-\\nOctober average temperature (figure 3.21) closely follows the annual average\\ntemperature trends with a mean temperature difference of ~ 2 °C. Though the\\nrelatively short duration of this temperature series negates the identification of low\\nfrequency cycles via spectral analysis, there does appear to be a 15 year cycle\\noccurring in the data which is particularly evident in the May-Oct temperature series\\n(figure 3.21) and of a similar frequency to decadal periodicities reported by O\\'Sullivan\\net al., (2002). As with the long-term air temperature series in figure 3.13, the Millport\\ndata also shows a trend towards increased modern temperatures, with an overall\\nincrease of 0.177°C per decade. This rate of change is slightly greater than the change\\nseen in the SMT temperature series and this could, in part, be due to the short duration\\nof the Millport time series capturing late 20th Century warming.\\nA long-term (AD 1870 - 1999) record of sea surface temperature anomalies (SSTA)\\nfrom the grid 55°N - 60°N, 10°W - 05°W is presented in figure 3.22. The May-\\nOctober SSTA series shows a larger range of anomalies (-0.71 to +1.14 °C) than the\\nannual SSTA (-0.44 to +0.92 °C), though as with the Millport series, the data follow\\nsimilar long-term trends. Prior to 1925, temperatures generally appear to be cooler\\nthan the long-term mean whilst the period between 1925 and 1977 sees consistently\\npositive temperature anomalies. The greatest SSTA variability occurs after 1950\\nonwards and spectral analysis reveals periodicities of ~ 7.69 years (figure 3.22) which\\nare commonly associated with NAO cyclicity (e.g. O\\'Sullivan et al., 2002 and\\nreferences within).\\nTrends in the SSTA series correspond fairly well with trends in the SMT anomaly data\\nfor both the annual average temperature anomalies (r = 0.664, p = 0.0) and the May-\\nOctober temperature anomalies (r = 0.666, p = 0.0), exemplifying the modulation of\\nthe UK climate by oceanic heat transfer from the coastal waters (figure 3.23). The\\nSMT anomalies show greater variability than the SST data and this is likely due to the\\nhigher thermal intertia of the ocean water and the lower thermal inertia of the land\\nwhich results in rapid responses of air temperature to atmospheric forcing mechanisms\\nsuch as the NAO. Sea surface temperature anomaly data from the Faeroe-Shetland\\nChannel also show similar trends to the SMT data (figure 3.24) exemplifying the link\\n106\\nChapter 3 Climate and hydrography\\n15 years 15 years\\n1975\\nDate\\nFigure 3.21.

Though the SSTA data spans from AD 1870 - 1999 (with\\nmissing monthly data between 1870 and ~ 1919) this data series only shows\\nanomalies from a long-term mean temperature, rather than actual temperature data and\\nrepresents temperature anomalies from an \\'open coastal\\' location. However, the\\nMillport data series comprises actual temperature data rather than anomalies and\\nlikely represents a sheltered location (section 3.5.4) similar to the basin waters of\\nLoch Sunart.\\nA comparison of the annual average Millport temperatures with the annual average\\nSMT, SIT, NIT and CET series (table 3.4) shows the strongest correlation and best fit\\nbetween the marine and land temperature series comes from the SMT data set (r =\\n0.78 and R2 = 0.609).\\nMillport sea surface temperatures typically \\'lag\\' behind the SMT air temperatures\\n(e.g. figure 3.25a) by about 1 month, likely due to the ocean\\'s high thermal inertia and\\nradiative forcing of the ocean\\'s surface layer.

The\\nregression equation from this \\'lagged\\' relationship for the period AD 1953-2001 is:\\nmonthly MPT = 0.594* monthly SMT + 5.750 (R2 = 0.88) (Eq. 3.2)\\nwhere monthly MPT = averaged monthly Millport marine temperatures and monthly\\nSMT = averaged monthly Scottish Mainland air temperatures. The reconstructed\\nmonthly marine temperature series agrees fairly well with the observed Millport\\ntemperature data (figure 3.26). However, for the majority of the annual cycles, the\\nmonthly reconstruction either overestimates or under-estimates the marine\\ntemperature, resulting in a large error with the mean difference between the\\nreconstructed marine temperature and the observed Millport temperature being -0.29 x\\n10\"3 ± 1.41 °C, i.e. high mean accuracy but low monthly precision. This low precision\\nis likely due to differences in the heat capacity of land and ocean, with the SMT data\\ndisplaying a large seasonal temperature whilst the marine temperature has small\\nseasonal marine temperature range (figure 3.26). Additionally, there are noticeable\\ninter-annual differences between the reconstructed marine temperature record and the\\nobserved Millport record (figure 3.26).\\nAnother method of reconstructing a longer marine temperature series for the Scottish\\nwest coast is to use the annual average data. Despite the strengthening of the linear\\nrelationship when lagged data is used, correlation coefficients for the monthly SMT\\nand monthly Millport data appear strongest when no lag is applied, i.e. when SMT for\\nJune is correlated against the June Millport data (table 3.5). Since the annual average\\nSMT: annual average Millport temperature correlation is also strong (table 3.4), this\\nsuggests that a regression equation derived for a yearly average with no lag applied to\\nthe data is likely to reproduce a realistic reconstruction of annual sea surface\\ntemperatures.\\nThe regression equation derived from the correlation of annual average SMT data and\\nannual average Millport data from AD 1953 to 2001 is given by;\\nRMPT = 1.01*Annual average SMT + 2.75 (R2 = 0.61) (Eq. 3.3)\\n111\\nChapter 3 Climate and hydrography\\nTable 3.5 Pearson\\'s correlation coefficients ofmonthly Scottish mainland temperature (SMT) data\\n(columns) and Millport monthly marine temperatures (rows).

The\\nintercept of the regression equation accounts for the ~ 2°C difference between the air\\nand marine temperatures.\\nThe resulting reconstructed marine temperature series agrees well with the observed\\nannual average Millport marine temperatures, following the same general temperature\\ntrend (figure 3.27a). Although the reconstruction overestimates and underestimates\\nthe temperature at times, the mean difference between the observed and reconstructed\\ntemperatures is very low at 0.41 x 10\"5 °C, yielding an error of only 0.38 °C, which is\\nmuch lower than the error on the monthly data reconstruction.\\nThough benthic foraminifera typically calcify during May-October, the relationship\\nbetween Millport sea surface temperatures and the air temperature series over this\\nperiod are all weaker (table 3.4), thus using a May-October regression equation would\\nproduce a poor temperature reconstruction. However as figure 3.25b shows, the\\nannual and May- October Millport temperature data closely follow the same pattern\\nalbeit with a 2.02 ± 0.177 °C difference, thus the May-October average temperature\\ncould be estimated by adding 2.02 °C onto the reconstructed annual average marine\\ntemperature.\\nA problem in the reconstruction of the Millport temperature data is the long-term\\ntrend prevalent in the observed data. The regression equation for the observed\\nMillport data shows a 0.17 °C increase per decade whilst the SMT data for the same\\nperiod (AD 1953 - 2001) shows only a 0.083 °C warming per decade. This results in\\na temperature increase of 0.092 °C per decade for the reconstructed marine\\ntemperature for AD 1953 - 2001, i.e. the recent (AD 1953-2001) marine temperature\\ntrend observed at Millport is dampened of the reconstruction or marine temperature\\nover the same period. However, since the SMT data closely follow trends in both the\\nSSTA (figure 3.23) and Faeroe-Shetland Channel temperature series (figure 3.24), the\\nextended Millport temperature series and reconstruction is still likely to reflect broad\\nchanges in the North Atlantic climate (figure 3.27b) albeit with slightly exaggerated\\ntemperatures resulting in weaker long term temperature trends.\\n113\\nChapter 3 Climate and hydrography\\nDate\\nFigure 3.26.

This, together with\\nhigh annual precipitation (1600-3200 mm average precipitation band; U.K.\\nMeteorological Office data, 1977) results in low soil moisture deficits and the\\nmajority of precipitation falling onto the catchment area is therefore usually translated\\ninto surface runoff (Black & Cranston, 1995), as exemplified by the strong positive\\ncorrelation between Polloch precipitation and River Polloch mean daily flow (section\\n3.5.3). One significant exception to this rule is when precipitation falls as snow and\\nremains in the catchment until the spring melt.\\nThus, precipitation from the surrounding catchment is likely to enter Loch Sunart\\nrapidly and the mooring data from Loch Sunart demonstrates both the sensitivity and\\nrapid response of the inner basin salinity to varying inputs of freshwater (e.g. figure\\n3.20). Although DWREs in Loch Sunart are driven primarily by wind forcing\\n(Gillibrand et al., 1995), high freshwater inputs, by imparting buoyancy to the surface\\nlayer, appear to prevent or delay onsets of DWREs (figure 3.20). Therefore one\\nwould expect to see different hydrographic responses (particularly in the inner basin)\\nduring positive and negative phases of the NAO, with less frequent DWREs occurring\\nduring high river discharge years associated with the positive index of the NAO.\\n3.5.8 Modelling fjordic circulation\\nTo examine this hypothesis Gillibrand et al.,, (2005) modelled the fjordic circulation\\nin Loch Sunart during two extreme phases of the NAO; the positive index ( + 2.86)\\nyear 1988/89, and the negative index year of 1995/96 (-2.32; Jones et al., 1997).\\n115\\nChapter 3 Climate and hydrography\\nA two-dimensional laterally-averaged numerical model (which solved the\\nconservation of volume, momentum and salt in an estuary, vertical and eddy viscosity,\\nand diffusivity) with a staggered Cartesian grid using finite difference approximations\\nwas used to simulate the circulation in Loch Sunart during the two NAO extremes.\\nThe grid used in the model consisted of 19 grid columns and a maximum of 21 grid\\nrows. The model commenced from a specified initial condition and stepped forward\\nin 60 second increments with a \\'spin-up\\' period of 7 days allowing the model to\\nachieve equilibrium. Elliott et al.,, (1992) and Gillibrand et al.,, (1995) utilised the\\nsame model to successfully reproduce observed salinity fields and deep water renewal\\nevents in Loch Sunart and further details of the model mechanisms are described in\\nthese publications.\\n3.5.8.1 Model inputs\\nThe model was run for a full year over the two periods; 1) 1st August 1988 - 1st\\nAugust 1989 and 2) 1st August 1995 - 1st August 1996, to ensure that the winter\\nseason (when the NAO is the dominant mode of atmospheric behaviour) was\\ncaptured.\\nInputs to the model included along-channel wind-stress (data from Tiree), river\\ndischarge (scaled River Polloch mean daily flow data), surface elevation at the mouth\\nand salt input from the coastal ocean. Surface tidal elevation (data from Tobermory,\\nMull) was also accounted for (Gillibrand et al., 2005).\\nThere is a general dearth of data for Scottish river catchments and few Scottish\\ncatchments less than 50 km are gauged (Black & Cranston, 1995). River discharge\\ndata is not available for Loch Sunart, however the SEPA maintains a guage on the\\nRiver Polloch (in the neighbouring catchment to the north of Loch Sunart) which\\nmeasures mean daily flow (MDF).\\nAs mentioned previously, the Polloch precipitation: MDF relationship is strong (r =\\n0.779, p = 0.0), with periods of higher precipitation accompanied by greater mean\\ndaily flows. Since the Ariundle catchment experiences similar precipitation trends to\\nthe Polloch catchment (section 3.5.2) a similar precipitation: river discharge\\n116\\nChapter 3 Climate and hydrography\\nrelationship to the Polloch catchment (section 3.5.3) is also expected within the Sunart\\ncatchment area. It is recognised that differences in the physical characteristics of\\ncatchment areas, such as slope, soil development, geology and drainage patterns,\\nwould result in varying responses of river discharge to rainfall (Wolf, 1966), however\\nfor the purpose of this study, it is assumed that these neighbouring catchments behave\\nidentically (pers. comm., Dr. A. Black, 2001).\\nThe Loch Sunart catchment has a total area of 299 km (with numerous sub-\\ncatchments) and is much larger than the Polloch catchment area of 7.9 km . A simple\\nscaling approach was used to infer the mean daily flows of Sunart sub-catchment\\nrivers. The catchment and sub-catchment areas of Loch Sunart were delineated on an\\nOrdnance Survey map (Sheets 40, 49), and the areas of the sub-catchments were\\nestimated to the nearest 0.1 km2 (figure 3.28, table 3.6). Assuming no significant\\nprecipitation gradient across the Sunart catchment, and similar sub-catchment\\nhydrological responses, the Polloch MDF values were scaled to each sub-catchment,\\nusing the following relationship:\\nQesc = (Qpoiioch / Ap0n0Ch) * Asc (Eq. 3.4)\\nwhere Qesc represents the estimation of sub-catchment MDF (nF.s\"1), Qp0iioch\\nrepresents the Polloch MDF (m3.s_1), Ap0n0ch represents the Polloch catchment area\\n2 2\\n(km ) and Asc represents the area of the sub-catchment (km ). The mean river flow\\nvalues during the two simulation periods are shown in table 3.7.\\nHourly wind speed and direction data from Tiree was used in the model and the mean\\nwind speed and stress for the NAO extremes can be seen in table 3.7. Coastal salinity\\nwas held constant throughout the simulations, though salinity can change due to\\nclimatic forcing (e.g. Blindheim et al., 2000). This was partly due to a lack of data\\n(only one CTD profile available for the 12th July 1989) and partially to remove a\\nsource of variability from the modelling thereby focusing on hydrographic responses\\nto climatic wind stress and river discharge.\\n117\\nChapter 3 Climate and hydrography\\nFigure 3.28 A) Sub-catchment areas for streams and rivers discharging into Loch Sunart (A).

Gillibrand et al., (2005) report that the \\'influence of\\nthe NAO appears to be exerted primarily through the enhanced westerly winds which\\nare prevalent during the positive phase, rather than through the associated increased\\nprecipitation and river discharge\\'. Despite this, renewal events in the inner basin\\nduring the NAO positive year (1988-89) appear to occur in periods of low MDF (e.g.\\nthe renewal event around day 244 of the 1988-89 run), whilst a prolonged period of\\nhigher MDF between days 180 and 240 result in a delayed DWRE (figure 3.29a).\\nThis is also seen in the observed salinity record for Loch Sunart (figure 3.20).\\nAdditionally, the low discharge from around day 250 of the 1988-89 run results in a\\nlong period of relatively high salinity in the inner basin. The 1995-96 negative NAO\\nphase shows a decrease in inner basin salinity during or following periods of relatively\\nhigh MDF, however the duration of these MDF periods are short in comparison to the\\nperiods of low MDF, thus basin water is more regularly replaced, resulting in a higher\\nmean salinity (table 3.8).\\nThough the inflows into the main basin are very different for the positive and negative\\nNAO phase, the main basin salinity remains fairly constant for the runs during both\\nNAO years, with mean salinities of 34.18 and 34.16 respectively for the 1988/89 and\\n1995/96 runs (table 3.8). This variation in inflow, along with the increase in\\nfrequency of DRWE in the 1995/96 model run suggests a weak relationship between\\nmain basin bottom water salinity and the climatic forcing associated with the NAO.\\n119\\nChapter 3 Climate and hydrography\\nA 35.0\\n34.5\\n34.0\\n*c 33.5\\n33.0\\n32.5\\n32.0\\n31.5\\n+ve NAO (1988-89) Upper basinMain basin\\nPolloch MDF\\n50 100 150 200 250\\nDay of run\\n300 350\\n5.0 3\\nD\\njn\\n3\\n-ve NAO (1995-96)\\n35.0\\n34.5\\n34.0\\nc 33.5 -\\n33.0\\n32.5\\n32.0\\n31.5\\n150 200 250\\nDay of run\\n5.0 3\\nFigure 3.29 Modelling results for the inner basin salinity (black line) and main basin salinity (light\\ngrey line) of Loch Sunart during (A) an extreme positive NAO year (1988-89) and (B) an extreme\\nnegative NAO year (1995-96). The observed river discharge data (or mean daily flow, MDF) from\\nthe River Polloch (data from SEPA; shown in dark grey), scaled according to sub-catchment area,\\nwas used as an input into the model, and is included in this figure to illustrate the influence of\\nfreshwater input on inner basin salinity.\\n120\\nChapter 3 Climate and hydrography\\nGillibrand et al., (2005) point out that the relationships between basin salinity and low\\nfrequency (i.e. 30 day running mean) climatic wind stress and river discharge data is\\nmuch stronger than the relationship between salinity and daily discharge and wind\\ndata (table 3.9), particularly during the winter months when the NAO is most\\ndominant. The influence of climatic wind stress or river discharge on inner basin\\nsalinity is clearly demonstrated by strong correlations (table 3.9), whilst the much\\nweaker correlations for the main basin salinity support earlier suggestions that\\nclimatic wind stress or river discharge has little influence on the salinity in this basin.\\nThe NAO appears to significantly influence the inflow of water into both the main and\\ninner basins of Loch Sunart (table 3.8) however, the differing sensitivity of the basins\\nto the NAO and it\\'s associated weather or inputs is largely due to the differing sill\\ndepths of the two basins (figure 3.28). The inner basin sill is very shallow at 8 m\\nwater depth, thus inflowing water passing over the inner sill undergoes stronger\\nmixing than water flowing over the outer basin sill (~ 33 m water depth). This results\\nin the bottom water of the inner basin exhibiting characteristics similar to the surface\\nwater (which has been mixed at the sill and entrained into the inflowing deep water)\\nwhilst the main basin water retains the characteristics of source water seaward of the\\nsill due to less mixing of the surface water layer over the main sill (Gillibrand et al.,\\n2005).\\n3.5.8.3 Sensitivity analyses\\nSensitivity analyses were run on the model output for responses to modified wind\\nstress, freshwater discharge, coastal salinity boundary conditions and low frequency\\nclimatic influences (the anomaly produced in the mean strength of wind velocity due\\nto the NAO). A full description and discussion of the sensitivity analyses can be\\nfound in Gillibrand et al.,, (2005) but a summary is presented here.\\nResults from the river discharge sensitivity test showed no significant changes\\n(maximum salinity change of 0.03) in main or upper basin salinity even with large\\nmodifications, e.g. - 20% and + 35%.

Modified wind stress did have a noticeable\\neffect on the volume inflow with changes of 12% and 33% for the inner and main\\nbasins respectively, though these inflows were not marked by salinity changes. The\\nchange in volume inflow was probably due to enhanced estuarine circulation in the\\nfjord during increased east-west wind stress component. The climatic wind anomaly\\nsensitivity analysis suggested negligible changes in main basin salinity, with mean\\nsalinity variations of less than 0.02 when the low frequency climatic signal was\\nremoved. Although the inflow into the main basin appears to respond to changes in\\nthis climatic influence, the sensitivity analyses suggest little change in main basin\\nsalinity, which agrees well with the model outputs (section 3.5.8.2) and the observed\\nsalinity cycle in Loch Sunart (section 3.4.2).\\nThe inner basin on the other hand, shows a significant response to the removal of low\\nfrequency climatic signals (both wind stress and river discharge) with salinity\\nincreasing by ~ 0.38, the frequency of DWRE increasing by 30 days in the 1988/89\\nrun, whilst the 1995/96 run had a salinity decrease of 0.12 and a decrease of DRWE\\nfrequency (16 days).\\n3.5.8.4 Implications ofmodelling climatically forced circulation in fjords\\nEjordic circulation changes arising from climatic forcing are of particular interest to\\nbasin water quality and management issues, since many Scottish sea lochs host fish\\nfarms which are a major source of marine pollution (mainly via nutrient enrichment).\\nKnowledge of flushing times and hydrography are essential for monitoring the impact\\nof fish farms on the (often sensitive) sea loch environment (e.g. Gillibrand & Turrell,\\n1997). Lor example, Loch Sunart hosts a number fish farms including some in the\\ninner basin; a prolonged period of NAO positive winters may reduce the frequency of\\nDWREs in the inner basin, resulting in less flushing of \\'polluted\\' basin water.\\n123\\nChapter 3 Climate and hydrography\\nModelling the response of the Loch Sunart basins to climate forcing provides essential\\ninformation for the use of Loch Sunart sedimentary archives for palaeoenvironmental\\nreconstruction. Ottersen et al., (2001) show the NAO influences both terrestrial and\\nmarine ecology, whilst Nordberg et al., (2000) and Filipsson & Nordberg (2004)\\nreport a benthic foraminiferal assemblage response to the prevailing positive NAO\\nphase since the 1970s. Stable oxygen isotopes are often used in palaeoenvironmental\\nreconstructions (chapters 6 and 7) as an indicator of temperature changes. Both\\n1 8\\ntemperature and salinity can influence the 8 O of foraminiferal calcite thus\\n18\\ninterpretation of 8 O data can be difficult when an environment experiences both\\ntemperature and salinity fluctuations. However, the negligible influence of the NAO\\n1 Q\\non Loch Sunart main basin salinity suggests long 8 O records from fossil benthic\\nforaminifera are likely to represent temperature changes rather than salinity variations\\n(chapters 6 and 7). This would agree well with Austin & Inall (2002) who used a\\nregional salinity: S180 mixing line to calculate (using the palaeotemperature equation\\nof Bemis et al., 1998) the equilibrium calcite from observed Loch Etive temperature\\nt o\\nand salinity data. They concluded that the small impact of salinity on the 8 O of\\nwater results in the possibility of palaeotemperature reconstructions from the 8lsO of\\nforaminiferal calcite from Loch Etive and other Scottish sea lochs.\\n3.6 Conclusions\\nThe climate of the Loch Sunart catchment reflects the climate experienced by the\\nmajority of the Scottish mainland, which in turn is strongly influenced by coastal\\nwater temperatures via oceanic heat transfer and thermal inertia. These strong\\nrelationships allow the Millport marine temperature series to be extended back beyond\\nthe period of observation (AD 1953-2001) via the application of a regression equation\\nderived from the period of overlap between the Millport and Scottish mainland\\ntemperature (SMT) data. Observed daily temperatures in both the inner and main\\nbasin of Loch Sunart (40 m water depth) show a strong seasonal heating cycle, typical\\nof mid-latitude shelf seas, and the agreement of Loch Sunart marine temperatures with\\nMillport marine temperatures advocate the use of the Millport temperature series to\\nhindcast temperatures experienced by Loch Sunart basin waters. The similarity in\\ntemperature anomaly trends of the SMT data and the long-term sea surface\\n124\\nChapter 3 Climate and hydrography\\ntemperature (SSTA; HOLSMEER data) records suggests the reconstructed and\\nextended Millport marine temperature series is likely to reflect climate variability in\\nthe wider North Atlantic region. The extended marine temperature data can be used\\nfor direct comparison with the proxy derived palaeotemperature records obtained from\\nLoch Sunart (chapter 8).\\nNW Scotland temperature and precipitation records show clear responses to the North\\nAtlantic Oscillation, with NAO positive years yielding warmer and wetter winters,\\nwhilst cold and dry winters accompany negative NAO years. Given the importance of\\nclimatic parameters (such as wind stress and freshwater inputs ) to fjord hydrography\\n(e.g. Farmer & Freeland, 1983 and Gillibrand et al., 1995), the circulation of Loch\\nSunart basins are expected to show a response to the NAO. Salinity observations in\\nLoch Sunart over an annual cycle showed a clear response of inner basin salinity to\\nprecipitation received by the catchment (mirrored by freshwater inputs into the sea\\nloch). To test whether the Loch Sunart basin hydrography was significantly\\nmodulated by climatic influences during differing phases of the NAO, the circulation\\nof the inner and main basin was modelled using an existing circulation model (Elliott\\net al., 1992; Gillibrand et al., 1995) with along-channel wind stress, river discharge\\nand surface elevation at the loch mouth as inputs. Modelling results from the inner\\nbasin of Loch Sunart showed meteorological forcing during the positive NAO year\\n1988-89 resulted in less frequent deep water renewal events, greater salinity\\nvariability and a lower annual mean salinity (by 0.52) than for the negative NAO year.\\nThe NAO appeared to have little influence on main basin salinity, despite significant\\nvariations in the inflow of water into the basin. The modelling results agreed well\\nwith the observed basin hydrographic responses to freshwater inputs. The implication\\nof negligible inter-annual salinity variations in the main basin of Loch Sunart, along\\nwith the report of minor salinity influences on the 8lsO of Loch Etive water during\\nrenewal events (using the Loch Sunart S180: salinity relationship; Austin & Inall,\\n2002) suggests the main basin of Loch Sunart may provide an ideal location for\\nresolving high resolution palaeotemperature records from fossil benthic foraminiferal\\n8lsO calcite.\\n125\\nChapter 4 Marine reservoir ages in Scottish coastal waters\\nChapter 4 - Marine reservoir ages in Scottish Coastal Waters\\n4.1 Introduction\\nOrganisms living in the terrestrial biosphere generally exhibit 14C concentrations\\nwhich are in equilibrium with the atmospheric 14C due to rapid gaseous exchange\\nduring life processes (section 2.7). Conversely, marine organisms typically deposit\\ntheir carbonate shells in isotopic equilibrium with seawater (Mook & Vogel, 1968),\\nderiving carbon from the surrounding seawater, thus their 14C concentration will\\nreflect the 14C concentration of the seawater in which they live. Restricted\\nreplenishment of 14C across the well mixed surface ocean-atmospheric boundary\\nresults in ocean water becoming deficient in 14C relative to the atmosphere, therefore\\nmarine organisms exhibit an \\'apparent age\\' (section 2.7).\\nThe 14C deficiency of a water mass represents it\\'s reservoir age, R(t), which can be\\ndetermined by comparing measured marine l4C ages with contemporaneous\\natmospheric 14C ages (figure 4.1 and section 2.7), and should be applied to\\nconventional marine radiocarbon dates in order to correct for growth in a different\\ncarbon reservoir (Stuiver et al., 1986). Though the modelled global surface ocean\\nreservoir age (R*) is taken to be 400 years, with a AR equal to zero (Stuiver &\\nBraziunas, 1993), marine reservoir ages can vary geographically (e.g. Berkman &\\nForman, 1996; Facorellis et al., 1998; Siani et al., 2000; Yoneda et al., 2000). A more\\naccurate way to correct sample 14C ages for regional marine radiocarbon reservoir\\neffects is to subtract AR from the measured 14C age prior to using the marine\\ncalibration curve for calibration, where AR is defined as the difference between a\\nmeasured marine l4C age and the global model 14C curve of the surface ocean (R,\\ntaken from the Marine98 radiocarbon calibrations curve, Stuiver et al., 1998 ), i.e.:\\nAR = measured 14C age - R (Eq. 4. 1)\\nModern marine reservoir ages may be determined by radiocarbon dating;\\ni) marine carbonate material obtained live and with a known collection date\\nprior to 1950 AD i.e., pre-bomb samples (e.g..

To clarify the terminology appertaining\\nto radiocarbon reservoir ages: i) R(t) = the marine radiocarbon reservoir age which is determined\\nby calculating the difference between the measured 14C age of a marine sample and a contemporaneous\\nterrestrial (wood) sample representing the atmospheric 14C value; ii) R* = the modelled global\\nsurface ocean reservoir age applied to all marine radiocarbon ages. This value represent open ocean\\nconditions and equates to ~ 400 years, where AR = 0; iii) AR = the regional deviation of a marine 14C\\nsample from the model curve (R*) of the surface ocean.\\n127\\nChapter 4 Marine reservoir ages in Scottish coastal waters\\nii) paired marine-terrestrial samples e.g.. wood and shell material, (e.g..

Since different water masses from the seas surrounding the UK are likely\\nto exhibit difference AR tendencies, and AR may be affected by a latitudinal effect\\n(e.g. Mangerud, 1975), it is possible that the AR value for the west coast of Scotland\\ndiffers from the regional UK average.\\nThe sea lochs of NW Scotland exhibit fjordic circulation (e.g. chapter 3) i.e. they have\\na restricted connection with open coastal waters and high freshwater inputs often\\nresult in brackish surface waters, which can dilute the salinity of bottom water masses.\\nAn important characteristic of fjord circulation are periodic deep water renewal events\\n(DWREs; previously discussed in section 1.8.2 and chapter 3). The 14C/12C ratios of\\nfreshwater systems in igneous areas (such as NW Scotland) should be similar to that\\nof the atmosphere (Broecker & Walton, 1959) and are unlikely to be influenced by\\n\\'hard water effects\\' from the surrounding bedrock geology (e.g. Heier-Nielsen et al.,\\n1995b). Additionally, Austin & Inall (2002) exemplified how DWREs could\\ninfluence the isotopic composition of fjord water and a freshwater influence has been\\nsuggested. The significant influence of freshwater in fjordic hydrography suggests\\nthat Scottish fjords may exhibit younger marine reservoir ages than the 405 ± 40 years\\nestimated for the coastal waters of the UK (Harkness, 1983). Reimer et al., (2002)\\nreport a AR value of -33 ± 93 14C years for the coastal waters of Ireland, Scotland and\\nthe Orkney Isles during the mid to late Holocene, whilst Ascough et al., (2004)\\nreported a AR of -79 ± 17 l4C years for N and W Scottish coastal waters at\\napproximately 2000 yr BP.\\n128\\nChapter 4 Marine reservoir ages in Scottish coastal waters\\nDifferences in sea loch bathymetries, i.e. sill and basin depths and freshwater inputs\\n(Edwards & Sharpies, 1986), mean that sea lochs typically exhibit varying\\nhydrography. For example, the frequency of DWREs and salinity of basin water\\n(Edwards & Sharpies, 1986; Gillibrand et al., 1995; Gillibrand et al., 1996; Allen &\\nSimpson, 1998; Austin & Inall, 2002) will vary and likely show different R(t)\\nresponses (e.g. table 4.1). Despite these differences, an average AR value for Scottish\\nsea lochs would be useful when constructing chronologies for sedimentary archives\\nfrom these unique environments.\\n4.2 Project aims and hypothesis; calculating AR values of NW Scottish coastal\\nwaters\\nThe \\'apparent\\' age of marine carbonates from sea loch environments could be affected\\nby the following;\\na) the degree of exchange with the coastal waters via typical fjordic circulation\\ne.g. DWREs (section 1.8.2). Over longer time-scales, sea-level changes due to\\nthe post-glacial isostatic rebound of the land will act to modify these exchange\\nprocesses because of the critical importance of mixing over the sill regions\\n(section 1.8.2). For example, Shennan et al., (1995) report an isostatic sea\\nlevel rise of approximately 2 m during the last 2,000 years BP in NW\\nScotland.\\nb) Variations in the amount of precipitation and wind strength/direction\\nexperienced by the catchment area are also known to impact upon sea loch\\ncirculation (chapter 3; Gillibrand et al., 1995; Gillibrand et al., 2005), with\\nmore frequent DWRE resulting in more saline bottom waters. Such changes in\\nsalinity are likely to affect the AR of the sea loch because they reflect the\\nmixing processes between coastal and fjordic water masses.\\nThe hypothesis of variable AR values in Scottish sea lochs is tested using two\\napproaches;\\n1. By radiocarbon dating marine mollusc shells (obtained from the National\\nMuseum of Scotland, Edinburgh) collected on known dates prior to 1950 AD\\n(e.g. Mangerud, 1972, Harkness, 1983 and Heier-Nielsen et al., 1995a) to\\nprovide a means of determining local reservoir age and regional AR of sites\\n129\\nTable4.1DeterminationofregionalARvaluesf rthN rthE stl cshelfegion.

The dates obtained range from 347 ± 39 14C years\\nBP to 554 ± 35 14C years BP (table 4.2). Weighted means were used to obtain a more\\nrealistic measure of a set of values, since they are skewed towards the mode of the\\ndata set rather than the median, and therefore the average will not be \\'pulled\\' by\\nsingularly anomalous results;\\nWeighted average, ra = 2 (x / a2) / £ (1 / a2) (Eq. 4.2)\\nwhere x is the 14C age and o is the 14C age error.\\nThe weighted average radiocarbon age of the samples including the Loch Creran\\nsample (AAR-7489) is 444 ± 14 14C years BP and 458 ± 15 14C years when the Loch\\nCreran sample is excluded.

The AR values from this study range\\nfrom a mean value of -124 ± 39 to +67 ± 35 14C years. The weighted AR value for the\\nsamples excluding the average AR of the Loch Creran sample is -11 ± 14 years, and -\\n25 ± 14 years when an averaged AR for the Loch Creran sample is included. Initially\\nthere appears to be significant variation between the AR values, however figure 4.4\\nshows that the 2 o error bars of all samples intersect the 2 a error bar of the weighted\\naverage AR = -11 ± 14 years, suggesting that the difference between the data is\\ninsignificant (pers comm., Prof. J. Heinemeier, 2001). The fact that the AR values fall\\nwithin the acceptable limits of the weighted average suggests that all data can be\\nincluded in a regional average (Harkness, 1983).\\nThe mean 14C age of the two samples from Oban (samples AAR-7419 and AAR-\\n7420) fall within the error bars of the dates. A simple statistical method (where At is\\nthe difference between the two dates and St is the combined standard deviation of the\\nmean corresponding to the two dates) shows that At < St and therefore there is no\\nsignificant difference between the two Oban dates (Nemec, 2003). The lack of same\\nspecies data negates the possibility of investigating species-specific vital effects,\\nhowever, the similarity in the dates suggests that vital effects are not a major influence\\nin the uptake of radiocarbon. If this is the case, these data support the suggestion that\\nvariance in AR values reflect environmental influences, not vital effects (Keith et al.,\\n1964).\\n4.3.2 Stable isotopic composition of the historically collected shells\\nThe b13C and 8lsO measurements for the museum shells are shown in table 4.2 and\\nalso in figures 4.8 and 4.9. The S13C values range from 0.75 to 2.85 %c, with a mean\\nvalue of 1.85 ± 0.68 which is within the range quoted for marine shells (Keith et al.,\\n1964 and Olsson & Osadebe, 1974). The 5180 values range from 0.56 to 2.74 %c with\\n18 c* 13\\na mean value of 1.96 ± 0.77 %c. A linear correlation between 5 O and 5 C suggests\\na moderate positive relationship (r = 0.403; R2 = 16%) insignificant at a 95%\\nconfidence level (p = 0.370), which may be due to the low sample number.\\nLinear correlations between the AR values and the isotope values show:\\n13\\na) no significant correlation (r = -0.196, p = 0.674) with respect to 5 C.\\n136\\nChapter 4 Marine reservoir ages in Scottish coastal waters\\nb) A moderate correlation (r = -0.506, p = 0.247) with S180, significant at 85%.\\nAn R2 value of 0.31 suggests approximately 31% of the variation in AR can be\\nexplained by variation in 8lsO.\\nThe hypothesis presented in section 4.2 proposes that shell carbonate from sea lochs\\nwith infrequent DWREs and thus environments of reduced basin water salinity, are\\nlikely to exhibit \\'younger\\' marine radiocarbon reservoir ages than *R due to the\\ncontinuous input of \\'new\\' I4C from precipitation. Therefore, one would expect\\ndepleted 8lsO values (reflecting freshwater input) to be accompanied by negative AR,\\ni.e. a positive AR: 8180 relationship. However, the negative AR: 8lsO relationship for\\nthe historically collected museum shell data may be due to a low sample numbers (n =\\n18\\n7) rather than a true representation of basin salinity influence (represented by 8 O) on\\nthe AR values of marine carbonates from Scottish coastal waters.\\n4.4 Results from paired 14C dated samples (terrigeneous plant and marine\\nshell material)\\nRegional 14C deviations (AR values) can be calculated by subtracting the I4C date of\\nterrestrial material from the 14C date of contemporaneous marine material (e.g. Siani\\net al., 2000; Reimer et al., 2002; Ascough et al., 2004). Plant fragments and marine\\nshell material were obtained for AMS dating from the same sediment depth from\\ncores SC102 (Sholkovitch core from Loch Sunart) and GC008 (gravity core from\\nLoch Etive). C/N analyses were carried out on the material prior to dating to ascertain\\nthe provenance of the material, i.e. whether it was terrigeneous or marine.\\nThe C/N ratios (table 4.3) and the 813C isotope values (table 4.4) of the organic\\nfragments (samples GC008-95 and SC102-68) found in the sea loch sediment cores\\nsuggest that they are of terrestrial origin, with C/N ratios falling within the expected\\nrange of 17-30 (Middleburg & Nieuwenhuize, 1998). However, the C/N ratios of the\\nfine fraction organic material (from hereon referred to as residues) from samples\\nGC008-26 and GC008-35, suggest a marine provenance for the organic matter (e.g.\\nThornton & McManus, 1994), hence they are not suitable for investigating reservoir\\nages.\\n137\\nChapter 4 Marine reservoir ages in Scottish coastal waters\\nThe 14C measurements of the paired samples are presented in table 4.4. The §13C\\nvalues of samples GC008-95 and SC102-68 fall within the range of land plants (e.g.\\nMiddleburg & Nieuwenhuize, 1998), thus confirm the results of the C/N ratios, which\\nsuggest a terrestrial origin.\\nThe marine radiocarbon reservoir age, R(t), can be calculated using paired samples by\\nsubtracting the calibrated atmospheric radiocarbon age of the plant from the\\nuncalibrated radiocarbon date of the marine carbonate data. The paired samples\\nsuggest a R(t) of -1068 ±111 cal years for Loch Etive and a R(t) of 266 ± 42 cal years\\nfor Loch Sunart.\\nThe paired samples from Loch Etive suggest a large negative sign for the radiocarbon\\nreservoir age since the plant sample is older than the marine carbonate sample,\\ntherefore they cannot be used to reliably determine the marine reservoir ages.\\nBotanical inspection (by Dr. E. Warncke) of the plant remains suggested no evidence\\nof charring or long-term peat bog residency (pers. comm., Dr. E. Warncke, 2002).\\nTherefore the data may possibly yield information on the input time of terrigeneous\\nmaterial entering the sea loch from the surrounding catchment area, with a possible\\n\\'retention\\' time of approximately 1000 years inferred. Bioturbation is a potential\\nproblem which must be considered when dealing with marine sediment cores. Lead\\nand caesium data (chapter 8) suggest some degree of bioturbation in cores GC023\\n(Sunart) and GC008 (Etive); a process which might act to displace contemporaneous\\nfossil material from its stratigraphic context. However, bottom water in Loch Etive\\noften becomes low in oxygen (due to infrequent deep-water renewals events) and has\\nbeen known to reach anoxia, therefore the disparity between the data is unlikely to\\nhave been caused by bioturbation.\\nTheoretically, the AR value for Loch Sunart can be calculated from the paired\\nsamples, since the marine sample has an older (apparent) radiocarbon age than the\\nterrestrial material, and the estimated calendar age of the terrestrial plant sample can\\nbe determined through calibration using the \\'INTCAL98\\' curve (Stuiver et ai,\\n1998a). The marine radiocarbon age from the \\'marine98\\' curve for that year is then\\nsubtracted from the uncalibrated measured marine radiocarbon date, to give AR for\\nthat location. The calibrated age of the plant sample is 145 ± 145 cal yr BP (i.e. ~ AD\\n138\\nChapter 4 Marine reservoir ages in Scottish coastal waters\\n1805), and the uncalibrated marine radiocarbon age (from the \\'marine98\\' curve) for\\nAD 1805 is 532.7 ± 4 14C years BP. Therefore, assuming the shell and the plant\\nsample are contemporaneous, the AR value for Loch Sunart in this period is\\napproximately -121.7 ± 149 years.\\nIn reality there are serious inherent calibration problems in the case of the Loch Sunart\\nsample. The atmospheric calibration curve suggests that there is a 95.4% probability\\nthat the calendar age of the Loch Sunart plant sample is 145 ± 145 cal yr BP, which\\nequates to AD 1805 on the calendar scale. However, the measured radiocarbon age\\nfalls with the recent radiocarbon calibration plateau which began at ~AD 1700\\nextending to the limits of dating, resulting in a multi-modal probability distribution for\\nthe calibrated date (figure 4.5). The large error bar for the mean date of 145 ± 145 cal\\nyr BP at 95.4% probability is a function of the large probability distribution under this\\nsection of the curve. Within the 68.2% probability calibration range, the mean date of\\n145 ± 145 cal yr BP (at 95.4% probability) actually falls within a section of the\\ncalibration curve with a low (6%) probability. The true calender age cannot be\\naccurately determined for single samples falling within such a radiocarbon plateau.\\nThe calibrated age of sample AAR-7493 is unlikely to be 145 cal yr BP, rather it may\\nfall within the limits of a higher probability mode such as the 25.1% section,\\ncorresponding to 230-170 cal BP. Irrespective of this speculation, the nature of the\\ncalibration results for the Loch Sunart organic sample (AAR- 7493) implies that these\\ndata should not be used to determine marine reservoir ages. Therefore, in the absence\\nof further paired terrestrial marine data, these results will not be discussed further.\\n4.5 Discussion\\n4.5.1 Regional AR for the West coast of Scotland\\nThe weighted averaged measured radiocarbon age for all the samples including the\\nLoch Creran sample is 444 ± 14 years, and 458 ± 15 years excluding the Loch Creran\\nsample.

Harkness highlighted samples SRR-170 (a+b) and SRR-356(b) as falling\\noutwith the acceptable statistical variance (2o) for the group\\'s mean apparent age of\\n405 ±40 years. These samples have not been immediately rejected since the data used\\nhere is not from the Harkness (1983) publication but rather the recalculated\\nradiocarbon ages from Reimer (2004; http://radiocarbon.pa.qub.ac.uk/marine/refs/\\n132.html, hereon referred to as Reimer, 2004). The Harkness data from Reimer\\n(2004) shows younger apparent ages than the dates from Harkness (1983) as they have\\nbeen corrected for isotopic fractionation.\\nThe Harkness weighted reservoir age for the Scottish west coast samples is 460 ± 13\\n14C years BP, and individual reservoir ages can be seen along with the data from this\\nstudy in figure 4.6. Out of the 9 samples, 6 samples show negative AR values, with\\nsamples SRR-356a, SRR-356b and SRR-357b exhibiting positive AR values greater\\nthan ~ 70 ± 33 years (table 4.5). Harkness (1983) dated the inner and outer parts of\\nthe shell separately, and also dated the periostracum of the Pinna fragilis shell (sample\\nSRR-710-c). Keith et al., (1964) obtained a mean 513C variation of 0.73%c between\\nthe outer and inner shell material (which they attributed to variations in carbon uptake\\nbetween the shell\\'s internal and external environments) and the mean 813C variation\\nfrom the Harkness data agrees well at 0.27 ± 0.22%c.\\nThe AR results from the differing shell parts generally fall within the standard\\ndeviation limits of each other (table 4.5; figure 4.7), with the exception of the\\nperiostracum data (SRR-710-c) and the Loch Broom sample (SRR-356) which are\\nstatistically significantly different. The periostracum of sample SRR-710-c has a 513C\\n1 T\\nvalue of -16.5%o; 12.7%c different to the inner/outer shell mean 5 C. Periostracum is\\n13\\nan organic layer formed from proteinaceous material, hence it is unlikely to yield 5 C\\nvalues similar to the inorganic carbon in CaCCL. Results of sample SRR-710-c have\\nbeen excluded from relationships requiring 513C as a variable, however the 14C age of\\nthis sample has been included in the weighted averages since Harkness (1983) does\\n141\\nChapter 4 Marine reservoir ages in Scottish coastal waters\\nTable 4.5 Recalculated measured radiocarbon ages, marine reservoir ages and AR values for the\\nHarkness (1983) shells from the Scottish west coast.

The Loch Broom samples have similar 8 C values (table 4.5) and one\\nwould expect similar 14C concentrations (Craig, 1953). All the shells used in this\\nstudy and by Harkness (1983) were whole valves with no visual signs of deterioration,\\nsuch as a powdery surface common as a result of recrystallisation processes (Aitken,\\n1990). Mangerud (1972) suggests material yielding 813C values isotopically lighter\\nthan -3%c should be checked for signs of possible contamination but notes that it is\\nimpossible to separate a contamination effect from influence of brackish or freshwater\\n1 T\\n5 C at the time of shell formation. Additionally, Harkness (1983) did not mention the\\nLoch Broom samples as being problematic. It is possible that the large difference in\\n14C ages for the outer and inner fractions of Dosinia exoleta could be a species-\\nspecific effect related to food availability, shell structure and the isotopic\\ndisequilibrium within the organism\\'s internal carbon pool (e.g. Reimer et al., 2002).\\nThe Loch Broom sample has been included in the study since the averaged value falls\\nwithin the acceptable 2o statistical limits of the weighted average AR (figure 4.7).\\nThe averaged Harkness AR data for the whole shell are presented along with the data\\nfrom this study in figure 4.7. The combined Cage and Harkness (hereon denoted by\\nC&H) data show a weighted average AR value of -11 ± 10 I4C years, including an\\naveraged AR value for the Loch Creran sample. A Student t-test was used to test for\\nsignificant difference between the mean AR found in this study and the mean found\\nfrom Harkness\\'s data (Davis, 2002). The following variation of the Student t-test\\nfunction was used since the null hypothesis was accepted in the Snedecor F-test (with\\nS2 representing the variance of the means);\\nF = S,2/S22 (Eq. 4.3)\\nt = x, - x2 / V S2 (1/m + l/n2) (Eq. 4.4)\\nwhere x is the mean, n is the number of samples and S is the pooled variance of the\\nindividual variances of the means being tested, calculated by;\\nS2 = (m - 1) Si2 + (n2 - 1) S22 / m + n2 - 2 (Eq. 4.5)\\n144\\nChapter 4 Marine reservoir ages in Scottish coastal waters\\nThe Student t-test shows that the AR value (including Loch Creran) of -25 ±14 years\\nfrom this study is not statistically different at 95 % confidence to the combined C&H\\nAR value but they are different at an 85 % confidence level.\\nThe AR value of the C&H data is likely to be pulled more towards 0 by the inclusion\\nof the Hunterson Sands sample (SRR-356) (table 4.5). Hunterston Sands is located\\nnear the mouth of the Firth of Clyde (figure 4.2) so one might expect to see less\\nnegative AR values due to a greater influence of \\'older\\' coastal waters. However, as\\nHarkness (1983) points out, the Hunterston Sands and Skelmorlie Bank samples may\\nhave been influenced by pollution, since organic wastes (containing modern 14C and\\n14C-free residues) were being dumped in the Clyde Sea at the time of the collection\\nperiod (1920). Since the Hunterston Sands sample (SRR-356) is the only sample to\\nlie outwith the acceptable statistical variance (2o) of the data\\'s weighted average AR\\n(see figure 4.7), and it\\'s validity of truly representing the natural regional AR is in\\ndoubt, it has been omitted from the west Scottish weighted average. Therefore, the\\nnew calculated weighted average of AR for C/H is -27 ±11 years.\\nThe Student t-test (Eq 4.3) (with the null hypothesis accepted in the F-test) shows that\\nthe C&H AR value of -27 ±11 years is statistically different (at 99.5% confidence) to\\nthe AR value of 14 ± 13 years quoted by Harkness (1983, data from Reimer, 2000) for\\nUK coastal waters, with the coastal and fjord waters of the Scottish west coast\\nyielding significantly more negative AR values. The likelihood that this AR value of\\n-27 ±11 years is a reliable estimate is supported by being statistically similar to the\\nAR value of -33 ± 93 years recently quoted by Reimer et al., (2002) for the region\\nencompassing west Ireland, Scotland and the Orkney Islands. However, the AR\\npresented here is statistically different to the AR of -79 ± 17 years reported by\\nAscough et al., (2004). This may be due to temporal differences or differences in\\nmethods. Bondevik et al., (1999) also reported a marine reservoir age of 380 ± 32\\nyears (AR = -20) for the west coast of Norway. Therefore, a correction of AR = -27 ±\\n11 years can be applied to marine radiocarbon ages from the NW coast of Scotland.\\n145\\nChapter 4 Marine reservoir ages in Scottish coastal waters\\n4.5.2 Stable isotopes, regional hydrography and AR\\nThe sea lochs of NW Scotland exhibit fjordic circulation (e.g. Farmer & Freeland,\\n1983) i.e. they have a restricted connection with open marine water masses (Atlantic\\nOcean) and high freshwater inputs often result in brackish surface waters, which can\\ndilute the salinity of bottom water masses. Positive relationships between salinity and\\nthe stable isotopic composition (5lsO and 513C) of shell material has been reported by\\nmany authors (e.g. Lloyd, 1964; Mook & Vogel, 1968; Mook, 1971), with isotopically\\nheavier values occurring in more saline water masses. Spiker (1980) found that 813C\\nand A14C in estuarine waters exhibit a conservative mixing relationship between river\\nand ocean water end-members, again with isotopically heavier S13C and AUC values\\noccurring in high to mid salinity waters.\\nBroecker & Walton, 1959 suggested that river-water bicarbonate in igneous areas\\nshould have a 14C/12C ratio close to that of atmospheric 14C/12C. The bedrock geology\\nof NW Scotland is predominantly igneous, and the thin and poorly developed soils\\noverlying the steep slopes rapidly translate rainfall into surface runoff (Black &\\nCranston, 1995). The freshwater inputs into the loch should therefore be relatively\\nunaffected by 14C deficient carbon derived from humus and instead have 14C activities\\nclose to that of atmospheric CO2.\\nThe less saline fjordic waters may \\'leak\\' out into coastal regions where they are\\nreadily mixed, and the tendency towards negative AR values around the west Scotland\\ncoast likely reflects the degree of mixing between \\'older\\' fully marine Atlantic waters\\nand \\'younger\\', slightly less saline coastal waters (Harkness, 1983). Additionally,\\nsurface waters in the NE Atlantic tend to be isotopically (513C) lighter (by\\napproximately 1 %c) than expected due to the penetration of anthropogenic CO2 in this\\nregion of deep water formation (Keir et al., 1998). The mixing of \\'young\\' water with\\n\\'old\\' water in this region may also cause negative AR values particularly in historical\\nshells collected in the early 1900s (i.e. pre-bomb).\\nThe stable isotope data presented in this study come from different mollusc species.\\n1T\\nDespite this, Keith et al., (1964), for example, found that major variations in the 5 C\\nvalues of marine molluscs were controlled by environmental variables, not by species-\\nspecific vital effects. Therefore this study assumes that vital effects between species\\n146\\nChapter 4 Marine reservoir ages in Scottish coastal waters\\nare minimal, and that AR values, like stable isotope values, are influenced by\\nenvironmental conditions. This inference is supported by the 14C data from Oban\\nwhich shows statistically similar 14C reservoir ages from two different bivalve species\\n(table 4.2).\\nBi-plots of S180 and 513C often exhibit positive linear relationships (e.g Mook, 1971)\\nand data from this study also shows a moderate insignificant positive correlation ( r =\\n0.403, p = 0.370). Positive trends between salinity and the stable isotope composition\\n1 O 1 o\\nof shell carbonate (5 O and 5 C) have been seen in previous studies (e.g. Mook &\\nVogel, 1968), and Keith et al., (1964) suggest that S13C variations are not as affected\\nby fractionation process as the temperature dependent oxygen isotopes. Therefore, it\\nis likely that 8180 and 813C variations in Scottish west coast shells reflect the\\nadmixture of isotopically light 8I3C and 8lsO from freshwater inputs with the\\nrelatively isotopically enriched coastal water 813C and 8lsO.\\nAssuming the shell 813C (and Sl80) data reflects the degree of mixing between fjord\\nand coastal water around NW Scotland, and given the reported relationships between\\nsalinity and 14C observed by Spiker (1980), one may expect to see similar patterns in\\nAR from sea lochs. However, the relationship between shell isotopic composition and\\nAR must first be examined before relationships between AR and hydrography can be\\ninvestigated any further.\\n4.5.3 Stable oxygen isotopic composition and AR\\nSalinity mixing lines (eg. Epstein & Mayeda, 1953; Mikalsen & Sejrup, 2000; Austin\\n1 o\\n& Inall, 2002) demonstrate a depletion in 8 Owater with decreasing salinity. This\\nrelationship should also be observed in marine shells since they tend to be in isotopic\\nequilibrium with surrounding water (Mook & Vogel, 1968; Olsson & Osadebe, 1974).\\nBoth temperature and salinity affect the isotopic composition of calcium carbonate\\n(e.g. Bemis et al., 1998) however, these data are not known for the sample locations or\\ntime of collection for the museum shells. The data presented here suggests a moderate\\nnegative and insignificant relationship (probably due to low sample numbers; r =\\n-0.506, p = 0.247) between 8180 and AR, with 26 % of the variation in AR being\\nexplained by variations in 8lsO (fig 4.8). Coastal and fjordic waters often have\\n147\\nChapter 4 Marine reservoir ages in Scottish coastal waters\\nstratified water columns, hence salinity and temperature differences occur with depth\\nand mixing. Since the role of temperature is significant in the fractionation of oxygen\\nt o\\nisotopes (e.g. Bemis et al., 1998 and references therein), the 5 O results alone cannot\\nbe used to confirm the influence of freshwater mixing upon the shell composition.\\n4.5.4 Stable carbon isotopic composition and AR\\nThe 813C:salinity relationship is typically positive, i.e. 513C becomes isotopically\\nheavier in more saline waters (Lloyd, 1964; Mook & Vogel, 1968; Mook, 1971;\\n1 o\\nSpiker, 1980; Polyak et al., 2003). Marine water bicarbonates typically have 5 C\\nvalues from -2 %c to +1.5 %c (e.g. Keith et al., 1964 and Mook, 1971) with surface\\n1\\nmarine waters generally showing little variability in 5 C (Mook & Vogel, 1968).\\nRiver-water bicarbonate tends to have S13C values close to the 813C of atmospheric\\nCO2 (~ -7 %c) with 5I3C values typically around -8 to -12 %c (e.g. Keith et al., 1964,\\nMook, 1971 Spiker, 1980 and Matson & Brinson, 1990). Inputs of carbon derived\\nfrom land plants and stable organic residues from peat or humus with isotopically\\nlight S13C values (~ -25 to -30 %c) into relatively small freshwater reservoirs such as\\n1 T\\nrivers may further influence river water 8 C (e.g. Keith & Anderson, 1963). Brackish\\nand \\'peaty\\' surface waters were observed in the upper basin of Loch Sunart during\\nresearch cruises, and though bottom waters are likely to be more saline (chapter 3),\\nthere is a potential for basin water 813C to be modified by the isotopically light 813C\\nfrom freshwater inputs (Keith et al., 1964).\\nMarine molluscs typically deposit their carbonate shell in isotopic equilibrium with\\nthe surrounding environment, ie. the 813Ccarbonate reflects S13Cwater, (Mook & Vogel,\\n1968). Shell S13C values range from -15.1 %C to -2.1 %c for freshwater molluscs, and\\nfrom -1.7 %c to +4.2 %c for marine environments and intermediate salinity waters (i.e.\\nsalinity less than 30) typically show more depleted values (Keith et al., 1964; Mook &\\nVogel, 1968). The 813C values presented here range from -0.2 to 4.1 %c (see tables 4.2\\nand 4.5) suggesting little brackish water influence on the shell isotopic composition\\nduring calcification (Keith et al., 1964 and Mook, 1971). Mangerud (1972) reported a\\n1 T\\nsimilar range of \\'typical marine 8 C\\' values for molluscs from Norwegian fjords.\\n11\\nHowever, a positive relationship between shell 8 C and depth (where salinity\\nincreases due to fjordic circulation) led him to suggest that the isotopically depleted\\n148\\nChapter 4 Marine reservoir ages in Scottish coastal waters\\n513C values from shallow water shells do reflect the admixing of freshwater and\\nfjordic water in the surface layers.\\n1 ^\\nIt is thought that the metabolic pathway is important in governing 5 C in mollusc\\nshells (Wilbur, 1960), particularly in the inner nacreous layers which may reflect the\\ninternal environments of the shells. Reimer et al., (2002) point out that molluscan\\nfeeding habits are important when interpreting 513C (and therefore AUC) data since\\nthis determines how carbon enters the organism. For example filter feeders obtain\\ncarbon directly from the seawater in the form of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC),\\nwhereas deposit feeders may utilise old organic carbon from detritus. The shells used\\nin this study were all bivalve filter feeders, hence they should derive their carbon\\ndirectly from seawater dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC). Carbon may be derived\\nfrom sources other than the seawater such as CO2 from benthic respiration (Spiker,\\n1980) and fermentive muds. Both of these are typically depleted in 813C with respect\\nto marine carbonate values (Keith & Anderson, 1963), hence marine organisms\\ncalcifying in such environments may not deposit shell material in isotopic equilibrium\\nwith the seawater. Sediments from sea lochs can often be quite gaseous (e.g. Howe et\\nal., 2002) and care must be taken when 14C dating shells from such an environment.\\n1 ^\\nHowever, the 5 C data reported in this study (tables 4.2 and 4.5) suggest that the shell\\nmaterial were not unduly influenced by these external carbon sources, and likely\\nrepresent the 513C of the surrounding environment.\\nn\\nThe 5 C: AR relationship for data generated from this study was weak and\\ninsignificant (r = -0.196, p = 0.674; section 4.3.2) and the combined C&H S13C\\n(excluding sample SRR-356) also delivers a weak and insignificant 813C: AR\\nrelationship (r = -0.413; p = 0.16; figure 4.9), which may be due to the relatively low\\nsample number (n =13). Spiker (1980) reported that 813C and A14C in estuarine waters\\nexhibit conservative mixing between the river and ocean water end-members, with\\nisotopically heavier 813C in high and mid salinity waters. Assuming the shell S13C\\n(and S180) data reflects the degree of admixing in fjords and coastal regions around\\nNW Scotland, similar patterns in AR are expected elsewhere, i.e. decreasing AR in\\nlower salinity fjord environments (figure 4.10). Although we do not see this\\nrelationship in figure 4.9, the lack of sample numbers and the lack of information on\\n1 o\\nsample location negate an interpretation of the 8 C: AR relationship from these data.\\n149\\nChapter 4 Marine reservoir ages in Scottish coastal waters\\n100\\n50\\ncc\\n<\\n-50\\n-100\\n-150\\ny =-44.117x+58.772\\nR 2= 0.256\\n0.5 1.5\\n8180,<\\n2.5\\nFigure 4.8 Biplot and linear regression equation showing the relationship between AR and 81sO\\nfrom NW Scottish coastal and fjordic shell samples from this study.

Shells lying within lower salinity water (e.g. shells A and B) should exhibit more negative AR and\\ndepleted 813C and 8180 than those shells lying in deeper, more saline basin waters (shell C).\\n151\\nChapter 4 Marine reservoir ages in Scottish coastal waters\\n4.6 Conclusions\\nThe igneous bedrock geology of NW Scotland, along with the thin and poorly\\ndeveloped soils overlying the steep slopes rapidly translating rainfall into surface\\nrunoff (Black & Cranston, 1995), means that the freshwater inputs into sea lochs\\ntypically should have an isotopic signal close to atmospheric 14C/12C (Broecker &\\nWalton, 1959), i.e. be relatively unaffected by 14C deficient carbon derived from\\nhumus. Unfortunately, information on water depth, temperature and salinity was not\\navailable for the museum shell samples, thus it is impossible to determine whether the\\nshells were collected from depths below the typical stratification for the sea loch in\\nquestion. Despite this, a shell collected from a shallow depth in a sea loch with a\\nthick brackish surface layer or large mixing depth (the depth to which freshwater is\\nmixed down the water column; see Edwards & Sharpies, 1986) is likely to exhibit\\nisotopically lighter 5lsO and S13C (Austin & Inall, 2002; Polyak et al., 2003), and thus\\na \\'younger\\' marine radiocarbon reservoir age (more negative AR value) than a shell\\nobtained from a high salinity water mass (figure 4.10). The shallow mixing depth of\\nLoch Sunart (2 m) and low basin salinity reduction (0.2) means that marine carbonate\\nmaterial from the GC023 core site (120 m water depth) are unlikely to exhibit the\\nlarge AR values measured in the Loch Creran sample (mixing depth of 19 m; 0.4 basin\\nsalinity reduction). Nevertheless, the sea lochs and coastal waters of NW Scotland do\\nappear to have negative AR and a correction factor of AR = -27 ±11 years should be\\napplied to marine radiocarbon dates from the NW coast of Scotland. The use of this\\ncorrection factor to marine radiocarbon dates from the deep basins of Loch Sunart is\\nsupported by the use of the Bondevik et al., (1999) AR value of -20 in sedimentary\\narchives from Norwegian fjords (Mikalsen et al., 2001).\\nTo conclude, the data presented in this study suggests that\\n1. Stable carbon and oxygen isotopic compositions from marine organisms\\nliving in the coastal and sea loch (fjord) environments of NW Scotland\\nlikely reflect the influence of freshwater input and mixing process with\\ncoastal waters within fjords.\\n2. A regional AR value of -27 ±11 years has been determined for the coastal\\nwaters and fjordic waters of NW Scotland, which is statistically different\\n152\\nChapter 4 Marine reservoir ages in Scottish coastal waters\\n(at a confidence level of 99.5%) to the AR value of 14 ± 13 years reported\\nfor UK coastal waters (Harkness, 1983) and in good agreement with the\\n-33 ± 93 years reported by Reimer et al., (2002).\\n3. This negative AR value of -27 ±11 years supports the hypothesis that high\\nfreshwater inputs into NW Scottish coastal waters should produce marine\\nradiocarbon reservoir ages, R(t), \\'younger\\' than the global surface ocean\\nradiocarbon reservoir age of R(t) = 400 years, AR = 0 (Stuiver &\\nBraziunas, 1993).\\n4.

Before utilising them in palaeoenvironmental\\nreconstructions, it is important to understand how the sediment proxies are influenced\\nby environmental parameters. To do this, it must first be ascertained how modem\\nbenthic foraminifera respond to abiotic parameters such as hydrography (e.g.\\ntemperature, salinity, currents) and sedimentology, as well as to biotic factors such as\\nfood availability and inputs of organic matter. Finally, the processes by which benthic\\nforaminiferal assemblage distributions are translated into and the preserved in the\\nfossil record, need to be understood.\\nWhilst the benthic foraminiferal distribution of the NE Atlantic and NW European\\nshelf seas have been relatively well documented (Murray, 1991a; Conradsen, 1993;\\nCorliss & Vanweering, 1993; Conradsen et al., 1994; Bergsten et al., 1996; Alve &\\nMurray, 1997; Austin & Evans, 2000; Hughes et al., 2000; Gooday & Hughes, 2002;\\nKlitgaard-Kristensen et al., 2002; Murray, 2003b; Scott et al., 2003), literature on the\\nbenthic foraminifera in NW European fjords is fairly limited. The majority of these\\nstudies focus on Scandinavian fjords which tend to be either deep with deep sills, or\\nanoxic (e.g. Hoglund, 1947; Thiede et al., 1981; Qvale et al., 1984; Alve & Nagy,\\n1986a, b, 1988; Alve, 1990; Alve & Nagy, 1990; Austin & Sejrup, 1994; Alve, 1995;\\nHusum & Hald, 1998; Klitgaard-Kristensen & Buhl-Mortensen, 1999; Mikalsen et al.,\\n1999; Gustafsson & Nordberg, 2000, 2001; Murray et al., 2003).\\nThere is a general dearth of data on benthic foraminiferal distribution in the seas\\naround NW Scotland. Heron-Allen & Earland (1916) recorded the distribution of\\nforaminifera around the NW Scottish coast, which included two shallow samples (<\\n21 m water depth) from Loch Sunart: one from Laga Bay in the main basin, and\\nanother from the outer basin. Hannan & Rogerson (1997) studied the benthic\\nforaminiferal distribution in the Clyde Sea, although without reference to species.\\n154\\nChapter 5 Modern benthic foraminiferal distribution in Loch Sunart\\nMurray et al., (2003) recently investigated the benthic foraminifera distribution in the\\nhighly stratified fjord, Loch Etive. Though the Clyde Sea behaves like a sea loch in\\nmany respects, it is different enough from a fjord for it to be excluded from the\\ncatalogue of Scottish Sea Lochs (pers. comm., A. Edwards, 2003 and Edwards &\\nSharpies, 1986). The hydrography of Loch Etive is also very different to Loch Sunart,\\nwith a more restricted exchange with \\'open\\' coastal waters along with a higher\\nfreshwater input (Edwards & Sharpies, 1986) and high terrestrial organic matter input,\\nresulting in the benthic foraminiferal assemblages being dominated by agglutinated\\ntaxa. Murray (2003b) also reported on the benthic foraminifera assemblages from\\ndeeps on the Hebridean Shelf, with one station, Muck Deep, being situated to the west\\nof the Ardnamurchan peninsula.\\nThis study aims to document for the first time, the distribution of modern benthic\\nforaminifera from a range of water depths in the significant basins of Loch Sunart: a\\nScottish sea loch with a relatively good connection (and exchange) with \\'open\\' coastal\\nwaters.\\n5.2 Methods\\nThirty-one surface sediment samples were collected from Loch Sunart using a van\\nVeen grab or Craib corer (April 2001 cruise) and prepared for foraminiferal analysis\\n(chapter 2). The positions and water depths of these samples can be seen in table 5.1\\nand figure 5.1.\\nLow numbers of stained specimens in Loch Sunart surface sediments preclude the use\\nof live assemblages in this study and instead, the total assemblage has been used\\nthroughout.\\nc\\nThe use of dead or total assemblages in ecological studies has been heavily criticised\\nby Murray (1991; 2000) who instead advocates the use of the live assemblage data in\\necological interpretations. Since the primary aim of the study is to aid the\\ninterpretation of fossil assemblages in Loch Sunart, it is important to gain a sense of\\nhow benthic foraminiferal assemblages respond to prevailing (long-term) marine\\nconditions rather than to seasonal \\'snapshots\\' (e.g. Conradsen, 1993; also see section\\n155\\nTable5.1PositionsfLochSunarturfaceedim ntampleselect dfor m nif rala alys .L t udi ll ngitudi alpostionspres eddec l e-ordi ates, andthenegativesi nprecedinglongitur fl ctstw sterleypositioni hregardGre nwichm r ian,i. .0°Alshowatre dedbo t mw rt mp ratur (BWT)andbottomwaters linity( Ssedimentologicalinfor ationregardingthmples,.g.or n ctterc e tgr isizprop r t s.Wi rB SWTwa notavailableforsomest tions.

Irrespective of this, the number of live specimens from each assemblage was\\nnoted, as were the number of broken tests (presented in table 5.3). The depth, bottom\\nwater temperature (BWT) and bottom water salinity (BWS) were noted at the time of\\nsample collection, and where possible grain size, % organic matter and % calcium\\ncarbonate analyses were carried out on accompanying sediment samples (see chapter\\n2).\\nData were entered into Microsoft Excel worksheets and formatted for use in the\\ncomputer programmes PAST (Hammer et al., 2001) and Minitab vl4, both of which\\nwere used for statistical analyses. Foraminiferal abundance graphs were plotted using\\nthe computer programme C2 (Juggins, 2003a, b).\\n5.2.1 Diversity indices\\nWhen determining the diversity of samples, numerical methods must be selected\\nwhich are not dependent on sample size. For example, it is likely that a greater\\nnumber of species will be observed in sample counts of say > 400 specimens than ~\\n300 specimens. Therefore diversity indices were determined by calculating the Fisher-\\na species diversity, the heterogeneity (via the Shannon-Weaver index of entropy) and\\nthe dominance (using the Simpson index), details of which are provided in appendix\\n7. Diversities were calculated using the statistical computer package PAST (Hammer\\net al., 2001).\\n5.2.2 Multivariate Statistical Analyses\\nThe benthic foraminiferal assemblages from Foch Sunart were subjected to R-mode\\ncluster analysis (using PAST), in order to determine any similarities between sample\\nassemblages. After transforming the data (by square-rooting; Feps & Smilauer, 2003)\\nto stabilise variances and reduce the \\'signal to noise\\' ratio (Prentice, 1980), the cluster\\nanalysis was carried out using the Bray-Curtis similarity measure (Bray & Curtis,\\n1957) with the unweighted pair group method with arithmetic averaging (UPGMA)\\nalgorithm. The Bray-Curtis similarity measure is commonly used in ecological\\nstudies (Leps & Smilauer, 2003) and utilises abundance data rather than binary data.\\nThe UPGMA algorithm was used in preference to the single linkage or minimum\\n158\\nChapter 5 Modern benthic foraminiferal distribution in Loch Sunart\\nvariance clustering (i.e. Ward\\'s method) algorithms since single linkage methods are\\nreported to perform poorly (Parker & Arnold, 1999) and Hammer et al., (2001)\\nsuggests Ward\\'s method works best with the Euclidean distance, which itself is not\\nthe best similarity measure for community analysis.\\nThe interpretation of hierarchical cluster analysis dendograms must be carried out\\nwith care, since the results of this multivariate statistical method are: i) not subject to\\nsignificance testing and ii) will always produce clusters irrespective of whether or not\\nthe data forms distinct groups (Parker & Arnold, 1999). Additionally, while this\\nmethod clusters \\'similar\\' data together, it gives no ecological information; thus cluster\\nanalysis results must be interpreted qualitatively and may give way to subjectivity.\\nParker & Arnold (1999) suggest additional multivariate analyses should be carried out\\nto verify potential assemblages, and Shi (1993) recommends an integrated\\nmultivariate approach to the statistical analyses of ecological data: combining cluster\\nanalysis to classify the data into groups, and then ordination techniques to quantify\\ninter-relationships. Therefore, non-metric multidimensional scaling (using the Bray-\\nCurtis similarity measure) was applied to the data using PAST (Hammer et al., 2001)\\nas was simultaneous Q-mode and R-mode factor analysis using Minitab vl4 (e.g.\\nWalden & Smith, 1995).\\n5.3 Results\\nA total of 149 benthic foraminiferal taxa were recorded in Loch Sunart, comprising of\\n42 agglutinated taxa, 12 porcelaneous taxa and 95 hyaline taxa. Count data was\\ntransformed into percentage abundances (appendix 8) and the most common taxa (i.e.\\nthose present in over 20% of the samples) occurring in Loch Sunart are represented in\\ntable 5.2. Appendix 9 shows the total recorded taxa and taxa codes used in the study.\\nPlanktonic foraminifera tend to be extremely rare in Loch Sunart, occurring in only 6\\nassemblages. Sample 27 has the highest abundance of planktonic foraminifera (7.6\\n%) which is probably due to it\\'s proximity to the \\'open\\' coastal waters. The\\nremaining samples contain rare planktonic foraminifera (< 0.88 %). Given the rarity\\nof planktonic foraminifera in the Loch Sunart samples, individuals were not identified\\nto species level.\\n159\\nChapter 5 Modern benthic foraminiferal distribution in Loch Sunart\\nTable 5.2 Common benthic foraminiferal species in Loch Sunart sorted by the number of\\noccurrences in samples.

Benthic foraminiferal abundance\\nper gram of dry residue (specimens.g\"1) has also been calculated (appendix 7).\\nThough this method does not account for the particle size distribution of the sample, it\\nhas been calculated for comparison to other studies (e.g. Alve & Nagy, 1986a).\\nBenthic foraminiferal abundance varies greatly in Loch Sunart assemblages, ranging\\nfrom 9 - 1343 specimens.cm\"3for samples 149 to 176 respectively (table 5.3), with low\\nabundances tending to occur in very shallow water depths (e.g. sample 53). For\\nsamples from water depths >16m, the mean abundance is calculated as 406\\nspecimens.cm\"3.\\nFactor analysis of benthic foraminiferal abundance values and environmental\\nvariables measured in Loch Sunart shows the first two factors account for 59 % of the\\nvariance in the data, with summer BWT and grain size parameters such as % silt, %\\nsand and % organic matter plotting against the first factor (figure 5.2). Longitude and\\n% CaC03 are the most important variables on the second factor axis (figure 5.2).\\nCorrelations appertaining to longitude appear negative due to the negative sign\\npreceding the decimalised longitude, however they must be interpreted as being the\\ninverse of this, i.e. positive. Although longitude is a spatial variable rather than a\\nparameter appertaining solely to substrate or hydrography, it is a factor which\\nrepresents a combination of a multitude of environmental parameters, such as BWS\\nand substrate properties, as well as variables which were not measured (e.g. oxygen\\navailability, quality of organic matter, nutrient loadings etc).\\nLinear correlation coefficients (table 5.4) of benthic foraminiferal abundance values\\nand environmental variables measured in Loch Sunart show that no significant\\nrelationships exist between foraminiferal abundance calculated by specimens.cm\"3 and\\nenvironmental variables, and this is also suggested by the short specimens.cm\" line in\\nthe factor analysis (figure 5.2).

These relationships prevail even when\\nonly main basin and outer basin data is used, i.e. the environmental gradient of the\\nBWS is weakened.\\nBenthic foraminiferal abundance calculated by specimens.g\"1 appears to be closely\\nrelated to substrate properties (figure 5.2). The strongest abundance relationship is\\nwith the % organic matter of sediment (r = 0.55, p = 0; table 5.4), though grain size is\\nalso important, with foraminiferal abundances decreasing with increasing mean grain\\nsize, i.e. higher abundances are found in finer grained sediments. The strong\\ncorrelation between % silt and % organic matter in sediments (r = 0.67, p = 0.0) is\\nlikely to explain the results of the factor analysis.\\n5.3.2 Live benthic foraminifera in Loch Sunart surface sediments\\nSample 53 has the highest proportion of live specimens, with 83 % of the assemblage\\ncomprising of live E. willamsoni specimens, however the numbers of \\'live\\' specimens\\nin Loch Sunart benthic foraminiferal assemblages are typically low (table 5.3) with\\nonly 8 samples containing between 5-32 % of live specimens.\\nSince live benthic foraminiferal specimens are rare in Loch Sunart (tables 5.3 and 5.5)\\nand numbers are too low to be statistically significant, little ecological information can\\nbe derived from the data. Linear correlations (see table 5.4) point to significant\\npositive correlations between % live specimens and % organic matter (r =0.63, p = 0)\\nand water depth (r =0.41, p = 0.03). A negative correlation exists between % live\\nspecimens and % sand (r=-0.377, p=0.041), and although other grain size attributes\\nsuch as % silt show slightly insignificant (i.e. 0.05 < p < 0.1) correlations (table 5.4),\\nfactor analysis suggests that the % live specimens in a sample is closely correlated\\nwith substrate % organic matter and % of silt (figure 5.2).\\n165\\nChapter 5 Modern benthic foraminiferal distribution in Loch Sunart\\nTable 5.5 Live count data (L) and total count data (T) from Loch Sunart surface sediment samples.\\nThe representation of live specimens as a % of the total assemblage is also given.\\nStation 27 41 45 53 68 72 76 80 90 101 110 112 147 149 173 176 181 189 192 193 197 198 200 202 210 211 Total live Total Deac Representation\\nAdercotryma glomeratum 5\\n9\\n16\\n25\\n4\\n12\\n1\\n8\\n2\\n8\\n1\\n2\\n1\\n2\\n2\\n2\\n3\\n3\\n3\\n15\\n38 86 44.2\\nAmmonia becarrii 6\\n24\\n5\\n57\\n5\\n15\\n2\\n16\\n5\\n20\\n2\\n18\\n1\\n19\\n2\\n83\\n7\\n18\\n1\\n36\\n1\\n74\\n2\\n76\\n4\\n28\\n2\\n12\\n4\\n11\\n1\\n32\\n50 539 9.3\\nAmmoscalaria runiana 2\\n5\\n2\\n19\\n20\\n26\\n1\\n7\\n2\\n34\\n1\\n8\\n1\\n13\\n3\\n6\\n32 118 27.1\\nAmphicoryna scalaris 1\\n2\\n1 2 50.0\\nBolivina pseudoplicata 2\\n6\\n2 6 33.3\\nBolivina pseudopunctata 1\\n13\\n1\\n1\\n2\\n15\\n1\\n3\\n5 32 15.6\\nBolivina spathula 2\\n16\\n1\\n9\\n3 25 12.0\\nBolivina striatula 1\\n2\\n1 2 50.0\\nBolivina variablis 2\\n3\\n2 3 66.7\\nBuliminamarginata 8\\n42\\n5\\n58\\n32\\n118\\n5\\n107\\n3\\n29\\n3\\n16\\n1\\n96\\n1\\n28\\n6\\n18\\n1\\n120\\n44\\n121\\n1\\n3\\n110 756 14.6\\nBuliminella elegantissimsa 1\\n1\\n1 1 100.0\\nCassudulina obtusa 1\\n2\\n1 2 50.0\\nCibicides lobatulus 1\\n23\\n1\\n7\\n3\\n119\\n3\\n5\\n2\\n101\\n10 255 3.9\\nCribrostomoides kosterensis I\\nII\\n1 11 9.1\\nEggerelloiodes scaber 13\\n26\\n5\\n39\\n5\\n19\\n1\\n189\\n15\\n144\\n6\\n75\\n12\\n249\\n80\\n233\\n3\\n20\\n1\\n25\\n3\\n13\\n1\\n47\\n5\\n1.39\\n150 1218 12.3\\nElphidium excavatum 3\\n16\\n2\\n9\\n5 25 20.0\\nElphidium magellanicum 1\\n1\\n1 1 100.0\\nElphidium macellum 2\\n61\\n2 61 3.3\\nElphidiummargarataceum 1\\n5\\n1 5 20.0\\nElphidium williamsoni 133\\n160\\n1\\n4\\n134 164 81.7\\nEpistominella vitrea 1\\n9\\n1\\n3\\n1\\n4\\n3 16 18.8\\nFissurina elliptica 1\\n2 4\\n1\\n1\\n2 7 28.6\\nFissurina lucida 1\\n1\\n1 1 100.0\\nHaplophragmoides sp A 1\\n6\\n3\\n4\\n4 10 40.0\\nHaplophragmoides bradyi 1\\n9\\n1 9 11.1\\nLagena substriata 1\\n1\\n1 1 100.0\\nMelonis barleaanum 1\\n2\\n1 2 50.0\\nMiliolina spp. 3\\n5\\n3 5 60.0\\nNonion auricula 2\\n10\\n1\\n2\\n3 12 25.0\\nNonion depressulus 2\\n8\\n2 8 25.0\\nNonionella turgida 11\\n32\\n2\\n18\\n11\\n54\\n1\\n3\\n2\\n5\\n5\\n19\\n4\\n5\\n2\\n2\\n1\\n1\\n2\\n14\\n6 7\\n9\\n17\\n29\\n10\\n13\\n3\\n20\\n26\\n39\\n1\\n1\\n3\\n3\\n114 267 42.7\\nParafissurina himatiostoma 1\\n1\\n1 1 100.0\\nPsammosphaera bowmanni 1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n5 5 100.0\\nQuinqueloculina seminlum 1\\n9\\n2\\n9\\n3 18 16.7\\nRecurvoides trochamminforme 4\\n5\\n5\\n7\\n2\\n2\\n5\\n7\\n2\\n11\\n18 32 56.3\\nRhabdammina sp. 1\\n2\\n1\\n1\\n2 3 66.7\\nRheophax scotti 1\\n1\\n6\\n6\\n7 7 100.0\\nRheophax subfusiformis 2\\n2\\n1\\n3\\n2\\n8\\n1\\n4\\n1\\n6\\n1\\n5\\n1\\n4\\n9 32 28.1\\nRosalina praegeri 2\\n3\\nI\\nII\\n6\\n13\\n9 27 33.3\\nSpiroplectammina earlandi 1\\n2\\n1\\n3\\n1\\n9\\n3 14 21.4\\nSpiroplectammina wrightii 1\\n4\\n1\\n74\\n4\\n18\\n3\\n87\\n8\\n88\\n17 271 6.3\\nStainforthia fusiformis 1\\n42\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n6\\n2\\n7\\n1\\n3\\n1\\n1\\n4\\n8\\n1\\n1\\n10\\n30\\n23 100 23.0\\nStainforthia loeblichi 1\\n4\\n1\\n3\\n1\\n2\\n3 9 33.3\\nTextularia earlandi 1\\n2\\n1 2 50.0\\nTrifarina angulosa 2\\n3\\n2 3 66.7\\nTrochammina cf. parvus 1\\n1\\n1 1 100.0\\nVernueilla advena 1\\n1\\n1 1 100.0\\nTrochammina adaptera 1\\n1\\n1 1 100.0\\n166\\nChapter 5 Modern benthic foraminiferal distribution in Loch Sunart\\n5.3.3 Spatial distribution of benthic foraminifera\\n5.3.3.1 Wall structure\\nThe ternary plot in figure 5.3a shows the characteristic wall structures of the Loch\\nSunart benthic foraminiferal assemblages (% data in table appendix 8). Porcelaneous\\ntaxa have fairly low proportions (<10 %) in all assemblages, particularly in the inner\\nbasin (<3.5%), though the proportion of porcelaneous taxa increases towards the outer\\nbasin (figure 5.3b).\\nInner basin samples are typically dominated by agglutinated species, with proportions\\noften exceeding 80 %. Though shallow sample 53 lies within the inner basin, it yields\\nonly hyaline species. The two inner basin samples with lower proportions of\\nagglutinated species (110 and 112) are situated close to the sill region, and it is likely\\nthat these sample locations experience relatively saline main basin water. Sample\\nsites located further away from the sill are likely to experience brackish water for the\\nmajority of the year.\\nMain and outer basin assemblages are dominated by relatively high proportions of\\nhyaline taxa, low agglutinated species and low porcelaneous percentage abundances\\n(figure 5.3), with mean ratios of 72: 27: 1 and 77: 20: 3 respectively. A 2-sample T\\ntest (Davis, 2002) suggests there is little difference in the proportions of wall types of\\nthe main and outer basin (T-value =-1.72 , p = 0.101), though figure 5.3b clearly\\nshows a higher proportion of porcelaneous taxa in the outer basin.\\n5.3.3.2 Species diversity\\nLoch Sunart benthic foraminiferal assemblages yield a broad range of diversity values\\nranging from 0.7 - 22.6 for the Fisher-a index, 0.1 - 3.6 for the Shannon-Weaver\\nindex and 0.04 - 0.96 for the Simpson index (table 5.3). The Shannon-Weaver\\n(commonly referred to as the information function) and Simpson indices are strongly\\ncorrelated (r = 0.92, p = 0; figure 5.4), thus only the Shannon-Weaver index will be\\nused here.\\nSamples with a low species diversity (either Fisher-a or Shannon-Weaver values)\\ngenerally have assemblages with low equitability, that is they have assemblages\\n167\\nChapter 5 Modem benthic foraminiferal distribution in Loch Sunart\\n* Inner basin\\na Main basin\\na Outer basin\\n* Loch Teacuis\\n% Porcellaneous\\n10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90\\n% Hyaline\\nB\\nLongitude, dec W\\nInner basin sill\\nMain basin sill\\nMain basin\\n50 £\\n\"O\\np-\\n3\\nIUU\\n10 15 20\\nDistance from loch mouth, km\\nFigure 5.3 A) Ternary plot showing wall structures of benthic foraminiferal assemblages in Loch Sunart,\\nalong with Murray\\'s (1973) classification of marine environments.

The Fisher-\\nalpha index represents the species diversity within a sample of n individuals and takes rarer species\\ninto account. The Simpson index reflects the dominance of taxa within the sample, with assemblages\\ndominated by a few taxa having lower Simpson indices. Assemblages with low species diversity are\\noften dominated by a few taxa (A). The Shannon-Weaver index (often referred to as the information\\nfunction) represents both species diversity and how the abundances are spread over the species\\n(e.g.equitability). Assemblages with a high species diversity tend to have high equitability, i.e. the\\nabundance is spread evenly over the species present, as shown by plots B and C.\\n169\\nChapter 5 Modern benthic foraminiferal distribution in Loch Sunart\\ndominated by a few species (figure 5.4). Conversely, samples with high species\\ndiversity have higher equitability values and species abundance is more evenly spread\\nover the taxa. Two trendlines can be extracted from the data shown in figure 5.4a and\\n5.4b, with the inner basin samples having a steeper trend than the main and outer\\nbasin trendline. The differences in slope are likely to be salinity differences between\\nthe basins with the inner basin waters typically being more hyposaline than the outer\\nand main basin waters.\\nInner basin assemblages tend to have the lowest species diversity, and samples appear\\nto be clustered into two groups (with the exception of anomalous sample 53); those\\nwith Fisher-a indices of around 6 and Shannon-Weaver values of -1.2 and those with\\nricher species diversity and equitability (Fisher-a values - 9 and Shannon-Weaver\\nvalues -2; figure 5.4b). Two of the three low diversity inner basin samples (68 and\\n147) represent the shallowest samples from the inner basin and are dominated by a\\nfew taxa, in this case Eggerelloides scaber. Haynes, (1981) suggested that samples\\nwith low equitability tend to occur in stressed environments, and the lower salinities\\n(30.7-31.3) in the inner basin shallower water depths are likely to lead to only tolerant\\nspecies being able to inhabit the environment. Though sample 149 is from deeper\\nwater with a higher BWS, the high content of substrate organic matter (18 %) may\\npresent a stressed environment for some foraminiferal species. The sample with the\\nlowest species diversity (Fisher-a = 0.7) and lowest equitability (0.08) is sample 53,\\nwhich is dominated by a single taxon, Elphidium williamsoni, with an abundance of\\n-98%. This sample location has a water depth of only 4.5 m, and given the tidal range\\nin Loch Sunart (- 4 m), represents the most extreme physical environment of all the\\nassemblages. The dominance of an assemblage by a single taxon is common in\\nstressed environments (Murray, 1973), thus the sample was included in the cluster\\nanalysis due to it being a \\'true\\' outlier, i.e. not a product of sampling or analysis\\nfailure (Shi, 1993). However, it has been excluded from most of the statistical\\nanalyses, since the data from this extreme environment significantly skewed the\\nresults.\\nMain basin assemblages show a large range in species diversity and equitability\\n(figure 5.4), probably due to the wide variability of sample environments within the\\ndata set, e.g. different water depths, different substrates etc. Diversity indices tend to\\n170\\nChapter 5 Modem benthic foraminiferal distribution in Loch Sunart\\nbe strongly positively correlated with BWS (table 5.4) with species diversity and\\nequitability increasing towards the coast (e.g. figure 5.5). Weak positive correlations\\nbetween the diversity indices and depth are also apparent (table 5.4), probably due to\\nthe inter-correlations between depth, BWT and BWS, % silt and % organic matter in\\nthe sediments (table 5.4). Also apparent is a positive and fairly strong correlation\\nbetween diversity and % CaC03 present in the sediments, which in turn, is correlated\\nwith BWS. This suggests that outer basin samples, which are situated within \\'normal\\nmarine\\' water masses (i.e. salinities >34) should show richer species diversities,\\nhowever outer basin samples typically yield lower diversity assemblages than main\\nbasin samples (figure 5.5). This may be due to grain size effects, with coarse grained\\nsubstrates found in the shallower and more energetic water column of the outer basin.\\nOne would therefore expect to see the highest diversities in calm, outer basin\\nenvironments and this is seen in sample 27, which has the highest foraminiferal\\nabundance, species diversity and equitability and is located in an isolated deep (113 m\\nwater depth) of the outer basin (average water depth ~ 70 m).\\n5.3.3.3 Longitudinal distribution ofLoch Sunart benthic foraminifera\\nThe distribution of common benthic foraminiferal species (i.e. those with relative\\nabundances > 2 %) show marked variations along the axis of the loch (figure 5.5),\\nwith certain taxa becoming more dominant in specific basins or environmental\\nhabitats.\\nThe majority of common agglutinated taxa, e.g. Ammoscalaria runiana (grouped with\\nAmmoscalaria pseudospiralis), Cribrostomoides species, Spiroplectaminna earlandi\\nand the Rheophax species (comprising primarily of Rheophax subfusifortnis and\\nRheophax scotti) typically have their maximum abundances within the inner basin of\\nLoch Sunart, though they are present throughout most of the assemblages in reduced\\nabundances. Eggerelloides scaber is the dominant taxon in the inner basin,\\ncontributing ~ 22-79 % of each assemblage, and though this species becomes less\\ndominant outside the inner basin, the majority of main and outer basin assemblages\\ncontain between 1-11% E. scaber (table 5.2; figure 5.5).

The rest of the agglutinated taxa (Adercotryma glomeratum,\\nHaplophragmoides bradyi, Recurvoides trochamminiforme) have their maximum\\nabundances within the main basin, which may be due to the relatively calm\\ndepositional environment, as interpreted by the fine grained sediments.\\nSpiroplectammina wrightii (grouped here with Textularia bocki) is rare or absent in\\ninner basin assemblages, prevalent in the main basin and shows maximum abundances\\nin the seaward part of the main basin and within the outer basin (figure 5.5).\\nSignificant abundances of hyaline species typically occur in the main and outer basins\\n(figures 5.3 and 5.5) and may be rarer in inner basin waters due to lowered salinity\\nand increased organic carbon contents (Boltovskoy & Wright, 1976). Maximum\\nabundances of Bulimina marginata, Nonionella turgida, Stainforthia fusiformis, and\\nthe Bolivina spp. typically occur in the deeps of the main basin where environmental\\nconditions are likely to be calm. Fissurina species and Epistominella species are also\\npresent in the main basin assemblages, occurring where low abundances of epiphytic\\ntaxa (such as Cibicides lobatulus) suggest a very calm depositional environment.\\nRarer taxa (< 2%) present in the main basin include Haplophragmoides species A\\n(Haynes), Elphdium magellanicum, Stainforthia species (predominantly Stainforthia.\\nloeblichi), and Trifarina species (mainly Trifarina angulosa). Samples from\\nshallower water depths contain taxa indicative of higher energy environments (e.g.\\nElphidium excavatum, Asterigerinata mamilla, S. wrightii and C. lobatulus).\\nTypical outer basin assemblages (e.g. samples 189 and 192) tend to have high\\nabundances of C. lobatulus, Ammonia beccarii, E. excavatum and S. wrightii which\\nreflect the relatively high energy depositional environments at these sites despite the\\nfairly deep water depths (>75 m). The significant increase in the abundance of\\nMiliolina species is likely due to the influence of more saline water masses (see\\nsection 5.4.1).\\n5.3.4 Depth distribution of benthic foraminifera\\nDetermining the depth preference of benthic foraminifera species proves difficult for\\nLoch Sunart samples (figure 5.6) since the elongated and narrow bathymetry of the\\nsea loch, along with a large spring tidal range (~4m) results in high energy\\n173\\n,5\\n/\\nvV<8^\\n<PeA®#^ *° *\\n3\"\\n//f\\nJ*d^\\n.*yyy\\n*\\ni.J*\\n«r\\n.</\\n«rx\\\\°/\\nJP> i§£^e<.ehxc\\n,■//////SS\\nyyyyy.-,\\nyJ>- ■#.y*\\n■<P\\\\0/J\\n//>///*/*\\n&////sYs//s*^vV+° .i»vrs«y\\nI\\n020\\nFigure5.6aThedistrib tionofbenthicforaminif ra(abundanc s>2%)frL chS nartsurf ceedi e tample p10,plot dag swp .Bottom watertemperature(BWT)andbottoms linitySrec rd dhitlsohown,enthicfor minife albu da cspecimens. m3s ecime s.g\"1), organicmattercontenta dproportionfs niz dparticl sithsedim nmple.T ltL chSun rtplerr ughlyinvers correlated,thuslocationswithhig%fsandiik lyave%lt.B tShann n-We v rind x(Shan onF )is e -lphadicsh wn.Dr wusi g C2(Juggins,2003).\\n—J\\nFigure5.6bThedistributionofbenthicforaminifera(abundances>2%)msurfa ee i nt(deep rt10)L chS n rt\\'ibas ,plott daga t waterdepth.Bottomt m erature(BWT)andb t rs linitySrec rdedtthilsohown,b n icfor minife alabun an e(specim s.c rr3 andspecimens.g1),organicmatterco t ntproportionfndizarticlesiths dim ntple.T oport onL hSu asedim ts ple areroughlyinversec r elated,thloc tionswithhig%fsandik lyvwlt.BShannon-Weavernd x(Sh n onH)tFisher-alp ac s areshown.Tdominanc ofE. c bericlea lyevide tDrusi gC2(J gg s,2003)\\nChapter 5 Modern benthic foraminiferal distribution in Loch Sunart\\ndepositional environments occurring in deep water (chapter 3), whilst shallower\\nsamples can yield fine-grained sediments. However, a single depth transect across the\\nmain basin exemplifies that some Loch Sunart taxa do show general trends with water\\ndepths (figure 5.7). For example, R. subfusiformis, E. scabra, A. mamilla, and E.\\nwillamsoni abundances all decrease with water depth, whilst Bolivina spp.,\\nEpistominella spp., N. turgida, S. fusiformis and A. beccarii all exhibit a preference\\nfor deeper water.\\n5.3.5 Benthic foraminiferal assemblages\\nCluster analysis and non-metric multidimensional scaling identify 4 main benthic\\nassemblage groups (figure 5.8). These groups are also seen in the results of the R-\\nmode and Q-mode factor analysis (figure 5.9). The Q-mode factor analysis (similar to\\ncluster analysis) identifies groups of samples which plot close together in multivariate\\nspace and thus (in this case) have similar benthic foraminiferal assemblages and\\nenvironmental variables (figure 5.9a). R-mode factor analysis shows the correlation\\nbetween species (and/or environmental variables) with highly correlated variables\\nplotting close in proximity on the loading plot and with the size of the factor loading\\nreflecting the amount of variance of a variable (figure 5.9b; Walden & Smith, 1995).\\nIn this case, we can assume that highly correlated species typically occur together in\\nassemblages (e.g. N. turgida and S. fusifortnis), whilst species which plot opposite\\neach other in the loading plot are not usually present in the same assemblage (e.g. C.\\nlobatulus and R. trochamminiforme).\\nSample 53 has a very low similarity (~ 5 %) with respect to the other assemblages\\n(figure 5.8) due to the high dominance of a single taxon, Elphidium willamsoni\\n(abundance of 98 %; see section 5.3.3.2), thus this anomalous sample is not included\\nin the assemblage groups.\\n5.3.5.1 Group A: E. scaber assemblage\\nThis assemblage group primarily consists of inner basin samples containing high\\nproportions of agglutinated taxa (> 70 %) and typically dominated by E. scaber with\\nabundances of 38-79 % (appendix 8).

Inner basin samples 112 and 110 lie outwith cluster A, and\\nthis is likely due to the low abundance of E. scaber within the assemblages (<21 %).\\nGeographically, the sampling locations (112 and 110) come from a similar depth, are\\nclose to the sill region, and contain a high proportion of hyaline taxa (> 50%) in\\ncomparison to the other inner basins samples (< 19%).\\n5.3.5.2 Group B: Cibicides lobatulus - Asterigerinata mamilla - Ammonia beccarii\\nSamples in this group come from all basins, representing a range of water depths and\\ncontain a high proportion of hyaline taxa (typically > 85 %) with a fairly high\\nproportion of broken tests (36 - 72 %; table 5.3).

It is interesting to note that S. wrightii is the secondmost\\nabundant species (16-26 %) in assemblages from the main basin (samples 173, 101,\\n198, 41 and 197) but typically contributes less (< 11%) to outer basin sample\\nassemblages (table 5.6) with the exception of sample 192 (-20 % S. wrightii).\\nConversely, E. excavatum becomes more important in outer basin samples showing\\nthe second highest abundance (14 -20 %) after A. beccarii (19-31 %) in samples 193,\\n189, 181 and 22.\\nSome samples within this assemblage group also contain significant proportions of B.\\nmarginata (6-18 %), E. scaber (4-8 %) and A. mamilla (4-6 %). Species typically\\nindicative of \\'coastal waters\\' such as Miliolina spp. and Melonis barleeanum, are also\\npresent in the assemblages of this group (table 5.6; appendix 8).\\n5.4 Discussion\\n5.4.1 Environmental information from benthic foraminiferal wall structures\\nMurray (1991b) suggests that benthic foraminiferal wall structures can provide\\nenvironmental information and the ternary plots of Loch Sunart benthic foraminiferal\\nwall structures lie in the overlap of hyposaline lagoon and shelf sea segments (figure\\n5.3), with the inner basin assemblages falling \\'nearer\\' to hyposaline lagoon.\\nRestricted basins are often dominated by agglutinated taxa, e.g. inner basin\\nassemblages from Loch Sunart typically have >81 % agglutinated specimens, and\\nhyaline specimens from the deep inner basin of Loch Sunart tend to have thin and\\netched tests. This is likely due to low pH or low calcium carbonate (CaC03)\\navailability (Boltovskoy & Wright, 1976) and either process creates a stressful\\nenvironment for calcareous taxa, which must spend \\'considerable energy recalcifying\\ntheir tests\\' (Boltovskoy & Wright, 1976). The low abundance of porcelaneous species\\nin Loch Sunart assemblages is also typical of fjordic or low salinity environments (e.g.\\nAlve & Nagy, 1990; Austin & Sejrup, 1994; Murray et al., 2003) and Murray (1973)\\nreports that miliolina taxa are unable to maintain pseudopodial reticulum activity in\\nhyposaline waters. Additionally, unlike hyaline taxa which efficiently use available\\nCaC03 during test formation, porcelaneous taxa are thought to have a less organised\\n183\\nChapter 5 Modern benthic foraminiferal distribution in Loch Sunart\\nmethod which requires readily available CaCCL (Boltovskoy & Wright, 1976). This\\nmay explain the lack of this wall type in the inner basin which experiences salinities\\nof < 33, i.e. marine brackish waters.\\nSince miliolina taxa experience life mode problems in restricted basins/hyposaline\\nwaters, the increasing proportions of porcelaneous taxa in the seaward Loch Sunart\\nassemblages may be interpreted as indicators of the increasing influence of higher\\nsalinity (i.e. \\'normal marine\\') water masses (e.g. figure 5.3). This is also true for\\nhyaline taxa which typically become more abundant with increased availability of\\nCaC03 (e.g. Christiansen et al., 1996) and likely explains slightly higher proportions\\nof hyaline taxa in outer basin samples.\\n5.4.2 Loch Sunart benthic foraminiferal abundance with respect to other\\nfjordic environments\\nComparison of benthic foraminiferal abundances from similar fjordic environments\\nproves difficult, since fjords are often unique in their hydrography and depositional\\nenvironments. However, with mean benthic foraminiferal abundances of 409\\nspecimens.cm ~3 and 6,938 specimens.g\"1 for fine-grained sediments (i.e. less than\\n75% sand sized particles), Loch Sunart sediments appear to yield much richer benthic\\nforaminiferal abundances than other fjordic environments with similar substrates. For\\nexample, Hannah & Rogerson, (1997) report abundances of 200-400 specimens.cm \"\\nfor muddy sediments and 20-50 specimens.cm \" for sandy sediments from the Clyde\\nSea, NW Scotland, the equivalent to 340-680 specimens.g\"1 (by applying a factor of\\n1.7 as described in their paper). The lower foraminiferal abundances in the Clyde\\ncould be due to differences in the amount of silt (though no data is given) in the\\nsediments, since the sampling stations are much shallower (< 46m) than the majority\\nof the Loch Sunart stations. Also, it is not clear whether the Clyde Sea foraminiferal\\nabundance is for live or total data. If reported abundance data represent live\\nspecimens only, samples with the highest foraminiferal abundances consists ~ 45 %\\nlive specimens (Hannah & Rogerson, 1997), thus Clyde Sea samples would have a\\ntotal foraminiferal abundance of around 1500 specimens.g\"1. Murray et al., (2003)\\nreported low benthic foraminiferal abundances of 5-65 dead specimens.cm \"3 for the\\nbrackish Loch Etive surface sediments, and this is likely due to the stressed\\n184\\nChapter 5 Modern benthic foraminiferal distribution in Loch Sunart\\nenvironment as suggested by the dominance of the assemblage by agglutinated taxa\\nand the tendency towards dissolution of calcareous test in the organic-rich surface\\nsediments of Loch Etive (pers. comm., WENA, 2005).\\nThe Sandebukta branch of the Oslo fjord shows lower (total) foraminiferal\\nabundances than Loch Sunart, with abundances of 200-800 specimens.g\"1 for\\nsediments from water depths of ~ 10-50 m (Alve & Nagy, 1986a). Austin & Sejrup,\\n(1994) report total abundances of 2.5-52 specimens.cm\"3 in the Syslakvag tributary of\\n•2\\nthe Spjeldnesosen basin (Lurefjord) and 0.3-258 specimens.cm\" from the Fensfjord,\\nnear Havarden. Though the stations from this study were fairly shallow with respect\\nto Loch Sunart (< 40 m water depth), the sediment properties appear similar. Benthic\\nforaminiferal abundances (unstained) to the equivalent of 76 specimens.cm\"3 (3800\\nspecimens/50 cc) are found in the inner basin of the Fensfjord, increasing to 380\\nspecimens.cm\" for the outer fjord area (Klitgaard-Kristensen & Buhl-Mortensen,\\n1999). Calcareous benthic foraminiferal abundances (total) from the Sognefjord (NW\\nNorway) appear to be fairly similar to calcareous abundances.cm\"3 determined for\\nLoch Sunart, with abundances ranging from 4.9-1512 calcareous specimens.cm\"3, with\\n-50 % of samples yielding abundances >100 calcareous specimens.cm\" (Mikalsen et\\nal., 1999). The slightly higher abundances from these deep samples (water depths >\\n121m) may be explained by the finer grained sediments (90% finer than 63 pm) and\\nhigh salinity water masses (~ 35) in this environment.\\nLike many other studies (e.g. Alve & Nagy, 1990; Austin & Sejrup, 1994; Hannah &\\nRogerson, 1997; Klitgaard-Kristensen & Buhl-Mortensen, 1999), the abundance of\\nbenthic foraminifera in Loch Sunart surface sediments is influenced by increases in\\nBWS and silt content (figure 5.2). The inner basin assemblages typically have much\\nlower foraminiferal abundances than the outer or main basin assemblages, however\\nthe majority of the maximum foraminiferal abundances (specimens.cm\" ) occur in\\nouter basin samples and likely reflect competition in normal marine conditions (Alve\\n& Nagy, 1990). High benthic foraminiferal abundance also occur in samples where\\nthe substrates have high percentages of silt, e.g. in the deep basins. Sample 181, with\\na high BWS (34.11) and high silt proportion (64%) in the outer has the highest\\nabundance (1327 specimens.cm\" ), whilst the high abundance of sample 27 (35,873\\n185\\nChapter 5 Modern benthic foraminiferal distribution in Loch Sunart\\nspecimens. g_1) is likely due to the strong influence of marine waters and it\\'s location\\nin an isolated deep in the outer basin (e.g. Murray, 2003a).\\nThus, the steady and gradual trend of increasing foraminiferal abundance from the\\ninner fjord to the outer fjord of Fensfjord (Klitgaard-Kristensen & Buhl-Mortensen,\\n1999) is not seen in Loch Sunart. Since % silt and % organic matter are inextricably\\nlinked, it is likely that relationships correlated with silt are also responding to the\\navailability of organic matter in the sediment (Scott et al., 2003). Typically, C/N\\nratios decrease from a terrigeneous influence in the inner fjord to a more marine\\norganic matter influence in the outer fjord area in the Fensjfjord region (Klitgaard-\\nKristensen & Buhl-Mortensen, 1999). Though C/N ratios from bulk sediment\\nsamples are not available in this study, it is plausible that a similar trend exists in Loch\\nSunart, with organic matter in the inner basin generally being of low quality (i.e.\\nrefractory and derived from terrigeneous inputs from the catchment) whilst main and\\nouter basin organic matter is of higher quality and derived primarily from\\nphytodetritus.\\n5.4,3 Loch Sunart species diversity with respect to other fjordic environments\\nSpatial comparisons of benthic foraminiferal abundances and diversities can be\\ninfluenced by patchiness (Murray, 1973), particularly if there has been a recent\\nreproduction event (e.g. samples 53 and 202) and \\'live\\' foraminiferal abundance or\\ndiversity determined for a sample location could be grossly misrepresentative of that\\narea. Additionally, the sampling method can significantly influence benthic\\nforaminiferal abundance or taxa representation since fine sediment and epifaunal\\nspecimens are easily lost when sampling using a van Veen grab. The 4 samples\\nobtained using the Craib corer (which captures the sediment-water interface), samples\\n45, 27, 41 and 22, exhibit relatively high abundances, though this is likely to be due to\\na recent population explosion rather than a sampling artefact (table 5.3). This study\\nuses the total assemblages, likely representative of 1-2 years, thus patchiness should\\nnot significantly influence the results. Also, since it cannot be determined whether\\nforaminiferal specimens were lost during sampling, it will be assumed that\\nforaminiferal taxa and abundances present in sample residues are wholly\\nrepresentative of in-situ sediment at the sampling location.\\n186\\nChapter 5 Modern benthic foraminiferal distribution in Loch Sunart\\nThe low species diversity and high dominance of the Loch Sunart inner basin\\nassemblages (Fisher-a = 6-10, Shannon-Weaver = 1-2.2) is typical of stressed\\nenvironments (Haynes, 1981 and Murray, 1991a), and the tendency towards\\nhyposaline waters in the inner basin means that the majority of calcifying foraminifera\\nwill have difficulty growing or surviving in these waters (e.g. Boltovskoy & Wright,\\n1976; see section 5.4.1). Murray et al., (2003) report similar Fisher-a diversities of\\n1.5-7 and information function values of 1.23 - 1.85 for agglutinate-dominated\\nassemblages from Loch Etive; a sea loch with an environment tending towards\\nhyposalinity, anoxia and high inputs of organic matter.\\nLoch Sunart main and outer basin benthic foraminiferal assemblages typically have a\\nhigher diversity than the majority of other fjordic (total) assemblages, with around\\n80% of the 28 samples having Fisher-a values between 10-22 (Shannon-Weaver\\nindices between 2.1 to 3.6). Austin & Sejrup (1994) report Fisher-a values of 2-11 for\\nNW Norwegian fjords, whilst Sandebukta yields diversities of Fisher-a values of 1-9\\nand information function (or Shannon-Weaver) values ranging from 0.7 - 2.6 (Alve &\\nNagy, 1990). Murray (2003b) reported Fisher-a values of 12.5 - 13.5 for dead\\nassemblages from the Muck Deep (Hebridean Shelf), which is similar to the majority\\nof diversities in Loch Sunart (figure 5.4). Klitgaard-Kristensen & Buhl-Mortensen\\n(1999) report Shannon-Weaver values of 3-4 from the Fensfjord, suggesting greater\\nspecies diversity and equitability than for the Loch Sunart samples, which is probably\\ndue to a greater influence of \\'open\\' marine (high salinity) water and finer-grained\\nsediments in these deep fjordic sites.\\nMarine calcareous forms can become more competitive under increasing normal\\nmarine conditions (Alve & Nagy, 1990). High species diversities in Loch Sunart\\ntypically occur in assemblages with high specimen abundances, thus likely reflecting\\noptimal growing conditions for the benthic foraminifera. However, Klitgaard-\\nKristensen & Buhl-Mortensen (1999) report no change in species diversity along an\\noffshore - inner fjord transect, despite a propensity for higher foraminiferal\\nabundances in more saline waters. Species diversities in Loch Sunart have strong and\\nsignificant positive correlations to BWS (even when inner basin samples are removed,\\ntable 5.4). Inner basin assemblage diversities are typically low, though samples 110\\nand 112 which are located near the sill area are likely to have a \\'marine\\' salinity\\n187\\nChapter 5 Modern benthic foraminiferal distribution in Loch Sunart\\ninfluence. Interestingly, the majority of the outer basin assemblages have similar or\\nlower species diversities than some main basin assemblages. This is likely due to\\nfiner sediments in the main basin which are indicative of calmer and more stable\\ndepositional environments. Fine grained sediments in Loch Sunart also typically have\\nhigh % of organic matter (table 6.2) and substrates with high organic contents also\\ntend to have greater species diversity (Murray, 1991).\\nA rich diversity of benthic foraminifera is likely accompanied by high diversities of\\nother organisms and probably results in a wide selection of food for predators. The\\nrich species diversity of benthic foraminifera in Loch Sunart surface sediments in\\ncomparison to other fjordic environments, and also to local shelf areas, such as the\\ninner Hebridean shelf, exemplifies the importance of protecting Loch Sunart as a\\ndesignated Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI).\\n5.4.4 Planktonic foraminifera\\nPlanktonic foraminifera do not typically inhabit shelf sea regions (Arnold & Parker,\\n1999) thus juvenile tests found in shelf sea sediments have usually been transported\\ninto the environment (Murray, 1991b). This explains the relative absence of\\nplanktonic foraminifera in Loch Sunart sediments and evidence of etching and\\ninfilling of the small, dead specimens suggests these tests have been transported into\\nthe loch. Sample 27 has the highest abundance of planktonic foraminifera, probably\\ndue to it\\'s proximity to the open coastal water with the possibility of winter storms\\ntransporting planktonic forms into the loch.\\n5.4.5 Distribution of \\'live\\' benthic foraminifera in Loch Sunart: a possible\\nresponse to food availability?\\nMurray (1991b, 2000) suggested \\'live\\' assemblages should be used to determine\\necological preferences of benthic foraminiferal species. Though the low numbers of\\n\\'live\\' specimens in Loch Sunart surface sediments (table 5.4) negates a statistical\\nanalysis of ecological influences on Loch Sunart benthic foraminiferal population\\ndynamics, samples with relatively high \\'live\\' abundances are typically from water\\ndepths > 60 m with a relatively high organic matter content (> 4%; table 5.4),\\n188\\nChapter 5 Modern benthic foraminiferal distribution in Loch Sunart\\nsuggesting a possible benthic foraminiferal response to food availability (e.g. Gooday\\n& Rathburn, 1999; Gustafsson & Nordberg, 2001; Heinz et al., 2001).\\nFood availability or substrate?\\nHowever, maximum \\'live\\' abundances typically occur in fine-grained sediments\\n(negative correlation with % sand; table 5.4) particulary in the fine-grained sediment\\nof the deep basins of Loch Sunart. This fine sediment, possibly accompanied by\\nlower bottom water dissolved oxygen concentrations (e.g. Gillibrand et al., 1996), is\\nlikely to result in a shallower redox boundary than found in the shallow-water coarse\\nsediments. Thus taxa which normally exhibit a deep infaunal depth habitat (such as N.\\nturgida) may migrate to a shallow infaunal life mode for optimal growth conditions\\n(Alve & Bernhard, 1995) as suggested by the conceptual \\'TROX\\' model (Jorissen et\\nal., 1995). Therefore, more foraminiferal specimens and taxa are likely to be included\\nin a 1-2 cm surface sediment benthic foraminifera scrape (chapter 2) from the fine\\nsediments of deep basins rather the coarser sediments of shallower site; increasing the\\npotential for \\'live\\' specimens to be observed. However, fine-grained substrates\\ntypically have high organic matter contents (Bordovskiy, 1965) and it\\'s difficult to\\nascertain whether the \\'live\\' benthic foraminiferal distribution seen in Loch Sunart is\\nreflecting food availability or substrate grain size (table 5.4); indeed it is likely that\\nthey reflect both.\\nSeasonal response to food availability\\nHigh abundances of \\'live\\' specimens (24.7 % and 12.2 % respectively) from samples\\n45 and 27 collected in April, may reflect the benthic foraminiferal response to the\\nspring phytoplankton bloom (Gooday & Rathburn, 1999). Such a response is\\ncommon in seasonally stratified shelf seas (e.g. Murray, 1983; Murray, 1991b) and\\nlocally, in the Clyde Sea, Hannah & Rogerson, (1997) showed maximum abundances\\nof juvenile tests (suggesting a recent reproduction phase, Murray, 1973) occurred\\naround April. A slight increase in Clyde Sea juvenile tests also occurred during the\\nautumn (October-November) phytoplankton bloom and this is typically when the\\nbenthic foraminifera in NW Norwegian fjords tend to reproduce (pers. comm., Dr. G.\\nMikalsen, 2004). Additionally, Scourse et al., (2004) demonstrated that benthic\\nforaminifera in shelf sea environments typically calcify at different periods throughout\\n189\\nChapter 5 Modern benthic foraminiferal distribution in Loch Sunart\\nthe year. Thus, low abundances of \\'live\\' specimens in Loch Sunart could reflect the\\ntiming of sample collection (June).\\n5.4.6 Validating the use of the total assemblage in Loch Sunart\\nThe tenuous possibility of a \\'seasonal\\' benthic foraminiferal response to food\\navailability in Loch Sunart may validate the use of total assemblages in this seasonally\\nstratified fjord. Since sampling is infrequent and essentially restricted to one month\\n(June), using solely the \\'live\\' benthic foraminifera assemblage will only give a\\nseasonal \\'snapshot\\' of the ecological influences upon particular benthic foraminiferal\\nspecies and may not be representative of long-term marine conditions. Conversely,\\nthe total assemblage (representing 1-2 years sedimentation) is likely to reflect the\\nprevailing conditions in the loch, which is the primary variable of interest in\\npalaeoenvironmental reconstructions (due to typically sub-decadal resolution of\\nrecords).\\n•\\n5.4.7 Taphonomic processes - dissolution and transport\\nA problem of using total assemblages is that post-mortem taphonomic processes are\\nnot accounted for, i.e. where a species is found \\'live\\', taphonomic processes occurring\\nafter the death of the individuals may result in dissolution or transport of that\\nindividual away from the site. Murray & Alve, (1999b) regard taxa which are found\\ndead but not \\'live\\' in the Skagerrak-Kattegat, as \\'exotic\\' and allochthonous to the site,\\nhowever they stress that comparative studies of \\'live\\' and dead assemblages must be\\ncarried out frequently over period of at least 1 year before conclusions regarding the\\ntaphonomic processes influencing benthic foraminiferal assemblages can be made.\\nGiven the \\'snapshot\\' sampling of Loch Sunart surface sediments and the known\\nseasonal variability of \\'live\\' benthic foraminifera occurrences (e.g. Scourse et al,\\n2004), marking species out as allochthonous may be misrepresentative of the \\'real\\'\\ndistribution of benthic foraminifera.\\nHowever, many of the assemblages do show signs of taphonomic processes. There is\\nevidence of reworking in the Loch Sunart surface sediments, for example sample 189\\nshows a high percentage of broken or etched tests (53 %) along with 3 broken\\n190\\nChapter 5 Modern benthic foraminiferal distribution in Loch Sunart\\nindividuals of Elphidium arctica and Elphidium asklundi which are both arctic\\nspecies, likely reworked from pre-Holocene sediments. A weak insignificant positive\\ncorrelation exists between the % of broken tests in a sample and the % of sand >125\\npm for samples from the main and outer basin (r = 0.280, p = 0.206). Using figure 4\\nin Murray (1984), the proportion of broken tests in these sediments point to a\\nwinnowed lag deposit which is typical of areas experiencing modest current activity\\non continental shelves or channels in lagoons or estuaries, and the general lack of\\nsmall benthic foraminifera observed in these assemblages (e.g. sample 193) supports\\nthis hypothesis.\\nCalcareous taxa in the inner basin of Loch Sunart are likely to live in a stressful\\nenvironment due to the high organic matter contents of sediments and low salinities\\n(Boltovskoy & Wright, 1976), and this is exemplified by the low proportion of hyaline\\nspecimens in the \\'typical\\' inner basin assemblages (figure 5.3). Where calcareous\\ntaxa are found, live specimens often make up > 50 % of a hyaline species\\' total\\nabundance (table 5.5), pointing to a propensity for the post-mortem dissolution of\\ncalcareous tests.\\nThe pH of marine waters is usually ~ 8, however high amounts of decomposing\\norganic material can significantly lower the pH of restricted basins. The dissolution of\\ncalcareous tests usually occurs at pH values of < 7.8 (Boltovskoy & Wright, 1976).\\nMurray (1968 cf. Boltovskoy & Wright, 1976) reported that hyaline tests tend to\\nbecome opaque fairly rapidly at pH values of ~7 and specimens of A. beccarii found\\nin Loch Sunart\\'s inner basin usually have opaque white tests suggesting clear signs of\\netching and dissolution or low availability of calcium carbonate (review in Murray &\\nAlve, 1999a).\\nHyaline species which host symbiotic algae (or sequester chloroplasts), such as A.\\nbeccarii and N. turgida, are thought to be able to tolerate more stressful environments,\\nand counteract the effects of low pH (Alve & Nagy, 1990) and this may explain the\\nability of these species to live in such stressful conditions. Despite this, calcareous\\ntaxa living in the inner basin of Loch Sunart appear to experience a stressful\\nenvironment, likely spending energy recalcifying their tests, which upon death\\nprobably undergo dissolution.\\n191\\nChapter 5 Modern benthic foraminiferal distribution in Loch Sunart\\n5.4.8 Distribution of benthic foraminifera in Loch Sunart\\nLoch Sunart differs from the fjords of Scandinavia in that both the sills and basins are\\ngenerally much shallower, creating grain size distributions governed by current\\nactivity rather than depth (e.g. figure 2.5). For example, sediment from sample 192,\\nobtained from a water depth of 90 m, contains 64 % sand, whilst sample 181 from 36\\nm, contains only 29 % sand. Additionally, basin water exchange is typically more\\nrestricted in Scottish fjords, and less likely to be influenced by \\'open\\' coastal waters,\\nthus salinities may be lower.\\nMultivariate statistical analyses identified 4 major benthic foraminiferal assemblages\\nfor Loch Sunart. Prior to the discussion of the environmental significance of these\\nassemblages, it is important to understand each taxon of significant abundance or\\ninterest and this will be discussed using the following criteria: distribution of benthic\\nforaminiferal species (abundances > 2%) plotted against longitude in order to identify\\npossible distributions influenced by BWS and quality of organic matter (figure 5.5);\\nspecies abundances > 2 % with depth, with the inner basin and main/outer basin\\ntreated separately (figure 5.6); a single depth transect taken across the main basin to\\neliminate the influence of the spatial variations on environmental parameters (figure\\n5.7); and the correlation of environmental parameters and grouped taxa using factor\\nanalysis (figure 5.9).\\n5.4.8.1 Taxonomic notes on benthic foraminiferal species common in Loch Sunart\\nLife modes for the following benthic foraminiferal species have largely been taken\\nfrom Murray (1991), and have been found living in Loch Sunart, unless stated\\notherwise.\\nPORCELANEOUS TAXA\\nAbundance of porcelaneous taxa in Loch Sunart is typically low (section 5.4.1).\\nHowever, the positive relationship between BWS (figure 5.5 and 5.9) and the\\nabundance of porcelaneous taxa suggests increasing proportions of this wall type may\\nbe used an as indicator for the increasing influence of higher salinity coastal waters\\n(e.g. Christiansen et al., 1996). Quinqueloculina seminulum is the most common\\nand abundant species (< 3.3 %): other common species include Milionella\\n192\\nChapter 5 Modern benthic foraminiferal distribution in Loch Sunart\\nsubrotunda, Spiroloculina rotunda, Quinqueloculina stalkeri, Quinqueloculina\\nbicornis and Triloculina trihedra.\\nAgglutinated taxa\\nA. glomeratum is an epifaunal species which appears throughout Loch Sunart with\\nabundances of less than 5.5%. Thiede et al., (1981) suggested the distribution of this\\ntaxon is restricted by salinity, i.e. it is stenohaline, which may explain the low\\nabundances (< 0.6 %) in the inner basin assemblages. Factor analysis suggests that\\nthis taxon is strongly correlated to the % of silt and organic matter in the substrate\\n(figure 5.9) which agrees well with the findings of Alve & Nagy (1986a). As with the\\nCeltic Sea assemblages (Scott et al., 2003), A. glomeratum is negatively correlated\\nwith BWT and this species appears to have a preference for low temperatures\\n(Murray, 1991).\\nIn this study, Ammoscalaria runiana has been grouped with A. pseudospiralis since\\nbroken specimens have resulted in difficulties identifying between the two. A. runiana\\nappears throughout the Loch Sunart samples, with maximum abundances (>10 %)\\noccurring in the inner basin. Factor analysis shows this species is inversely correlated\\nto BWS and commonly occurs with E. scabra and R. subfusiformis (figure 6.10).\\nThiede et al., (1981) reported occurrences of living specimens in the shallow waters\\n(3-20 m) of the Oslofjord, whilst dead individuals were found down to 200 m,\\nhowever A. runiana has been found \\'live\\' at the deepest parts of Loch Sunart, both\\nwithin and outwith the inner basin. Murray (2003a) found A. pseudospiralis alive at\\ndepths of 218 m in the Muck Deep and suggests this species may be infaunal (Murray,\\n1991).\\nEggerelloides scaher is an infaunal species; known to be tolerant of a wide range of\\nenvironmental variables, and found living in water masses with salinities > 20,\\ntemperatures between 1-20 °C, low oxygen levels, pollutions sources and substrates\\nranging from mud to sandy mud (e.g. Conradsen, 1993 and references within). Hence,\\nit is often found in most fjordic environments (e.g. Hoglund, 1947; Alve & Nagy,\\n1986a; Murray et al., 2003). Few live or dead E. scaber are found on the Hebridean\\nshelf (Murray, 2003b; Murray, 2003a) or the Celtic Sea (Scott et al., 2003). However,\\nhigh abundances of E. scaber are found in Loch Sunart surface sediments, particularly\\n193\\nChapter 5 Modern benthic foraminiferal distribution in Loch Sunart\\nin the inner basin, where E. scaber dominates the assemblages. This is likely due to\\nthe high tolerance of this species, which along with the organic cement of the test,\\nmeans it can live in low salinity/low oxygen environments (e.g. Haynes, 1981).\\nThiede et al., (1981) reported maximum abundances of E. scaber between 10-20 m,\\nwith no specimens observed below 60 m. However, specimens of E. scaber were\\nfound living in all water depths of Loch Sunart (maximum 113 m) and Murray et al.,\\n(2003) found E. scaber living at depths greater than 50 m in Loch Etive. The low\\nabundance of E. scaber in the restricted deep basins of Lurefjorden and Masfjorden is\\nlikely due to the water depth of the samples (> 300 m; Klitgaard-Kristensen & Buhl-\\nMortensen, 1999) rather than location, since Austin & Sejrup (1994) report abundant\\nE. scaber in shallower samples. Scott et al., (2003) report a strong correlation\\nbetween E. scabra and % sand, however only a weak correlation is seen in Loch\\nSunart (figure 5.9) and many other studies report no substrate preference (e.g.\\nConradsen, 1993; Murray, 1991b). Murray (2003a) suggested an affinity between\\norganic carbon content and E. medius (a close relation to E. scaber) and high %\\norganic matter are normally found in fine sediments, whilst E. scaber typically\\nexhibits a positive correlation with organic content in Skagerrak sediments\\n(Conradsen, 1993; Conradsen et al., 1994). In Loch Sunart, E. scaber has the\\nstrongest correlation with longitude, which likely reflects the variation in BWS, as\\nwell as oxygen levels and organic content and quality (figure 5.9).\\nHeron-Allen & Earland (1916) reported Psammosphaera bowmanni occurring in NW\\nScottish sites, and Hoglund (1947) reported occurrences of this species in the shallow\\nwaters (< 40m) of the Gullmar Fjord. Psammosphaera bowmanni was found living in\\nrare abundances (1 individual per sample) in Loch Sunart mainly at depths > 72 m, in\\nsubstrates with sand contents varying between 28-71 %. This species is extremely\\nfragile (Hoglund, 1947) and as with many agglutinated species, the drying and sieving\\nprocess may have broken other P. bowmanni prior to identification. However, given\\nthat most of the specimens found in Loch Sunart are live, and hence represent the total\\nassemblage of P. bowmanni, we may interpret it\\'s presence as an indicator of fairly\\nlow energy environments. This is also true for other fragile taxa such as Rheophax\\nscotti and Textularia earlandi. The fragility of these taxa tests limit their use in\\npalaeostudies due to the likely possibility of destructive post-mortem taphonomic\\nprocesses.\\n194\\nChapter 5 Modern benthic foraminiferal distribution in Loch Sunart\\nRecurvoides trochamminiforme is present in low abundances (<3.2 %) throughout\\nLoch Sunart and the fjords of NW Norway (Austin & Sejrup, 1994; Klitgaard-\\nKristensen & Buhl-Mortensen, 1999), though it is common in Sandebukta,\\nparticularly within the Verneuilina media assemblage which occurs in deep waters\\nunder \\'normal\\' marine conditions (Alve & Nagy, 1986a) and also in the Gullmar fjord\\n(Hoglund, 1947). It has recently been found living on the Hebridean Shelf (Murray,\\n2003b), and Murray & Alve (2000) report common occurrences at water depths >80 m\\nwhere seasonal stratification occurs. In Loch Sunart, maximum abundances of R.\\ntrochamminiforme occur in the deep waters of the main basin and is closely associated\\nwith A. glomeratum and % organic matter (figure 5.9). The negative correlation of R.\\ntrochamminiforme with \\'high energy\\' taxa such as C. lobatulus (figure 5.9) suggests a\\npreference for calm depositional environments. Where live specimens are recorded in\\nLoch Sunart, they typically make up at least 71 % of the total species abundance\\npointing to post-mortem taphonomic processes.\\nMaximum abundances of the infaunal species Rheophax subfusiformis typically\\noccur in Loch Sunart water depths shallower than ~ 60 m (though it is present at 121\\nm), where the % organic matter is low and the substrate is fairly sandy (>60 % sand).\\nHoglund (1947) finds this species in abundance in the Gullmar Fjord, whilst Heron-\\nAllen & Earland (1916) record rare occurrences in their Loch Sunart stations. Though\\nR. subfusiformis is reported to prefer normal salinities and sandy/muddy sand\\nsubstrates in Loch Etive (Murray et al., 2003), R. subfusiformis in Loch Sunart\\ncorrelates with E. scaber and longitude, which is related to BWS (figure 5.9). This\\ncorrelation with longitude may reflect the high tolerance of R. subfusiformis to\\nenvironmental stress and the ability of this species, with it\\'s simple wall structure, to\\nsurvive and grow in hyposaline waters.\\nSpiroplectaminna wrightii is a common epifaunal species on the Hebridean shelf (e.g.\\nHeron-Allen & Earland, 1930; Murray, 2003b; Murray, 2003a) and Heron-Allen &\\nEarland, 1930 reported it as \\'very common\\' at their Loch Sunart stations. In this\\nstudy, S. wrightii has been grouped together with Textularia bocki, based on the\\nadvice of Professor Knudsen (pers. comm., 2001) and Scott et al., (2003) show the\\ndistributions of these two taxa to be very similar in the Celtic Sea. S. wrightii is found\\nthroughout the main and outer basins of Loch Sunart, and is strongly associated with\\n195\\nChapter 5 Modem benthic foraminiferal distribution in Loch Sunart\\n\\'high energy\\' taxa such as C. lobatulus and R. praegeri. This agrees well with other\\nstudies showing this epifaunal/epiphytic taxon has an affinity with coarse grained\\nsediments (e.g. Murray, 1991; Conradsen, 1993; Klitgaard-Kristensen & Buhl-\\nMortensen, 1999; Scott et al., 2003). The low abundances of S. wrightii in inner basin\\nassemblages may be due to low carbonate availability and difficulties in test\\nformation, since this agglutinated species has a calcium carbonate cement (Haynes,\\n1981), and likely explains it\\'s positive correlation with BWS (figure 5.9). The often\\nlow abundance of S. wrightii in other fjords (e.g. Hoglund, 1947; Austin & Sejrup,\\n1994; Klitgaard-Kristensen & Buhl-Mortensen, 1999) may be due to the fine-grained\\nsediments which are typically found in these deep silled fjords.\\nHyaline taxa\\nAsterigerinata mamilla is an epifaunal, inner shelf species, and in Loch Sunart, is\\nfound (dead) to be most abundant at shallow water depths (<30 m) with sandy\\nsubstrates. This substrate preference, along with it\\'s association with C. lobatulus and\\nR. praegeri (figure 5.9) suggests this species thrives in higher energy environments\\n(Murray, 1979). This preference for high energy environments is supported by the\\ncorrelation of dead Celtic Sea A. mamilla with sediments which are skewed towards\\ncoarse sediment and have a high % of gravel (Scott et al., 2003).\\nAmmonia beccarii is an infaunal species with a cosmopolitan distribution and is\\nknown to tolerate a wide range of temperatures (0-30 °C) and salinities (e.g. Murray,\\n1991b), as exemplified by it\\'s abundance in the inner basin assemblages of Loch\\nSunart (e.g. figure 5.5). Difficulties in identifying variants of Ammonia in Loch\\nSunart (e.g. Hayward et al., 2004) lead to all Ammonia specimens being grouped as A.\\nbeccarii (pers. comm., Dr. P. Kristensen, 2001). A. beccarii is common and abundant\\nthroughout the surface sediments of Loch Sunart (table 5.6), particularly those with a\\nhigh % of sand, and it\\'s close association with taxa such as C. lobatulus and A.\\nmamilla (figure 5.9) suggests a propensity towards higher energy environments. This\\nagrees well with other studies which also link A. beccarii with shallow water depths\\n(e.g. Austin & Sejrup, 1994; Scott et al., 2003). An A. beccarii depth trend is not seen\\nin Loch Sunart (figure 5.6), probably due to high current activities often propagating\\nto deep water (section 2.13) , though the preference of A. beccarii for high energy\\nenvironments may explain the rare abundances in the deep (frequently > 350m) NW\\n196\\nChapter 5 Modern benthic foraminiferal distribution in Loch Sunart\\nNorwegian fjords (Mikalsen et al., 1999 and Klitgaard-Kristensen & Buhl-Mortensen,\\n1999). The abundance of A. beccarii closely follows summer BWT (figures 5.5. and\\n5.9) and optimum temperatures for growth and reproduction of A. beccarii fall\\nbetween 15-20 °C (Boltovskoy & Wright, 1976). This may explain the maximum\\nabundances of A. beccarii in the outer basin of Loch Sunart or in shallower areas,\\nwhere temperatures are typically warmer (table 5.3). Murray (2003b) recently\\nextended the northern limit of the warmer water A. beccarii variant Ammonia\\nfalsobeccariv, a variant identified in the Loch Sunart assemblages and which may\\nexplain the higher abundances ofA. beccarii at higher BWT.\\nMaximum abundances of Bolivina species (mainly B. pseudopuntata, B.\\npseudoplicata and B. spatliula) typically occur at deep sites in Loch Sunart, which\\nhave fine grained sediments, fairly high organic matter and high species diversity and\\nequitability (figure 5.9). Though Haynes (1981) suggests Bolivina can tolerate\\noxygen levels as low as 0.1 ml/1, species of Bolivina are commonly associated with\\nwell oxygenated water masses of normal shelf salinity (e.g. Thiede et al., 1981;\\nKlitgaard-Kristensen & Buhl-Mortensen, 1999), and Alve & Nagy (1990) find high\\nabundances of B. skagerrakensis in the deep, stable and high salinity waters of the\\nOslofjord. The Bolivina group occurs with S. fusiformis, B. marginata and N. turgida\\nin Loch Sunart (figure 5.9), and given the affinity of these taxa for stratified waters\\n(e.g. Scott et al., 2003) suggests the presence of these taxa reflect stratified water\\nmasses overlying a calm depositional environment.\\nBulimina marginata is present throughout Loch Sunart (table 5.2) though as with all\\ncalcareous taxa, minimum abundances occur in the inner basin samples. B. marginata\\nis thought to be an infaunal species (Murray, 1991), though Mackensen et al., (2000)\\nsuggests Bulimina spp. may migrate in the sediment to seek optimal growth and\\nsurvival conditions. B. marginata becomes more abundant across the main basin\\ndepth transect (figure 5.7), agreeing with Thiede et al., (1981) who reported high\\nabundances of B. marginata between 20-100 m in the Oslo fjord. B. marginata\\ntypically exhibits a preference for fairly high BWS between 33-35 and BWT around\\n10-14 °C (Thiede et al., 1981) and maximum abundances typically occur in\\nNorwegian fjordic sites with stable, high salinity water masses (Austin & Sejrup,\\n1994) or in the intermediate layer, where the seasonal surface layer and deep stable\\n197\\nChapter 5 Modem benthic foraminiferal distribution in Loch Sunart\\nwater masses meet (Alve & Nagy, 1990). Maximum abundances of B. marginata\\noccur in the main basin in sediments with a low sand content and high organic matter\\n(figure 5.9). A similar association between B. marginata abundance and % organic\\nmatter has been reported for Hebridean shelf sites (Murray, 2003a) and the Skagerrak\\n(Conradsen, 1993) and Klitgaard-Kristensen & Buhl-Mortensen (1999) suggest B.\\nmarginata may thrive in fjordic environments rather than offshore sites due to\\ndifferences in the refractory carbon source, i.e. the ability to use low quality (high C:N\\nratio) food. However, some studies report no correlation between B. marginata and\\ntotal organic carbon (Mikalsen et al., 1999; Klitgaard-Kristensen et al., 2002).\\nMikalsen et al., (1999) found higher abundances of B. marginata in the deeper parts\\nof the fjords and suggested B. marginata thrives under stratified water masses which\\nmay have low oxygen concentrations, and both Klitgaard-Kristensen et al., (2002) and\\nScott et al., (2003) linked high abundances of B. marginata with areas of\\nstratification. The occurrence of B. marginata with other \\'stratification\\' indicators\\nsuch as S. fusiformis and N. turgida suggest this may also be in the case in Loch\\nSunart (figure 5.9). Though Hoglund (1947) reports B. marginata in similar\\nabundances as S. fusiformis in the Gullmar Fjord and though B. marginata is closely\\nassociated with S. fusiformis (figure 5.9), B. marginata is much more abundant than S.\\nfusiformis in Loch Sunart (e.g. figure 5.5).\\nCibicides lobatulus is an epifaunal species with a preference for sandy sediments and\\nhigh energy environments (Murray, 1991). C. reflugens (a close relative to C.\\nlobatulus) is very rare in Sandebukta (Alve & Nagy, 1986a) and low abundances of C.\\nlobatulus in the Sognefjord may be due to the fine grained substrate with dead\\nspecimens suggesting reworking (Mikalsen et al., 1999), whilst Klitgaard-Kristensen\\n& Buhl-Mortensen (1999) attribute the poor-sorting of sediments for the high\\nabundance of C. lobatulus in the Fensfjord/Lurefjord. Though few live specimens\\n(table 5.5) are found in Loch Sunart, abundances are typically high (>20%),\\nparticularly in areas where % sand is high and grain sizes are skewed towards coarser\\nsediments, suggesting an environment with high current activity, for example, at the\\nsill regions (sample 110; figure 5.5) or in shallower waters of the outer basin.\\nConradsen et al., (1994) suggest the patchy distribution of C. lobatulus is a response\\nto localised conditions and substrate, and this is certainly true in Loch Sunart. Scott et\\nal., (2003) suggest C. lobatulus in the Celtic Sea is an indicator of a well mixed water\\n198\\nChapter 5 Modern benthic foraminiferal distribution in Loch Sunart\\ncolumn (i.e. not stratified), which corroborates the ecological preference of the taxa\\nfor fully oxygenated, high energy conditions and accompanying coarse substrates as\\nfound in other studies (e.g. Austin & Sejrup, 1994; Conradsen, 1993; Klitgaard-\\nKristensen et al., 2002). Additionally, Klitgaard-Kristensen et al., (2002) identify a\\nScottish coastal current assemblage characterised by C. lobatulus and Rosalina spp.\\nand dead C. lobatulus are common on the Hebridean shelf (Murray, 2003b), thus the\\nhigh abundances of C. lobatulus in the outer basin samples may reflect transport of C.\\nlobatulus from the shelf and into the loch.\\nElphidium excavatum is an infaunal inner shelf species (Murray, 1971) known to be\\nextremely tolerant to low salinities and a variable environment. It is found in\\nextremely low abundances (dead) in Muck Deep (Murray, 2003b) and the deep waters\\nof west Norwegian fjords (Mikalsen et al., 1999) and found both live and dead in\\nLoch Etive (Murray et al., 2003). In Loch Sunart, E. excavatum is strongly correlated\\nwith depth (figure 5.9), with maximum abundances typically occurring between 30-70\\nm water depth (figure 5.6). Austin & Sejrup (1994) found maximum occurrences of E.\\nexcavatum at 15m depth, whilst Conradsen (1993) reports E. excavatum assemblages\\nare likely to reflect variable halocline conditions in the Skagerrak.\\nElphdium williamsoni is the dominant species at 5 m water depth at the head of Loch\\nSunart. The high proportion of sand at this site (97 %) reflects the extremely high\\nenergy of this environment, which lies close to the inter-tidal range (2-4m) and also\\nwithin the brackish surface layer where BWS can be < 30. Alve & Nagy (1990) also\\nshow E. willamsoni to be most frequent at depths of 1-5 m, and suggest that the\\nsymbiotic algae frequently hosted by species of Elphidium likely supply oxygen to the\\nforaminifera and counteracts the low pH found in these hyposaline waters. Loch\\nSunart E. williamsoni showed a propensity for green colouration, suggesting\\nsymbiosis with algae.\\nThe epifaunal Hyalinea baltliica are found dead in low abundances (<2.6 %) in Loch\\nSunart; particularly in the deep basins which have fine-grained, organic-rich\\nsediments and a propensity for high species diversity and equitability (figure 5.9).\\nHigh abundances of EL. balthica are common in NW Norwegian fjords and have been\\nlinked to a preference for low dissolved oxygen levels (Mikalsen et al., 1999) or high\\n199\\nChapter 5 Modern benthic foraminiferal distribution in Loch Sunart\\nlevels of the low quality (i.e. refractory) organic carbon usually found in fjordic\\nsediments (Klitgaard-Kristensen & Buhl-Mortensen, 1999). Loch Sunart H. balthica\\nalso shows a negative correlation with BWT; a trend also seen in the Celtic Sea where\\nit is attributed to stratification processes (Scott et al., 2003).\\nNonionella turgida is typically a deep infaunal taxon which occurs live and dead in\\nmost Loch Sunart samples and Heron-Allen & Earland, (1916) found N. turgida to be\\ncommon at both of their Loch Sunart stations. N. turgida were found living in the\\nSognefjord (Mikalsen et al., 1999), however it is usually absent or rare in Norwegian\\nfjords (e.g. Austin & Sejrup, 1994; Klitgaard-Kristensen & Buhl-Mortensen, 1999)\\nand instead N. labradoricum (a close relation with an Arctic affinity) is the more\\ncommon species, preferring cool (< 7°C) stable water masses with high BWS (e.g.\\nAlve & Nagy, 1986a). The affinity of this species for fine-grained, organic rich\\nsediments has been recorded in the Celtic Sea (Scott et al., 2003), the Kattegat-\\nSkagerrak (Conradsen, 1993; Conradsen et al., 1994) and the Hebridean shelf\\n(Murray, 2003b; Murray, 2003a) and maximum abundances of N. turgida typically\\noccur in the deep waters of the Loch Sunart main basin (figures 5.5) which typically\\nhave fine grained, organic rich sediments (figure 5.9). N. turgida in Loch Sunart\\nappears in assemblages containing B. marginata, S. fusiformis and Epistominella; taxa\\nwith known preferences for higher salinity, stable deep water masses with a typically\\nhigh organic matter input associated with areas of stratification.\\nRosalina praegeri in Loch Sunart shows a strong association with C. lobatulus, A.\\nbeccarii, A. mamilla and S. wrightii (figure 5.9) suggesting a preference for fairly high\\nenergy environments. R. praegeri is common in relatively low abundances in Loch\\nSunart (table 5.2) and low numbers of live specimens are found in samples from the\\ninner basin sill and outer basin regions (table 5.5), and interestingly, on a scallop shell\\nattached to the inner basin mooring at 40 m water depth, suggesting the propensity for\\njuveniles of this species to be transported up into the water column (e.g. Alve, 1999).\\nAbundances of dead R. praegeri (none are found live) are common at Hebridean shelf\\nsites (Murray, 2003b; Murray, 2003a) and both live and dead R. praegeri are reported\\nin the Celtic Sea (Scott et al., 2003) and in the Skagerrak (Conradsen, 1993). Low\\nabundances of R. praegeri in other fjord environments (e.g. Austin & Sejrup, 1994;\\n200\\nChapter 5 Modern benthic foraminiferal distribution in Loch Sunart\\nKlitgaard-Kristensen & Buhl-Mortensen, 1999) are probably due to the fine-grained\\nsediments.\\nThe infaunal species, Stainforthia fusiformis is known to be an opportunistic species\\nand Alve (2003) provides an excellent review of this species. S. fusiformis is common\\nin fjordic environments (e.g. Hoglund, 1947; Alve & Nagy, 1990; Austin & Sejrup,\\n1994; Klitgaard-Kristensen & Buhl-Mortensen, 1999; Mikalsen et al, 1999;\\nGustafsson & Nordberg, 2000; Nordberg et al., 2000; Gustafsson & Nordberg, 2001;\\nAlve, 2003; Filipsson et al., 2004) as well as some NW European shelf seas (e.g.\\nConradsen et al., 1994; Murray, 2003b; Murray, 2003a; Scott et al., 2003). The rare\\noccurrence of S. fusiformis in Loch Etive (Murray et al., 2003) is likely due to the\\nbrackish nature of the water column, as with the Baltic Sea (Alve, 2003). In Loch\\nSunart, maximum abundances of S. fusiformis occur in the deeps of the main and outer\\nbasins (figures 5.5 and 5.6) indicating a preference for substrates with a high % silt\\nand % organic matter (figure 5.9). This agrees well with other studies which suggest\\nS. fusiformis typically shows a clear response to food availability (e.g. Alve &\\nMurray, 1997; Gustafsson & Nordberg, 2000, 2001), particularly at stratification\\nfronts (Scott et al., 2003). However, many authors suggest S. fusiformis has a\\npreference for sediments with a high proportion of fine sands (e.g. Conradsen, 1993,\\nKlitgaard-Kristensen et al., 2002 and Alve, 2003), and Scott et al.,, 2003 suggested\\nlocations where S. fusiformis is correlated with fine-grained sediments more likely\\nreflects an affinity to the organic matter in the sediments, since fine-grained sediments\\ntend to yield high organic matter contents. In Loch Sunart, S. fusiformis is closely\\nassociated with B. marginata, N. turgida and A. glomeratum (figure 5.9); all taxa\\nassociated with stable conditions and high organic inputs likely to arise from long-\\nperiods of water column stratification.\\nThis study has grouped the Cassidulina species together, though different species\\nhave different ecologies. In Loch Sunart, C. laevigata are typically found in the fairly\\ncoarse sediments of the outer basin, suggesting a preference for high BWS, high\\noxygen levels and a relatively energertic environment, which agrees well with other\\nstudies (e.g. Klitgaard-Kristensen & Buhl-Mortensen, 1999; Mikalsen et al., 1999;\\nKlitgaard-Kristensen et al., 2002; Murray, 2003a). Associations of C. obtusa are\\ncommon in high salinity, probably well oxygenated bottom waters (Murray, 1991;\\n201\\nChapter 5 Modern benthic foraminiferal distribution in Loch Sunart\\nMikalsen et al.„ 1999) and C. obtusa in Loch Sunart is most abundant in the main\\nbasin deeps, and is closely correlated with % silt and Epistominella and Bolivina\\nspecies (figure 5.9). A single live individual of the typically small C. obtusa species\\nwas found in Loch Sunart (sample 173) and low abundances of live C. obtusa is\\ncommon in Sognefjorden (Mikalsen et al., 1999) whilst significant live abundances\\nreported for Hebridean shelf sediments, may be due to the fine mesh used in the study\\n(63 pm; Murray, 2003a).\\nThis brings us to low abundances of dead Cassidulina reniforme in the deep basins of\\nLoch Sunart. Specimens are typically small and it is possible that some individuals\\nhave been misidentified, since C. reniforme classically has an Arctic affinity. Austin\\n& Sejrup (1994) question whether C. reniforme in the fjords of W Norway is due to\\n\\'modern occurrence\\' or re-working of pre-Holocene sediments. The presence of 4\\nindividuals of the Arctic species Elphidium arctica and Elphdium asklundi in sample\\n189, demonstrates that Loch Sunart sediments can be significantly reworked, and\\nsmall C. reniforme could be transported into the main basin, though equally, the\\npresence of dead C. reniforme in the deep, cool bottom water of the main basin could\\nalso be a \\'real\\' occurrence (e.g. Austin & Sejrup, 1994). Additionally, 3 individuals\\nof another Arctic species, Bolivina albatrossi, occur dead and well preserved in\\nsample 90. This good preservation along with the relatively fine grain size of the\\nsediment (table 5.3) suggests a possibility that the B. albatrossi are in situ. Given the\\npaucity of \\'live\\' benthic foraminiferal recordings in Loch Sunart (table 5.5), the fact\\nthat C. reniforme has not been found live in Loch Sunart does not preclude the fact\\nthat they could live there, i.e. absence of evidence is not evidence of absence. Loch\\nSunart\\'s main basin water is strongly stratified in summer (chapter 3) with BWTs\\ntypically around 10-11 °C (chapter 3) in June; probably becoming warmer towards\\nlate autumn (Ellett, 1979) when winter mixing of the water column occurs. Craig\\n(1958) suggests \\'pockets\\' of cold bottom water (< 8 °C) can be isolated in the main\\nbasin of Loch Sunart during the seasonal summer warming, only losing their identity\\nwith winter mixing (a hypothesis also supported by Ellett & Edwards, 1983). This\\nhighlights the variability in inter-annual bottom water temperatures and points to the\\npossibility that Loch Sunart main basin BWT may reach a temperature where arctic\\nbenthic foraminiferal can sustain growth and possibly, reproduction. If this is the case,\\n202\\nChapter 5 Modern benthic foraminiferal distribution in Loch Sunart\\nthen this will be the first recording of C. reniforme in Loch Sunart, and will extend its\\nsouthern distribution.\\n5.4.9 Loch Sunart benthic foraminiferal assemblages: environmental\\ninformation\\nMultivariate statistical analyses on benthic foraminifera identified 4 major\\nassemblages in Loch Sunart (section 5.3.5; figures 5.9 and 5.10).\\n5.4.9.1 E. scaber assemblage: Inner basins\\nE. scaber dominates the inner basin assemblages of Loch Sunart (abundances\\ntypically > 51 %, figure 5.10) where basin water BWS is variable (due to DWREs)\\nand often brackish (< 33), whilst the seasonal change in BWT is large (summer BWT\\nbetween 11.9-12.8 °C; winter BWT ~ 7 °C; chapter 3). Organic matter content in the\\nsubstrate can be variable (7.2 ± 5.5 %), as can the grain size composition of the\\nsediment (1.8 ± 1.1 % clay; 40.6 ± 23 % silt; 57.6 ± 24 % sand).\\nThe domination of the assemblage by a single taxon and subsequent low species\\ndiversity and equitability, along with significant proportions of agglutinated taxa with\\nsimple wall structures such as A. runiana (> 3%) and R. subfusiformis (1-5%), suggest\\na depositional environment experiencing variable and likely environmentally stressed\\nconditions. Hyaline taxa, porcelaneous taxa and aggluintated taxa with a calcareous\\ncement, are present in low abundances, probably due to the low availability of CaC03\\nor the low pH of this hyposaline environment, resulting in post-mortem dissolution\\n(Murray & Alve, 1999c; Murray & Alve, 1999a).\\nBenthic foraminifera species in this assemblage all show high tolerance of fluctuations\\nin their environment (e.g. A. beccarii is the dominant hyaline taxon), which is\\nimportant given the frequent occurrence of deep water renewals in the inner basin\\n(Gillibrand et al., 1995), which greatly alters basin water salinity. Low abundances of\\nC. lobatulus along with the presence of B. marginata, N. turgida and S. fusiformis\\nsuggests a low-energy environment with a propensity for low dissolved oxygen levels\\nand high organic matter of low quality (i.e. refractory).\\n203\\nFigure5.10Distributionofthbenthic foraminiferalassemblagesident ied LochSunartbymultivaria ea alys s; Innerbasin-re trictedexcha ge withcoastalaters (Escaber) Highcurrentactivity (C.lobatulus-Amamillabeccarii) Calmdepositionalenvironment-possiblestratification (6.marginata-N.tur idSfusiformis) Main/outerb sin-mild/epi diccoastalurrentactivity (Abeccarii-C.lobatulusSwright iEexc va um)\\nOuterSill\\nK>\\no\\n4^\\nChapter 5 Modern benthic foraminiferal distribution in Loch Sunart\\nThus, sample locations within Loch Sunart exhibiting an assemblage similar to the E.\\nscaber assemblage are likely to be regions of varying BWS with a propensity towards\\nbrackish salinities (<33) or locations of high \\'low-quality\\' organic matter contents\\nwhich are likely to create a \\'stressful environment\\' for most taxa, particularly hyaline\\ntaxa. Though the applicability of agglutinated dominated assemblages in\\npalaeoenvironmental reconstructions is generally thought to be limited due to\\nproblematic preservation at \\'open\\' marine sites, agglutinated taxa may provide\\nimportant palaeoecological information (Alve & Murray, 1995; Murray & Alve,\\n1999c, 2000), particularly in locations of carbonate dissolution.\\n5.4.9.2 C. lobatulus - A. mantilla- A. beccarii assemblage: High current activity\\nSamples within this assemblage group are characterized by large abundances of \\'high\\nenergy\\' taxa such as C. lobatulus, A. mamilla, E. macellum and A. beccarii and low\\nabundances of taxa with an affinity for calm, stable environments (e.g. N. turgida and\\nS. fusiformis; figure 5.9).\\nSince this assemblage group is observed in all basins, at a range of water depths, it is\\nunlikely that BWT or BWS are major controls on the assemblage. All samples\\n(except 210) have low organic matter content (4.2 ± 3.4 %) which may be due to the\\ntypically coarse grain size of the sediments (% clay< 2.7%; 37.3 ± 30 % silt; 60 ± 30\\n% sand) since organic matter is typically contained in fine sediment.\\n\\\\\\nThis coarse grain size composition, together with high proportions of broken or etched\\ntests, point to a very energetic environment with high current activity. The shallow\\nwater depth (17 m) of samples 184 and 199 explains the \\'high energy\\' assemblage for\\nthese samples. However, samples 110, 112 and 210 are from water depths between 45\\n- 70 m, i.e. well below the depth at which wind or current mixing is likely to influence\\nthe sediments. The geographic location of these samples at sill areas (figure 5.1)\\nsuggest that these assemblages found at water depths deeper than ~ 25 m are likely to\\nreflect very high current activity, possibly due to DWREs. Thus, changes in the\\nabundance of the \\'high energy\\' taxa (such as C. lobatulus) may reflect varying current\\nactivity at a site.\\n205\\nChapter 5 Modern benthic foraminiferal distribution in Loch Sunart\\n5.4.9.3 B. marginata - N.turgida - S. fusiformis: Calm depositional environment\\nThis assemblage group is predominantly located within main and outer basin \\'deeps\\'\\n(> 36 m; figure 5.1) which typically have fine grained substrates (5.1 ± 2.3 % clay;\\n62.5 ± 13.9 % silt and 32.3 ± 16 % sand), rich in organic matter (10.7 ± 2.5 %).\\nTypical summer BWS recorded for these deep basin locations range from 33.5 to 33.8\\nand 34.1 for the outer basin sample, 27. Summer BWTs are typically cooler (-11.8\\n°C) in the main basin than the inner or outer basin (> 12.1°C), probably due to a\\ncombination of water depth and seasonal stratification which likely inhibits the mixing\\ndown of warmer surface waters (chapter 3). High species diversity (Fisher-a = 11.6-\\n22.6; Shannon-Weaver > 2.3) and foraminiferal abundance of assemblages contained\\nin this group likely reflect calm depositional environment and greater competition in\\nthe higher salinity waters (Alve & Nagy, 1990).\\nThis assemblage group is characterised by high proportions of taxa with affinities for\\nhigh, stable BWS and fine grained, organic rich sediment, e.g. B. marginata, N.\\nturgida, S. fusiformis, A. glomeratum, E. scaber and Bolivina species (see section\\n5.4.8.1 and figure 5.9). Low proportions of \\'high energy; taxa such as C. lobatulus (<\\n8 %) along with the presence of \\'delicate\\' agglutinated taxa, such as A. glomeratum\\nand A. runiana point to a relatively calm depositional environment. Similar\\nassociations of benthic foraminiferal taxa are found under stratified settings (section\\n5.8.4.1 and e.g. Mikalsen etal., 1999; Scott etai, 2003).\\nTherefore, Loch Sunart fossil assemblages showing similarities to this assemblage are\\nlikely to reflect calm depositional environments with little current activity. This\\nassemblage is also likely to represent sites underlying a stratified water column,\\nprobably accompanied by a high organic matter flux and stable deep basin bottom\\nwaters which are typically cool and more saline than the intermediate fjordic layer.\\n5.4.9.4 A. beccarii - C. lobatulus - S. wriglitii - E.excavatum: Main/outer basin\\nSamples contributing to this assemblage group are from a range of water depths (23 -\\n121 m) in the main and outer basin of Loch Sunart (figure 5.1). Typical hydrography\\nrecorded at the time of sampling suggests these sites are well ventilated and likely to\\n206\\nChapter 5 Modern benthic foraminiferal distribution in Loch Sunart\\nexperience the influence of coastal waters, e.g. BWT of 11.6 - 12.5 °C and BWS of\\n33.6-34.2.\\nThe presence of taxa such as B. marginata, S. fusiformis and N. turgida (albeit in low\\nabundances) which typically reflect stratified water masses and calm depositional\\nenvironments, alongside significant abundances of taxa with a known affinity for\\nfairly energetic environments (e.g. A. beccarii, C. lobatulus and 5. wrightii-, section\\n5.4.8.1), suggests this assemblage group is indicative of environments experiencing\\nepisodic or mild current activity. This propensity for mild or epidisoic current activity\\nis also reflected in sediment grain size composition, which has fairly equal proportions\\nof silt and sand (50 % sand, 46 % silt and 4 % silt) and a moderate organic content\\n(mean 5.6 ±1.7 %).\\nThe relative importance of S. wrightii and E. excavatum within specific assemblages\\nof this group is likely to be related to basin water or substrate organic content quality.\\nFor example, S. wrightii comprises either the highest abundance or the second highest\\nabundance, in samples from the main basin (173, 101, 198, 41 and 197), whilst taxa\\nwith the highest abundances in the outer basin samples are A. beccarii and E.\\nexcavatum. Thus increases in E. excavatum and A. beccarii at a core site may reflect a\\nstronger marine influence. Additionally, this assemblage group contains taxa which\\nare likely indicative of \\'coastal waters\\' such as Miliolina spp. and Melonis\\nbarleeanum (table 5.6; appendix 8).\\n5.5 Conclusions\\nMultivariate statistical methods (cluster analysis, non-metric multi-dimensional\\nscaling and factor analysis) have been applied to a suite of spatially distributed Loch\\nSunart benthic foraminiferal assemblages. Four benthic foraminiferal assemblages\\nhave been identified, reflecting: A) a restricted and stressed environment (found in the\\ninner basin); B) high current activity; C) a calm depositional environment with\\npossible stratification of the water column; D) main and outer basin reflecting coastal\\nwater influence (figure 5.10). Though the benthic foraminiferal species recorded in\\nLoch Sunart are similar to those found in other Scandinavian fjords, the shallow depth\\nof Loch Sunart, along with the frequent exchange with coastal waters, provides a\\n207\\nChapter 5 Modern benthic foraminiferal distribution in Loch Sunart\\nunique benthic foraminiferal distribution which is very different to other fjordic\\ndistributions. Species diversity and abundance are typically higher in Loch Sunart\\nthan at nearby shelf sites (Murray, 2003b) and many NW European fjord sites, one\\nreason why Loch Sunart has been designated as a Site of Special Scientific Interest.\\nAgglutinated species indicative of low salinity and stressed environments (e.g. E.\\nscaber and R. subfusiformis) were found in abundance in inner basin assemblages, and\\nthe good preservation of these taxa, along with signs of carbonate dissolution, points\\nto the possibility of obtaining palaeoenvironmental information (e.g. basin salinity)\\nfrom these restricted basins (e.g. Alve & Murray, 1995; Murray & Alve, 1999c,\\n2000).\\nC. lobatulus is common throughout Loch Sunart benthic foraminiferal assemblages\\n(table 5.2), however the highest abundances of C. lobatulus occur with other \\'high\\nenergy\\' and robust taxa such as S. wrightii, A. beccarii, A. mamilla, Rosalina spp, and\\nE. macellum at either shallow water depths (>20 m) or areas of intense current\\nactivity, such as the inner basin sill region (Elliott et al., 1992). Thus, an increase in\\nC. lobatulus in core assemblages is likely to reflect an increase in current activity at\\nthe site.\\nB. marginata, N. turgida and S. fusiformis all demonstrated positive relationship with\\nsediment organic matter content, thus typically occur in assemblages where fine\\ngrained sediments point to a calm depositional environment, i.e. deep basins.\\nAdditionally, \\'cool\\' water species such as A. glomeratum, C. reniforme, and\\nEpistominella spp. suggest the overlying water columns of these deep basins are likely\\nto be stratified and the presence of S. fusiformis and Bolivina spp. may reflect lowered\\ndissolved oxygen concentration in the bottom waters of these deep basins. Thus\\nwhere similar assemblages or significant abundances of specific taxa (such as A.\\nglomeratum) are found, conditions may be interpreted as being more stable due to\\nenhanced stratification.\\nThe last assemblage, D, encompasses most of the outer basin and main basin from\\nsamples. The fairly high abundances of C. lobatulus, A. beccarii, S. wrightii, together\\nwith lower abundances of taxa typically found in calm depositional environments (e.g.\\n208\\nChapter 5 Modern benthic foraminiferal distribution in Loch Sunart\\nB. marginata and N. turgida) suggests that locations yielding these assemblages\\nexperience either mild current activity or episodic current activity, as seen during\\nDWREs. The increasing prevalence of E. excavatum towards the outer basin of Loch\\nSunart, points to the possibility that this taxon could be used as an indicator for\\nincreasing salinities in Loch Sunart fossil assemblages. This is also true for\\nporcelaneous taxa which are typically rare in Loch Sunart surface sediments.\\nThe typical fjordic bathymetry of Loch Sunart (i.e. deep basins and shallow sills)\\npresents two potential areas for future palaeoclimatic research. The calm depositional\\nenvironment of the main basin deep presents well preserved, high diversity benthic\\nforaminiferal assemblages. These assemblages are likely to respond to inter-annual\\nchanges in seasonal stratification, organic input and temperature (e.g. Mikalsen et al.,\\n2001; Scourse et al., 2002); changes which may be reflected in test composition\\n(Austin & Inall, 2002; Allison & Austin, 2003) and possible reconstructed using\\nqualitative and quantitative approaches (chapter 7).\\nAlthough taphonomic processes such as the post-mortem dissolution of calcareous\\ntests, are likely to result in problems with generating an isotope record, recent studies\\nfocusing on agglutinated benthic foraminiferal taxa from marginal marine\\nenvironments suggest agglutinated dominated assemblages may provide useful\\npalaeoenvironmental information (Alve & Murray, 1995; Murray & Alve, 2000;\\nMurray et al., 2003). Inner basin benthic foraminiferal assemblages are likely to be\\nhugely influenced by salinity changes and terrestrial organic matter input, thus\\nsedimentary archives from this area may provide useful palaeorecords of\\nenvironmental change in the catchment, such as inter-annual or sub-decadal changes\\nin precipitation (depending on core resolution).\\n209\\nChapter 6 Isotopic compositions in modern benthic foraminifera\\nChapter 6 - Stable Isotopic compositions of modern benthic\\nforaminifera from loch sunart\\n6.1 Introduction\\nThe stable isotopic composition of benthic foraminiferal tests are influenced by\\nenvironmental variables such as temperature, salinity and nutrient availability, often\\nreflecting the properties of the water mass in which they live (see Rohling & Cooke,\\n1999 of a review). Many studies have focused on modern benthic foraminifera to\\nascertain which taxa are the most reliable recorders of water mass properties (e.g.\\nDuplessy et al., 1970; Vinot-Bertouille & Duplessy, 1973; Shackleton, 1974;\\nWoodruff et al., 1980; Belanger et al., 1981; Graham et al., 1981; Vincent et al.,\\n1981; Grossman, 1984b, a, 1987; McCorkle et al., 1990; Wilson-Finelli et al., 1998;\\nMackensen & Bickert, 1999; Mackensen et al., 2000; Tachikawa & Elderfield, 2002;\\nSchmiedl et al., 2004). However, most of these studies focused on deep-sea benthic\\nforaminifera; few studies have investigated shelf-sea benthic foraminifera (Erez, 1978;\\nBauch et al., 2004; Scourse et al., 2004) and no such investigations have been\\nreported from Scottish sea lochs. Before isotopic compositions from benthic\\nforaminiferal species can be used to reconstruct palaeoceanographic conditions, it is\\nimportant to determine whether they are in isotopic equilibrium with the surrounding\\nseawater in which their tests calcified.\\n6.1.1 Environmental influences on test isotopic composition\\n6.1.1.1 Oxygen isotopic compositions\\nStable oxygen isotopic fractionation is heavily temperature dependent and since the\\nseminal publication of Urey (1947) much work has been undertaken to refine and\\nimprove the temperature: 8lsO relationship (e.g. McCrea, 1950; Epstein et al., 1953;\\nCraig, 1965; O\\'Neil et al., 1969; Emrich et al., 1970; Kim & O\\'Neil, 1997; Bemis et\\nal., 1998; Lynch-Stieglitz et al., 1999). Recent palaeotemperature work carried out by\\nBemis et al., (1998) on Planktonic foraminifera yielded the following empirical\\nrelationship:\\nT (°C) = a + b(5C - 8W) (Eq. 6.1)\\n210\\nChapter 6 Isotopic compositions in modern benthic foraminifera\\nWhere: a and b are constants at 16.5 and -4.8 respectively; 5C is the isotopic\\ncomposition of calcite and 5W is the isotopic composition of seawater.\\nA relationship between salinity and oxygen isotopic composition of seawater also\\nexists and atmospheric processes which act upon the isotopic composition of\\ni o\\nprecipitation determine the slope of salinity:8 O mixing lines in coastal waters (e.g.\\nCraig & Gordon, 1965; Israelson & Buchardt, 1991; Mikalsen & Sejrup, 2000). The\\nsalinity:8180 mixing line for Loch Sunart has been established by Austin & Inall,\\n(2002) as:\\n518OseaWater = 0.18 * salinity - 6 (R2 = 0.998) (Eq. 6.2)\\n6.1.1.2 Carbon isotopic compositions\\nMarine phytoplankton preferentially take up lighter 12CC>2 during photosynthesis,\\nresulting in surface waters being relatively enriched in 13C (Rohling & Cooke, 1999).\\nUpon death, phytoplankton accumulate and sink to the sea bed as particulate organic\\n12 c* 13\\nmatter, where it decomposes and releases C, causing lighter 5 C values in bottom\\nwaters. Thus stable carbon isotopic compositions in benthic foraminifera often reflect\\nproductivity, circulation and the ventilation of water masses (e.g. Mackensen &\\nBickert, 1999; Rohling & Cooke, 1999; Mackensen et al., 2000 and references\\nwithin).\\n6.1.2 Equilibrium calcite\\nSince marine organisms tend to calcify in isotopic equilibrium with seawater (e.g.\\n18 18\\nMook, 1968), foraminiferal 8 O should reflect the 8 O of the seawater, hence the\\nsalinity or the temperature of the water mass. Similarly, stable carbon isotopes from\\nforaminiferal tests (813C) should reflect the S13C of the dissolved inorganic carbon\\n(S13CDic) of seawater. However, vital effects (section 6.1.2.1) are common in benthic\\nforaminifera (e.g. Grossman, 1987 and references therein), often resulting in stable\\nisotopic compositions which differ from those expected, i.e. the organism is in\\nisotopic disequilibrium with the surrounding environment. Thus it is important to\\n211\\nChapter 6 Isotopic compositions in modern benthic foraminifera\\ndetermine whether a benthic foraminiferal species is in isotopic equilibrium with the\\nsurrounding seawater before it is used to reconstruct palaeoceanographic conditions.\\n6.1.2.1 Vital effects in benthic foraminifera\\nVital effects in benthic foraminifera were first reported by Duplessy et al., (1970) who\\nnoted that although the isotopic curves of Pyrgo, Planulina wuellerstorfi and mixed\\nspecies from a deep-sea site were parallel, they were offset by l%c or more. Since\\nthen, much focus has been awarded to vital effects in benthic foraminifera (e.g. Vinot-\\nBertouille & Duplessy, 1973; Erez, 1978; Woodruff et al., 1980; Graham et al., 1981;\\nVincent et al., 1981; Grossman, 1984b, a). Grossman, (1987) provides an excellent\\nreview of vital effects in modern benthic foraminifera.\\nThe physiological processes responsible for vital effects fall into two categories. The\\nfirst is kinetic isotopic fractionation, which is thought to be caused by the preferential\\nuptake of the lighter isotopes of carbon and oxygen during the hydration and\\nhydroxylation of CO2 (e.g. McConnaughey, 1989a, b), and is often associated with\\ncalcification rates (e.g. Erez, 1978, McConnaughey, 1989a; Owen et al., 2002).\\nIsotopic variations in foraminiferal carbonate due to ontogenic effects have been\\nreported in some species of planktonic foraminifera (e.g. Rohling & Cooke, 1999 and\\nreferences therein). No such trends have been reported in deep-sea benthic\\nforaminifera (e.g. Vincent et al., 1981; Grossman, 1984b and Tachikawa & Elderfield,\\n2002) until recently by Schmiedl et al., (2004), who reported positive logarithmic\\ncorrelations between the test size of Uvigerina mediterranea from the Mediterranean\\nSea and stable isotopic compositions. Spero et al., (1997) recently showed that\\nforaminiferal S180 and 813C is also influenced by seawater carbonate ion\\nconcentration.\\n1 3\\nThe second is metabolic isotopic fractionation which is demonstrated by 5 C\\n13\\ndeviations from strict kinetic behaviour and results primarily from changing 8 C\\navailable to the organism to incorporate into the shell. Metabolic effects are\\n13influenced by respiration and photosynthetic processes, resulting in the C depletion\\nor enrichment of the organism\\'s internal DIC pool, respectively (McConnaughey,\\n1989a; McConnaughey et al., 1997). Shell 813C tends to reflect the isotopic mixing of\\n212\\nChapter 6 Isotopic compositions in modern benthic foraminifera\\nn 11 n\\nmetabolic 8 C with environmental 8 C (e.g. 8 Cseawater) as demonstrated by the\\nisotopic mixing line seen of McConnaughey et al., (1997).\\n6.1.3 Oxygen isotopic equilibrium\\nThe relationships of temperature and salinity with oxygen isotopic composition\\n(equations 6.1 and 6.2) can be used to calculate the theoretical isotopic composition of\\na carbonate (equilibrium calcite) calcifying at a given temperature and salinity.

Porewater\\n8180 depletion with respect to bottom water 8lsO has been attributed to low porewater\\n213\\nChapter 6 Isotopic compositions in modern benthic foraminifera\\npH and a decrease in carbonate ion concentrations with sediment depth (Bemis et al.,\\n1998), and is thought to influence the negative 813C:S180 correlation observed in\\nbenthic foraminiferal tests (Belanger et al., 1981). Grossman, (1984b) and McCorkle\\net al., (1990) demonstrated that species living in low oxygen sediments (i.e. deep\\ndwelling species) tended to be closer to oxygen isotopic equilibrium than shallow\\ninfaunal taxa.\\n6.1.4 Carbon isotopic equilibrium\\nAgain, since marine organisms calcify in isotopic equilibrium with seawater, stable\\ncarbon isotopes should reflect the 813C of the dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) of\\nseawater (assuming negligible metabolic effects).\\nTemperature exhibits little influence on stable carbon isotopic composition (e.g.\\n1 T\\nGrossman, 1984a; Romanek et al., 1992), whilst salinity influences 8 C of carbonates\\nonly in areas of freshwater and seawater admixing (e.g. Mook, 1971; Spiker, 1980;\\n1\\nLubinski et al., 2001; Bauch et al., 2004). Theoretical 8 CEq.caC03 must therefore be\\ndetermined through direct measurements of S13CDic, i.e.\\nA813C = S,3Cforam-813CD,c (Eg 6.6)\\nMetabolic effects influenced by respiration and photosynthetic processes can result in\\n13C depletion or enrichment of the organism\\'s internal DIC pool respectively\\n(McConnaughey, 1989a; McConnaughey et al., 1997), resulting in \\'vital effects\\'\\n(section 6.1.2.1). Thus test S13C often reflects the isotopic mixing of internal\\nit it\\nmetabolic 8 C with 8 Cdic of seawater.\\n1T\\n6.1.5 Environmental influences on benthic foraminiferal test 8 \\' C\\nKroopnick, (1985) demonstrated that a strong negative linear correlation between S13C\\nof total C02 (813CTco2) and apparent oxygen utilisation (AOU) existed throughout the\\n1 T\\nglobal oceans, with 8 Cdic in the water column closely following nutrient (phosphate)\\navailability. Since the epifaunal taxa Cibicidoides typically calcifies close to isotopic\\n1 o\\nequilibrium with 8 C dic (e-g- Belanger et al., 1981; Graham et al., 1981; Mackensen\\n214\\nChapter 6 Isotopic compositions in modern benthic foraminifera\\net al., 1993), stable carbon isotopes from this benthic foraminiferal group can often\\nyield information on organic carbon accumulation, productivity (e.g. Zahn et al.,\\n1986; Schmiedl et al., 2004) and water mass circulation (e.g. Mackensen & Bickert,\\n1999 and references therein). Unfortunately, no water column or sediment 513C\\nprofiles are available for Loch Sunart or indeed any Scottish fjords at present (H.\\nKennedey, pers.comm 2004), hence the carbon isotopic equilibrium of Loch Sunart\\nbenthic foraminifera cannot be established. Surface waters of the North Atlantic\\n(<500 m at -60 °N) typically have 813C values around - 1-1.5 %c (Kroopnick, 1985;\\nKeir et al., 1998). Whilst the §13Cdic in anoxic fjords tends to be depleted (e.g. -10 %c\\nat 40 m, Velinsky & Fogel, 1999; Gustafsson & Nordberg, 2000), Loch Sunart is well\\nventilated (Gillibrand et al., 1995) hence is likely to show main basin bottom water\\n513Cdic values similar to the 513Cdic of coastal waters (e.g. Hellings et al., 1999).\\n11\\n6.1.5.1 Depth habitat as suggested by S C\\n1 T\\nMicrohabitat effects are the primary influence on the 8 C of infaunal benthic\\nforaminifera with shell SI3C reflecting porewater 813C (e.g. Woodruff et al., 1980;\\nBelanger et al., 1981; Grossman, 1984b; Corliss, 1985a; Sauter et al., 2001). The\\ndecomposition of organic matter (rained down from surface ocean productivity)\\nwithin the sediments consumes oxygen, releasing isotopically light CO2 and thus\\ndepleted 813C into the porewaters (McCorkle et al., 1985). The S13C of sediment\\n1 3\\nporewater is similar to the 8 C:AOU relationship observed in the water column\\n(Kroopnick, 1985), with S13C values becoming isotopically lighter with increasing\\noxygen utilisation. Since infaunal benthic foraminifera species derive C02 for test\\ncalcification from the surrounding porewater, the 813Cf0ram reflects porewater S13Cdic\\nand taxa living in a deep infaunal habitat generally have more depleted 813C values\\nthan those species living in a shallow infaunal habitat (e.g. McCorkle et al., 1990;\\nBuzas et al., 1993; McCorkle et al., 1997; Mackensen et al., 2000; Tachikawa &\\nElderfield, 2002; Schmiedl et al., 2004). This is known as a microhabitat effect.\\n1\\nPorewater 8 C gradients are site specific and primarily dependent on the carbon rain\\nrate and the sediment depth at which organic matter decomposes (McCorkle et al.,\\n1985). Depletions of up to (and at times exceeding) l%c cm\"1 are common for deep-\\nsea sites (e.g. McCorkle et al., 1985; McCorkle & Emerson, 1988; Martin et al., 2000;\\n215\\nChapter 6 Isotopic compositions in modern benthic foraminifera\\nTachikawa & Elderfield, 2002), and steeper gradients are often seen in reducing\\nenvironments due to shallower O2 penetration into the sediments (McCorkle &\\n1 T\\nEmerson, 1988). Oxygen penetration depth is of importance to the porewater 8 C\\nprofile (McCorkle & Emerson, 1988) and has been found to have a close relationship\\nto organic carbon flux rate. In deep sea environments, the flux rate of organic carbon\\n(Corg) to the sea floor (Altenbach et al., 1999) and the rate of Corg degradation\\ndecreases with increasing water depth, with sediments receiving low Corg generally\\nhaving deeper oxygen penetration (Sauter et al., 2001).\\n6.1.6 Use of benthic foraminiferal stable isotopes in palaeoceanography\\nCibicides wuellerstorfi and Uvigerina peregrina are two benthic foraminifera species\\ncommonly used to construct palaeoceanographic records (e.g. Zahn et al., 1986), since\\n1 n\\nthe first is thought to calcify close to isotopic equilibrium with the 8 Cdic of seawater\\n1 R\\nand the latter species calcifies close to seawater 8 O (Shackleton, 1974). Neither\\nspecies were found to be present in Loch Sunart sediments (see chapter 5), thus the\\nabundant epifaunal species Cibicides lobatulus was selected to obtain Loch Sunart\\npalaeoisotope records (chapter 8).\\nAlthough C. wuellerstorfi is commonly accepted as calcifying close to isotopic\\nequilibrium with the seawater 813Cdic (e.g. Woodruff et al., 1980; Belanger et al.,\\n1981; Graham et al., 1981; Grossman, 1984a; Wilson-Finelli et al., 1998; Tachikawa\\n& Elderfield, 2002), studies show deviations (both enriched and depleted with respect\\nto equilibrium 813Cdic) of as much as 1 %c from isotopic equilibrium for other species\\nof Cibicides (e.g. McCorkle et al., 1997; Mackensen et al., 2000; Schmiedl et al.,\\n2004), and it is possible that Loch Sunart C. lobatulus may display a 813C offset.\\nA number of studies report a tendency for Cibicidoides species to calcify in isotopic\\n10\\ndisequilibrium with respect to theoretical equilibrium 8 O calcite, exhibiting\\nconsistently negative A8lsO values of up to -1%c, i.e. depleted S180 with respect to\\nequilibrium calcite (e.g. Woodruff et al., 1980; Belanger et al., 1981; Graham et al.,\\n1981; Vilks & Deonarine, 1988; Rathbum et al., 1996; McCorkle et al., 1997; Scott et\\nal., 1998; Schmiedl et al., 2004; Scourse et al., 2004). Despite the test morphology of\\nCibicides (plano-convex) suggesting an epibenthic habitat (Corliss, 1985a) and\\n216\\nChapter 6 Isotopic compositions in modern benthic foraminifera\\nobservations of Cibicides species living in true epibenthic habitats (i.e. epilithic or\\nepiphytic), Bornmalm et al., (1997) observed a preference for a very shallow infaunal\\nhabitat for C. pachyderma in laboratory experiments, with individuals forming \\'cysts\\'\\nwithin the sediment around them. McCorkle et al., (1990) found specimens of C.\\nlobatulus from the deep-sea had A5lsO of around -0.7 %c and McCorkle et al., (1997)\\nsuggested the isotopic composition of C. lobatulus from the California continental\\nmargin was likely influenced by \\'vital effects\\' and questioned whether the species is\\ntruly epibenthic. Rathburn et al., (1996) also attributed isotopic differences between\\ndeep-sea Cibicidoides species and Cibicides bradyi to a transitional (0-4cm) habitat\\ndepth for C. bradyi. Conversely, Bemis et al., (1998) recently demonstrated that\\ndeep-sea core-top Cibicidoides from the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian Oceans and the\\nArabian Sea and Gulf of Mexico appeared to calcify close to oxygen equilibrium\\ncalcite, and Lynch-Stieglitz et al., (1999) showed Cibicidoides specimens calcified\\nclose to isotopic equilibrium in temperatures of 5-27 °C. Few studies have explored\\nisotopic compositions of modern mid-latitude shelf/fjord benthic foraminifera (e.g.\\nScourse et al., 2004), and it is particularly important to ascertain the degree of oxygen\\nisotope disequilibria in taxa used to obtain palaeoisotope records. For instance,\\napplying a 0.2 %o correction to account for an apparent \\'vital effect\\' which may\\nactually derive from the palaeotemperature used (e.g. the difference in A5lsO when\\napplying the O\\'Neil et al., 1969 and Bemis et al., 1998 equations), may produce an\\nerroneous temperature offset of ~ 1 °C.\\n6.2 Aims and methods\\nThis chapter aims to investigate the stable isotopic compositions of modern benthic\\nforaminifera from the surface sediments of Loch Sunart in order to:\\ni) determine major ecological influences (i.e. temperature, salinity or\\ndepth habitat) on test composition of common species found in\\nLoch Sunart;\\nii) establish the degree of isotopic disequilibria in modern Cibicides\\nlobatulus from Loch Sunart. This is important because C. lobatulus\\nis used to provide the palaeoisotope record for cores GC023 and\\nSC023.\\n217\\nChapter 6 Isotopic compositions in modern benthic foraminifera\\nOxygen and carbon isotopic analyses were carried out on four benthic foraminifer\\nspecies; Ammonia beccarii, Cibicides lobatulus, Bulimina marginata and Noniella\\nturgida. These species were chosen because they are: a) abundant throughout the sea\\nloch surface sediments; b) represent the species with the greatest number of \\'live\\'\\nindividuals; and c) represent a range of reported depth habitats i.e. epifaunal, shallow\\ninfaunal and deep infaunal (see chapter 4). Additionally, C. lobatulus was used to\\nobtain the isotope record from Loch Sunart cores GC023 and SC023, hence an\\nunderstanding of factors affecting the isotopic composition of this species in the\\nsurface sediments of Loch Sunart should aid the interpretation of down-core isotope\\nrecords.\\n6.3 Results\\nAll stable isotope results are reported relative to Vienna Pee Dee Belemnite (VPDB)\\nusing the NBS-19 standard, and the following equations;\\n5180 (%c) = [(180/160 sample /180/160 standard) - 1] * 1000 (Eq. 2.6)\\n513C (%c) = [(13C/12C sample / 13C/12C standard) - 1] * 1000 (Eq. 2.7)\\n6.3.1 Isotopes from modern foraminifera\\nThe isotopic compositions for all 4 species of benthic foraminifera studied are\\npresented in table 6.1.

The life status of\\nspecimens in the first sample batch (run at Bremen) were unspecified, thus these\\nspecimens could be \\'dead\\' or \\'live\\' and are denoted by \\'U\\'. All samples are\\naccompanied by data on: collection date, station co-ordinates, water depth, bottom\\nwater temperature (BWT) and bottom water salinity (BWS).\\nAmmonia beccarii\\n5180 values for all A. beccarii samples (i.e. live, dead and \\'unspecified\\') are enriched\\nin 180 relative to the 5180 of VPDB, and range from 0.73 %c to 1.66 %c with a mean\\n§180 value of 1.32 ± 0.20 %c.

There appears to be no significant\\ncorrelation between 5180 and 513C for N. turgida from Loch Sunart surface samples\\n(table 6.2).\\n6,3.2 Stable isotopic composition and specimen size\\nTo test whether isotopic compositions of Loch Sunart benthic foraminifera show a\\nrelationship with growth, a number of isotopic analyses were carried out using sample\\nmasses containing differing numbers of A. beccarii and C. lobatulus specimens from\\nthe same sample site, i.e. calcifying under the same environmental conditions.\\nIndividuals were not measured prior to analyses, therefore specimen size was crudely\\nestimated using the ratio of the number of specimens per sample mass (pg), i.e.\\nSpecimen size ratio = number specimens / sample mass (pg) (Eq. 6.7)\\nSamples with a high specimen size ratio contain a greater number of individuals and\\nare likely to contain more juvenile specimens, whereas low ratio samples (few large\\ntests) are more likely to contain specimens at \\'adult\\' stages. Similar sized specimens\\nwere used to \\'create\\' the samples, hence a sample with a high ratio should represent\\nsmall tests, not a mixture of large and small tests. The results seen in table 6.3 are a\\nsubset taken from tables 6.1a and 6.1b.\\n228\\nChapter 6 Isotopic compositions in modern benthic foraminifera\\n1 Q\\nNo significant relationships occur between test size and 8 O for either species (table\\n6.4). C. lobatulus shows a moderate positive and marginally insignificant relationship\\nbetween test size and both 6180 (r = 0.419, p = 0.094) and S13C (r = 0.424, p = 0.09),\\n18 1\\nwhich is likely to be influenced by the strong 5 0:8 C relationships seen in table 6.2.\\n1 O 1-3\\nVariations in 5 O and 5 C for A. beccarii samples (live and dead) containing\\ndifferent test sizes (i.e. different growth stages) range from 0.09 to 0.38 %c and 0.18\\n%o to 1 %o respectively. This agrees well with Vincent et al., (1981) who reported\\nintraspecific S13C and S180 ranges in the order of several tenths of 1 %c for this taxon.\\n13 2\\nA. beccarii shows a strong specimen size:8 C logarithmic relationship with an R\\nvalue of 0.72 (figure 6.4) and a strong significant correlation coefficient of -0.715 (p =\\n0.013, table 6.3). As expected, this relationship weakens to a moderate positive\\nrelationship (r = -0.554, p = 0.003) when more samples (live and dead) are included.\\nInterestingly, the relationship breaks down completely when only live samples are\\nincluded (see table 6.3).\\n6.3.3 Environmental influences on stable isotopic composition\\nTable 6.5 show the Pearson correlation coefficients (r) and p-values for the influence\\nof environmental variables upon the stable isotopic composition of A. beccarii, C.\\nlobatulus, B. marginata and N. turgida. For the majority of samples, bottom water\\ntemperature (BWT) and bottom water salinity (BWS) were obtained at the time of\\nsample collection. For those samples without accompanying hydrographic data, BWT\\nand BWS were interpolated from other stations. Nutrient (phosphate, ammonia,\\nnitrate and silicate) data and dissolved oxygen data were obtained from hydrographic\\nsurveys taken on the 25/5/90, 24-25/7/90, 30/4/91 - 1/6/91, 28/6/91 - 3/7/91 and 5-\\n15/6/91 (data obtained from Fisheries Research Services, Aberdeen). This nutrient\\ndata is only a \\'snapshot\\' view of nutrient values in Loch Sunart bottom waters at a\\ncertain period, hence although they give an idea of \\'typical\\' values, they are not\\nnecessarily indicative of the nutrients in the water column during the lifetime of the\\nforaminifera. Similarly, bottom water temperatures (BWT) and salinities (BWS) and\\n% organic matter assigned to \\'dead\\' (or even \\'live\\') samples may not be comparable\\nto the conditions experienced during calcification. Thus, the most accurate\\nrelationships should be obtained from correlations with \\'live\\' samples.

Fjordic\\nhydrography and sedimentary characteristics generally change with distance from the\\nfjord mouth as it penetrates inland (see chapter 3), for example, salinity becomes\\nfresher towards the head of Loch Sunart, whilst temperatures can show a slight\\ndecrease. Ammonia, phosphate concentrations and % organic matter typically\\nincrease towards the head of the loch, whilst oxygen concentration and saturation\\ndecreases (see figure 6.5). Therefore, the relationship between stable isotopic\\ncomposition of the test and longitude is likely to reflect organic inputs and\\nproductivity in the fjord, as well as the mixing between the inner basin water (which\\n1 t\\nhave a 8 Cdic reflecting the remineralisation of terrestrial organic matter) and coastal\\nwater DIC.\\nCibicides lobatulus\\nLow numbers of available \\'live\\' C. lobatulus in the Loch Sunart samples (chapter 5)\\nmeant the majority of isotopic analyses were run on \\'live\\' (n = 2), \\'dead\\' and\\nspecimens with no life status given.

The 8 O of benthic foraminifera are influenced\\nby vital effects (section 6.3.4), hence although there may be some relationship\\nio\\nbetween 8 O and depth habitat (figure 6.7 and Bemis et al. 1998) it is too complex to\\nbe addressed in this study. Conversely, the relationship between habitat depth and\\n813C is well documented (section 6.1.5.1), thus only 813C will be discussed here.\\nCarbon isotopic compositions (along with the mean values) for all four species can be\\nseen in figure 6.8.

This is in good agreement with Schmiedl et al.,\\n(2004), who reported positive logarithmic correlations between the test size of deep-\\nsea Uvigerina mediterranea (from the Western Mediterranean Sea) and stable isotopic\\ncompositions, which they attributed the enrichment to a slow-down of metabolic\\nactivity in later life stages, as seen in planktonic foraminifera (e.g. Spero & Lea 1996).\\nGrowth in benthic foraminifera tends to slow down after the rapid calcification rates\\nduring the juvenile life stage (Murray 1991), and it is likely that kinetic isotopic\\nfractionation affects test composition (McConnaughey 1989a). The lack of a\\nsignificant 813C: test size relationship for \\'live\\' A. beccarii is likely due to the paucity\\nof \\'small ratios\\' in the data, i.e. samples containing a few large tests rather than a\\nphysiological process. Despite the establishment of a definite size influence on the\\nstable isotopic composition of benthic foraminifera from Loch Sunart being hindered\\nby the paucity of data, it is also possible that the geochemical composition of\\nforaminiferal tests reflect a \\'seasonal effect\\' rather than an ontogenetic effect (section\\n6.4.1.1), and to clearly separate the two influences on test isotopic composition is\\nlikely to be difficult.\\nHowever, large isotopic variations seen between single specimens and multiple\\nspecimen analyses in this study agree with previous suggestions (e.g. Vinot-Bertouille\\n& Duplessy 1973; Boyle 1995) that isotopic analyses are best carried out on samples\\ncontaining either more than one individual or from a homogenised sample in order to\\ngenerate an \\'average\\' value. Intraspecific isotopic compositions from benthic\\nforaminifera can vary by as much as 2 %c (Vinot-Bertouille & Duplessy 1973; Vincent\\net al., (1981), highlighting a need for caution when selecting benthic foraminifera\\nspecimens for isotopic analysis. For instance, the 0.32 %c difference between C.\\nlobatulus 8lsO data using 1 specimen and 6 specimens from sample 210 (table 7.3),\\nequates to a temperature difference of ~ 1.5 °C (Bemis et al. 1998), whilst the 0.13 %c\\n1 8\\n5 O difference between 6 and 20 C. lobatulus specimens yields a smaller potential\\ntemperature error of 0.62 °C. The down-core isotope record for cores GC023 and\\n1 o\\nSC023 were obtained using >5 C. lobatulus specimens, thus variations in 8 O are\\n239\\nChapter 6 Isotopic compositions in modern benthic foraminifera\\nmore likely to reflect changes in environmental conditions rather than possible\\nontogenic or \\'seasonal\\' effects.\\nShelf-seas, notably in the mid to high latitudes, typically experience seasonal heating\\ncycles (chapter 3) and since benthic foraminifera may live from a few months up to a\\nfew years (e.g. Lee et al., 1991), it is possible that the stable isotopic compositions of\\nshelf sea benthic foraminifera record different parts of the seasonal temperature cycle\\n(e.g. Allison & Austin, 2003). This may explain the disparity of results between shelf\\nsea benthic foraminifera (e.g. the Mediterranean and Loch Sunart) appearing to show\\nontogenic effects on isotopic composition, whereas deep-sea taxa living in stable\\noceanographic conditions do not. For example, small A. beccarii captured \\'live\\' in\\nJune are likely to have grown following spring reproduction (chapter 5), thereby\\n1 8\\nrecording isotopically enriched S O associated with cooler BWT (chapter 3). Large\\n\\'live\\' A. beccarii on the other hand, may have grown following reproduction during\\nwarmer autumn BWT the year before collection. Refer to section 8.4.6 for a\\ndiscussion on the \\'seasonal effect\\' in benthic foraminifera.\\n6.4.2 Environmental influences of isotopic composition\\nWhen exploring abiotic influences on shell chemistry, it is advantageous to use \\'live\\'\\nspecimens, since these should be calcifying in the water mass from which\\nhyrdographic data may be collected. The dearth of \\'live\\' specimens in Loch Sunart\\nsurface sediments (chapter 5) hinders the interpretation of isotope values and\\ncorrelations with environmental variables. Additionally, Loch Sunart shows a\\nseasonal temperature cycle (chapter 3) and fjordic hydrography may change quickly\\n(e.g. deep water renewal events), therefore temperature and salinity measurements are\\noften a \\'snapshot\\' of possible conditions in which \\'live\\' foraminifera may have\\ncalcified (section 6.3.3). For example \\'dead\\' deep-sea benthic foraminifera living in\\nstable environmental conditions have been shown to have isotopic compositions\\nsimilar to \\'live\\' specimens from the same sample (e.g. McCorkle et al., 1990),\\nhowever shelf sea benthic foraminifera tend to show more variability (Scourse et al.,\\n1 R\\n2004) with 6 O of \\'live\\' specimens often isotopically heavier than dead specimens.\\n240\\nChapter 6 Isotopic compositions in modern benthic foraminifera\\n6.4.2.1 Temperature and Salinity\\nSince C. lobatulus is used to generate the fossil isotope records from Loch Sunart, the\\ndiscussion will focus on this species. As mentioned previously, low numbers of \\'live\\'\\nC. lobatulus in the data set prohibits the correlation of \\'live only\\' isotopic\\ncompositions and environmental factors, thus all the data presented here uses the full,\\nlarger data sets comprising of \\'dead\\' specimens and specimens which have no\\nspecified life status.\\nC. lobatulus conforms to expected temperature dependent oxygen isotopic\\nfractionation (e.g. Bemis et al. 1998), i.e. isotopic enrichment with cooler BWT,\\n18\\ndisplaying a moderate negative correlation between 5 O and BWT (r = -0.354, p =\\n0.047). A number of samples which may not have been collected live in April have\\nlow BWTs associated with them, and when these April data are removed (the \\'live\\'\\n1 R\\nApril sample remains) the 8 0:BWT strengthens and becomes more significant (r = -\\n0.565, p = 0.006), as does the S180: BWS relationship (r = 0.452, p = 0.016). The\\nsimilar magnitude of these correlation coefficients along with their opposite trends\\n1 R\\nexemplifies how the inter-play of 5 O isotopic fraction due to temperature and\\nsalinity may potentially pose problems regarding the interpretation of palaeoisotope\\nrecords.\\nIf the fossil C. lobatulus 8lsO isotope record is to be used to reconstruct temperatures,\\nthen this \\'interplay\\' must be unravelled. The 0.62 %c range in 8lsO measured in fossil\\nC. lobatulus from core GC023 (chapter 8) reflects either a ~ 3 °C variation in\\ntemperature (Bemis et al., 1998) or a salinity change of around 3.4 (Austin & Inall,\\n2002) or a combination of both. Since BWS appears to remain relatively stable at the\\nmain basin core site (chapter 3), irrespective of DWREs in the inner basin (Gillibrand\\net al., 1995), or extreme climatic forcing (Gillibrand et al., 2005), it is extremely\\nunlikely that main basin BWS would fluctuate by nearly 3.4.\\nOn the other hand, the long-term Millport marine temperature series, which the\\nseasonal temperature cycle recorded in Loch Sunart is strongly coupled with (chapter\\n3), exhibits an inter-annual May-October (typical period of test calcification)\\ntemperature range of 2.66 °C (10.7 - 13.35 °C). This demonstrates that the 5180 of\\nfossil C. lobatulus in Loch Sunart are likely to reflect temperature changes rather than\\n241\\nChapter 6 Isotopic compositions in modern benthic foraminifera\\nsalinity changes. The hypothesis that foraminiferal calcite from Loch Sunart likely\\nreflects temperature changes rather than salinity changes is illustrated in figure 6.9,\\nwhich clearly shows how the seasonal heating cycle of Loch Sunart basin water\\n1 R\\ntranslates into seasonality in the theoretical 5 C>Eq.caco3 curve, and also how inter-\\nannual temperature differences can impact upon 818OEq.caco3- The higher variability\\n1 Q\\nin inner basin 5 0Eq.caC03 highlights the significance of salinity changes associated\\nwith freshwater inputs and DWREs; since the inner and main basin of Loch Sunart\\nshow similar seasonal heating cycles, the gradient between main basin S180 and inner\\n1 R\\nbasin § O could potentially be used to examine past environmental change and\\npalaeocirculation of the inner basin due to climatic forcing.\\n6.4.3 5180:813C relationship in C. lobatulus\\nC. lobatulus is the only species presented here with a significant positive 8180:813C\\nrelationship (r = 0.420, p = 0.017, n = 32), suggesting kinetic fractionation (rather than\\nmetabolic fractionation) dominates during calcification (McConnaughey 1989c), thus\\nthe species is more likely to calcifiy towards isotopic equilibrium with both 8lsO\\nwater and 813C DIC (McConnaughey et al. 1997). This positive 8180:813C\\nrelationship agrees with those previously reported for shelf sea benthic foraminifera\\n(Vinot-Bertouille and Duplessy 1973). Linear positive S180:S13C correlations are\\nthought to reflect incomplete isotopic fractionation largely due to fast growth rates\\n(Vincent et al. 1981), suggesting shelf sea benthic foraminifera grow faster than deep-\\nsea benthic foraminifera, which typically tend towards negative S180:S13C correlations\\n(e.g. Woodruff et al. 1980). This may explain why the isotopic relationships\\npresented here do not agree with those previously reported for deep-sea benthic\\nforaminifera, and also exemplifies the potential of obtaining \\'seasonal\\' records from\\nlaige, mature foraminifera (e.g. Allison & Austin, 2003).\\n6.4.4 Equilibrium calcite\\nThe majority of isotope studies have been carried out on deep-sea benthic foraminifera\\n(see chapter 1), and since C. lobatulus is predominantly a shelf sea species, little\\nliterature exists on the isotopic equilibrium of this species.\\n242\\nChapter 6 Isotopic compositions in modern benthic foraminifera\\nu 1.0\\no 0.5\\n—Main basin\\n-—Inner basin\\n□ \\'Live\\' Cibicides\\nlobatulus\\n01/04/01 31/05/01 30/07/01 28/09/01 27/11/01\\nDate\\n26/01/02 27/03/02 26/05/02 25/07/02\\nFigure 6.9 The theoretical range of equilibrium 5180calcite (518oEqCaC03) in Loch Sunartfor the\\ninner basin (grey line) and the main basin (black line) calculated using equations 5.2 to 5.5 (Hut,\\n1987;Bemis et o/.,1998; Austin & Inall, 2002) and using the temperature and salinity data from\\nmoorings located at 40 m water depth in the main and inner basin (chapter 3). The effect of the\\nseasonal heating cycle (chapter 3) on the 518oEqCaC03 range can be clearly observed. The difference\\nbetween the main basin and inner basin 518oEqCaC03 reflects the differences in BWT and BWS,\\nwith respective values of 10.79 ± 1.93 °C and 32.8 ± 0.7 for the inner basin, and 10.69 ± 2 °C and\\n33.86 ± 0.44 for the main basin.

This similarity supports\\nthe notion that C. lobatulus (both modem and fossil) from Loch Sunart represents the\\n1 q\\n5 Cdic of the bottom water, albeit with the possibility of underestimating the values\\nby up to approximately 0.5-0.7 %o (Mackensen et al., 2000)\\n6.4.4.2 Stable oxygen isotopes\\nGrossman (1984b) and McCorkle et al., (1990) demonstrated that species living in\\nlow oxygen sediments (i.e. deep dwelling infaunal species) tended to be closer to\\noxygen isotopic equilibrium than shallow infaunal taxa. The data shown in figure\\n6.10 agrees with this hypothesis, with the deep infaunal N. turgida showing 8I80\\nvalues closer to isotopic equilibrium than the shallower dwelling taxa, i.e. A. beccarii\\nand B. marginata. The exception is the relatively small disequilibria displayed by the\\nepifaunal species C. lobatulus.\\nData from Loch Sunart benthic foraminifera were expected to resemble results from\\nthe Celtic Sea (shelf sea) rather than data from deep-sea environments. Scourse et al.,\\n(2004) reported a large oxygen isotopic disequilibria for \\'live\\' Celtic Sea C. lobatulus\\n(mean A8lsO of -0.92 ± 0.56 %c) and found \\'live\\' A. batavus (a close relation to A.\\nbeccarii) to calcify close to isotopic equilibrium with S18Owater (ASlsO = -0.05 ± 0.22\\n%c). Conversely, A. beccarii from Loch Sunart show a large oxygen isotopic\\ndisequilibria with a mean A8lsO of 0.495 ± 0.15 %o (which is in good agreement with\\nVinot-Bertouille and Duplessy 1973), whilst C. lobatulus (live and dead) from Loch\\nSunart appear to calcify close to isotopic equilibrium with a mean A8180 of -0.111 ±\\n0.170 %o (for warm BWT). This AS180 value for C. lobatulus lies much closer to\\n1 8\\nisotopic equilibrium with 8 0Eq.caC03 than previously suggested, thereby agreeing\\nwell with the findings of Bemis et al.. (1998) and Lynch-Steiglitz et al., (1999). The\\n244\\nChapter 6 Isotopic compositions in modern benthic foraminifera\\ndifference in calculated A81S0 for these two species is due to the palaeotemperature\\nequation used to calculate equilibrium calcite.\\nWhen the Bemis et al., (1998) equation is applied to the Celtic Sea C. lobatulus data,\\nthe A5180 values move closer to isotopic equilibrium, with A5180 of -0.63 ± 0.56 %c.\\ni o\\nScourse et al., (2004) include, within the calculation of mean average AS O, two C.\\nlobatulus samples (one live and one dead) with negative SlsO and S13C values,\\nhowever Cibicidoides usually show enriched isotopic compositions relative to VPDB\\n(e.g. figure 6.2). The calculated temperature for this sample is ~ 19.5 ±0.1 °C (using\\nboth the O\\'Neil et al., 1969 and the Bemis et al., (1998) equation), which is\\nanomalously high given the quoted observed maximum temperature of 14.2 °C for the\\nsample water depth of 75m in the St Georges Channel. The authors saw no reason to\\nexclude these samples {pers comm., Prof. J. Scourse, 2004), however given the wealth\\nof data showing positive stable isotope values (particularly with 5lsO) for C.\\nlobatulus, along with the unrealistically high calculated temperature from the samples,\\nthese data are likely to be anomalous and could be excluded. Although this does not\\nbring the mean A8lsO as close to isotopic equilibrium as the Loch Sunart C. lobatulus\\ndata, it does shift the Celtic Sea A8lsO to -0.4 ± 0.29 %c (using the Bemis et al., 1998\\nequation).\\n6.4.5 Which palaeotemperature equation to use for C. lobatulusl\\n1 R\\nThe differences between the published A5 O for Cibicidoides spp (and A. beccarii)\\nand the A8lsO found in this study are influenced by the palaeotemperature equation\\nused. Woodruff et al., (1980), Belanger et al., (1981), Graham et al., (1981), Vilks &\\nDeonarine (1988), McCorkle et al., (1990); Rathburn et al., (1996); McCorkle et al.,\\n(1997), Schmiedl ct al., (2004) and Scourse et al., (2004) all use the\\npalaeotemperature equation given by O\\'Neil et al., (1969) to calculate equilibrium\\n5lsO calcite:\\nT (°C) = 16.9 -4.38(5180 foram - 8lsO water) + 0.1(5180 foram - 8180 water)2 (Eq 6.8)\\nThis equation used synthetic carbonates precipitated at temperatures of 0-500°C\\n(largely in water super-saturated with respect to CO3\") to derive a palaeotemperature\\n245\\nChapter 6 Isotopic compositions in modern benthic foraminifera\\n1 R\\nequation. Shackleton (1974) modified this equation and calibrated it to the 8 O of the\\ndeep infaunal species JJvigerina peregrina. The palaeotemperature equation derived\\nby Bemis et al., (1998) on the other hand was obtained through laboratory and field\\nstudies on planktonic foraminifera (using filtered seawater), hence is likely to be more\\n\\'realistic\\'. Bemis et al., (1998) reported that core-top (deep-sea) Cibicidoides agreed\\nwell with the low-light equation (seen in equation 7.4) in temperatures <10°C,\\nwhereas the data from the deep infaunal species Uvigerina peregrina agreed more\\nwith the palaeotemperature equations of Shackleton (1974) and Erez & Luz (1983).\\nThis explains some of the discrepancy found in the comparison of data from Loch\\nSunart and the Celtic Sea data, since Scourse et al., (2004) use the O\\'Neil et al.,\\n(1969) equation, thus the infaunal A. beccarii from the Celtic Sea appears to be close\\nto isotopic equilibrium whilst C. lobatulus has high disequilibria. Lynch-Stieglitz et\\nal., (1999) provide the most recent regression palaetotemperature equation from\\nmodern Cibicidoides and Planulina, which is statistically similar to the laboratory\\n\\'fractionation\\' derived palaeotemperature equations of Kim & O\\'Neil (1997) and the\\nBemis et al., (1998). The calibration of a palaeotemperature equation to empirical\\ndata often results in \\'offsets\\' occurring over a given temperature range (e.g. table 1 in\\nBemis et al., 1998) and these offsets must be taken into account when comparing\\npalaeotemperature equations (pers comm., Dr. U. Ninneman, 2004).\\nThe difference between the Bemis et al., (1998) and O\\'Neil et al., (1969) equations\\nand their respective calculations of isotopic equilibria for the infaunal and epifaunal\\nspecies is likely to be due to a carbonate ion effect down the sediment profile (Bemis\\n1\\net al., 1998). This appears plausible especially since 8 C compositions of benthic\\nforaminifera show that infaunal taxa calcify in different porewater chemistry than\\nepifaunal taxa (e.g. McCorkle et al., 1997). Spero et al., (1997) demonstrate a\\ncarbonate ion (pH) effect on planktonic foraminiferal test isotopic composition, and\\npH has seen to be important in the isotopic fractionation of deep-sea corals (Adkins et\\nal., 2003). Sediment porewater pH profiles do not exist for Scottish fjords, however\\nHanson & Donaghay 1998 show porewater pH profiles in a North American stratified\\ncoastal fjord typically decrease with sediment depth. Since a 0.2 increase in pH is\\nthought to equate to a 8lsO depletion of -0.22 %c (Zeebe, 1999), one would expect the\\n8lsO of deep infaunal taxa to differ from the 8lsO of epifaunal benthic foraminifera.\\nTherefore, using the same palaeotemperature equation to determine the oxygen\\n246\\nChapter 6 Isotopic compositions in modern benthic foraminifera\\nisotopic equilibrium of both infaunal and epifaunal taxa which calcify in such\\ndifferent environments is likely to be unrealistic, and could introduce significant errors\\ninto palaeotemperature reconstructions, since 0.22 %c approximately reflects a 1 °C\\nchange. However, few studies have focussed upon the carbonate ion effect in benthic\\nforaminifera and to do so was beyond the means and scope of this project; future work\\ncould expand empirical data in this relatively neglected area.\\nGiven the similarity of the palaeotemperature equations of Kim et al., (1997), Bemis\\net al., (1998) and the Lynch-Stieglitz et al., (1999) and the demonstration by the latter\\ntwo that the Cibicidoides group calcifies close to isotopic equilibrium with the S180 of\\n1 8\\nseawater, we may assume that C. lobatulus from Loch Sunart reliably records the 8 O\\nsignal of the bottom water. The Lynch-Stieglitz et al., (1999) equation rather than the\\nBemis et al., (1998) equation is used in this study as the BWT range experienced in\\nLoch Sunart falls within the studied temperature range (5-27 °C ) of Lynch-Stieglitz et\\nal., (1999), and this equation yields the smallest difference between observed\\ntemperature and predicted temperature for C. lobatulus (figure 6.11).\\nThe demonstrated low disequilibria of Cibicidoides group using species specific\\npalaeotemperature equations such as Bemis et al., (1998) and Lynch-Stieglitz et al.,\\n(1999) has implications for future isotopic work on benthic foraminifera. The near-\\nisotopic equilibrium of this species to both theoretical 5180Eq.caC03 and 813CDic would\\nenable a complete \\'view\\' (or reconstruction) of bottom water geochemistry to be\\ngained, rather than relying on taxa living within the porewater environment.\\nAdditionally, future laboratory and research costs could be significantly reduced since\\nonly one species, Cibicidoides, could be used to obtain both the S180 and a 8°C\\nisotope record, which additionally, is measured simultaneously on the mass\\nspectrometer.\\n6.4.6 Seasonal effect in benthic foraminifera\\nScourse et al, (2004) reported a seasonal effect in isotopic data from Celtic Sea\\nbenthic foraminifera, with foraminifera typically calcifying during periods of the year\\nwith warmer bottom waters.

Cytoplasm from benthic foraminifera living in infaunal habitats have\\nbeen shown to retain rose Bengal staining several months following death, with\\ncytoplasm generally decomposing at a slower rate in low oxygen conditions (Jorissen\\net al., 1995), however this is unlikely to explain the temperature differences seen in\\nfigure 6.12.

This suggests benthic foraminifera from Loch\\nSunart tend to calcify during peak BWT in October/November/December, which\\nagrees well with the findings of Scourse et al., (2004). Benthic foraminifera from\\nNorwegian fjords have also been found to calcify around November (pers. comm., Dr.\\nG.

The porewater profile is from a station CH90-BC5\\n(McCorkle et al. 1997), a deepwater site (1477m) on the NE American continental\\n1 -3\\nmargin. It is acknowledged that 8 C porewater gradients are likely to differ in fjordic\\nenvironments (section 6.1.5); this profile was used due to the bottom water 813C being\\ncomparable to that suggested for Loch Sunart (via the mean S13C from C. lobatulus).\\n1-3 1-3\\nAlthough a fjordic 8 C porewater profile may be steeper, the mean 8 C from Loch\\nSunart benthic foraminifera fit well on the curve with respect to species reported\\nliving depths (chapter 5) and the depth of the sediment layer obtained for sampling (1-\\n1.5 cm).\\n251\\nChapter 6 Isotopic compositions in modern benthic foraminifera\\n813C, %o\\n-2.5 -2 -1.5 -1 -0.5 0 0.5 1 1.5\\nFigure 6.13.

The C. lobatulus specimens from Loch Sunart have the most\\npositive (enriched) 513C values (mean 813C of 1.27 ± 0.44 %c) of the benthic species\\n1 o\\nstudied here, suggesting the shallowest habitat depth (figure 6.13). Since the 5 C of\\n1\\nCibicidoides taxa is likely to reflect the 5 C of bottom water (sections 6.1.5 and\\n1 T\\n6.4.5.1), this suggests Loch Sunart bottom waters are likely to have an average 8 CDic\\nof 1.27 ±0.44 %c.\\nBulimina marginata\\nThe mean S13C value of Bulimina marginata points to a relatively shallow habitat\\ndepth (figure 6.13), which agrees well with Buzas et al., (1993) and Gustafsson &\\nNordberg (2001), who placed B. marginata as a shallow infaunal species living at the\\nsediment-water interface. Mackensen et al., (2000), suggested Bulimina aculeata (and\\npossibly other Bulimina taxa) are extremely mobile within sediments, seeking optimal\\nmicro-environmental conditions. McCorkle et al., (1997) suggested that near-constant\\ni o\\n8 C isotopic signal seen with sediment depth for species such as B. aculeata may\\nreflect calcification in a small sub-zone of the microhabitat range. Hence, although\\nthe 813C values presented here for B. marginata suggest a shallow infaunal habitat\\n(figure 6.13), this may represent the calcification depth of the species and not\\nnecessarily the living depth.\\nAmmonia beccarii\\nBuzas et al., (1993) showed a summary of the sediment depths at which A. beccarii\\nand A. batavus have been found living and due to the wide range of depths, they\\nconcluded that a definite microhabitat for this taxa could not be established. Loch\\nSunart A. beccarii has S13C values with a mean of -1.31 ± 0.19 %c, suggesting an\\nintermediate infaunal habitat (figure 6.13).\\nNoniella turgida\\nN. turgida has an average 813C value of -1.85 ± 0.14 %c representing the most depleted\\ncarbon isotopic composition of the 4 taxa, hence the deepest living habitat (figure\\n6.13). N. turgida tests are often coloured yellow, which may be indicative of\\n253\\nChapter 6 Isotopic compositions in modern benthic foraminifera\\nchloroplast husbandry and Bernhard & Bowser (1999) showed that Noniella\\nlabrodorica and N. stellata (close relations to N. turgida) sequestered chloroplasts in\\noxygen depleted environments. Gustafsson & Nordberg (2001) also found a\\nsignificant positive moderate correlation between N. turgida populations and\\nchlorophyll a. Phytoplankton tend to have depleted S13C values (~ -20 %o) due to the\\n12\\npreferential uptake of the lighter CO2 during photosynthesis (Rohling and Cooke\\n1999). If N. turgida in Loch Sunart surface sediments are indeed sequestering\\n1 o\\nchloroplasts, then the depleted 5 C values seen in the test carbonate could be\\ninfluenced by the assimilation of isotopically light 513C from the phytoplankton, hence\\n1 T\\nthe 8 C values may not be reflecting true microhabitat depth but rather influences of\\nmetabolic isotopic fractionation.\\n7 ?\\n6.4.7.2 Estimating porewater S C gradients for Loch Sunart\\nIf C. lobatulus reflects the 813C of the bottom water and N. turgida is the deepest\\ndwelling taxon, then the observed bottom water - porewater 813C difference (A813C)\\ncan be calculated for the top 1 - 1.5 cm of Loch Sunart surface sediments by;\\n13 13 13AS C — mean 8 C Cibicides lobatulus \" 8 C Noniella turgida (Ecj 6.9)\\nThis gives a mean A813C of ~ 3.12 %c, which is steeper than the majority of deep-sea\\nopen ocean sites (see above), but comparable to sites from the western North Atlantic\\nwith similar bottom water compositions and shallow oxygen penetration (McCorkle &\\nEmerson 1988).\\nAll the Loch Sunart benthic foraminiferal taxa in this study exhibit negative\\ncorrelations between S13C and water depth (table 5.5), particularly C. lobatulus (r = -\\n0.722, p = 0.043), thus porewater A813C gradients should decrease with increasing\\nwater depth (see figure 6.14). This relationship of depleted 813Cc. lobatulus and thus\\n1 T\\ndecreasing A8 C, with increasing water depth is likely due to increasing apparent\\noxygen utilisation (AOU) from benthos respiration and organic matter\\nremineralisation (e.g. Belanger et al., 1981; Graham et al., 1981 and Kroopnick,\\n1985). On the other hand, organic carbon (Corg) flux rate and degradation typically\\ndecreases with increasing water depth, resulting in less depleted 813C being released\\n254\\nChapter 6 Isotopic compositions in modern benthic foraminifera\\ninto sediment porewater via decomposing organic matter (Altenbach et al. 1999;\\nSauter et al. 2001). However, given the strength of the C. wuellerstorfi §13C: AOU\\nrelationship, the probability that C. lobatulus from Loch Sunart is in isotopic\\nequilibrium with 513C DIC, and the strength of the 813Cc.iobatuius: water depth\\nrelationship, it is likely that the 513C of C. lobatulus is reflecting the increased AOU at\\nwater depth, with increased AOU occurring during times of high marine productivity.\\n6.4.8 Implications for palaeoreconstructions\\n6.4.8.1 Reconstructingpast bottom water oxygen concentrations\\nWhilst Loch Sunart experiences regular renewal of basin water with coastal waters\\n(Gillibrand et al., 1995), the water column is likely to show slightly depleted 813C\\nvalues with respect to coastal waters due to the consumption of oxygen in this\\nrelatively restricted coastal environment (see above). For example, Gillibrand et al.,\\n(1996) demonstrated the depletion of bottom water oxygen concentration during a\\nstagnant period in Loch Ailort, with oxygen replenishment occurring during renewal\\nevents. The main basin of Loch Sunart appears to be less responsive than the inner\\nbasin to climatic forcing (Gillibrand et al., 2005) and there is little seasonal difference\\nin dissolved oxygen content and AOU around the west coast of Scotland (Boyer et al.,\\n1999), hence the 813C of C. lobatulus is likely to reflect 5i3Cdic arising from the\\nadmixture of the fjord waters and open ocean waters of the Atlantic\\nMcCorkle et al., (1990) suggested that the A8I3C gradient between C. wuellerstorfi\\nand the deep infaunal Globobulimina affinis may provide an estimate of past bottom\\nwater oxygen concentrations. Although the exact microhabitat of N. turgida and it\\'s\\nrelation to oxygen penetration cannot be verified for Loch Sunart, McCorkle et al.,\\n(1990) suggest deep-sea Noniella have a microhabitat similar to G. affinis (i.e.\\ninhabits the zone where oxygen concentration = 0), and the 813C values for Loch\\nSunart N. turgida do suggest a deeper infaunal habitat than for instance, B. marginata\\n(figure 6.13). Future comparison of the A813C between C. lobatulus and N. turigda\\nmay provide a means of investigating past bottom water oxygen concentrations in\\nLoch Sunart throughout time. This may be invaluable to understanding the natural\\nventilation of the loch, it\\'s link to climate change (e.g. Gillibrand et al., 2005) or\\n255\\nChapter 6 Isotopic compositions in modern benthic foraminifera\\nresponse to anthropogenic forcing, given the economic dependence of fish farms on\\nsuch fjordic environments (e.g. Gillibrand & Turrell, 1997).\\n13 • • • •6.4.8.2 Ad C and the potentialfor reconstructing palaeoproductivity\\nOrganic carbon from deep-sea environments tends to degrade within the top few mm\\'s\\n(Sauter et al., 2001). B. marginata appears to inhabit a depth close to the sediment-\\nwater interface (figure 6.13) and likely reflects the net rate of diagenetic carbon\\nrelease to the porewater from organic matter decomposition (McCorkle et al., 1997).\\nZahn et al. (1986) reported a relationship between accumulation rates of organic\\ncarbon in NE Atlantic sediments and the A813C of the epifaunal C. wuellerstorfi and\\nthe shallow infaunal Uvigerina peregrina. Mackensen et al. (2000) also suggested\\nthat A813C gradients between epibenthic species such as Cibicidoides species and\\nBulimina species could act as a proxy for palaeoproductivity, with porewater 813C\\nbecoming isotopically depleted at localities with fresh phytodetritus accumulations\\n(Mackensen et al.. 1993), i.e. the \\'Mackensen Effect\\'. B. marginata and C. lobatulus\\nare common throughout Loch Sunart surface sediments and are preserved well within\\nsedimentary archives (see chapter 5). Paired isotopic analyses of these species may\\nprovide a record of palaeoproductivity in Loch Sunart, and although this was not\\nachievable within the scope of this project, preliminary data shows an insignificant\\n(probably due to low sample number) strong positive relationship between A813C C.\\nlobatulus : B. marginata and % organic carbon (figure 6.15).

By using palaeotemperature equations calibrated\\n1 8\\nwith empirical 8 O data from epifaunal Cibicidoides taxa (Bemis et al., 1998 and\\nLynch-Stieglitz et al., 1999) rather than infaunal taxa, C. lobatulus from Loch Sunart\\nwas found to calcify much closer to 8180Eq.caco3 than previously reported (e.g.\\nScourse et al., 2004) with a A8lsO of -0.11 ± 0.17 %c. N. turgida also calcified fairly\\nclose to isotopic equilibrium (using the Bemis et al., 1998 equation) with a A8lsO of\\n0.17 ± 0.3 %c, whilst both A. beccarii and B. marginata displayed large A8lsO\\ndisequilibria with S180Eq.caC03 with A8lsO of 0.5 ± 0.15 %c and 0.69 ± 0.12 %c\\nrespectively. An explanation for the disparity between the relatively small C.\\nt o\\nlobatulus A8 O presented here and the large disequilibria reported in other studies, is\\nlikely due to the palaeotemperature equation used. Studies reporting a large A8lsO\\ntypically use the O\\'Neil et al., (1969) equation calibrated using infaunal taxa, and\\nchanges in porewater chemistry, e.g. pH, are likely to impact upon test S180 of\\ninfaunal benthic foraminiferal species (e.g. Spero et al., 1997 and Zeebe, 1999). Thus\\nthis study has exemplified the need for authors to take care when selecting a 8180:\\ntemperature equation to derive palaeotemperature from fossil benthic foraminifera.\\nAdditionally, the small oxygen and carbon isotopic disequilibria reported here for C.\\nlobatulus (or Cibicidoides spp.) has implications on future project costings, since the\\nestimation of bottom water S|8Osmow and 813CDic can be determined from only one\\nspecies, thus significantly reducing laboratory costs.\\nLoch Sunart C. lobatulus 8lsO typically display a negative correlation with BWT and\\na positive correlation with BWS. The 0.62 %c S180 range in fossil C. lobatulus from\\nLoch Sunart core GC023 (chapter 8) reflects either a ~ 3 °C variation in temperature\\n(Bemis et al., 1998) or a salinity change of around 3.4 (Austin & Inall, 2002). Salinity\\n258\\nChapter 6 Isotopic compositions in modern benthic foraminifera\\nvariations of this magnitude are extremely unlikely to occur in Loch Sunart, even due\\nto climatic forcing such as the NAO (chapter 3), however the observed Millport\\nmarine temperature series (chapter 3) displays an inter-annual range of 2.66 °C for\\n1 o\\nMay-October averaged temperature. Thus C. lobatulus 8 O from Loch Sunart is\\nlikely to reflect BWT rather than BWS; an important relationship to determine before\\na palaeo-5lsO isotope record is interpreted. Additionally, differences in predicted\\n(calculated using the Lynch-Stieglitz et al., 1999 palaeotemperature equation) and\\nobserved bottom water temperatures (BWT) for C. lobatulus specimens likely\\ncollected \\'live\\' in winter, exhibit predicted BWT 3-5°C higher than recorded at the\\nsite during sampling. This suggests that C. lobatulus in Loch Sunart exhibit a\\n\\'seasonal effect\\' (Scourse et al., 2004), possibly calcifying in the warm BWT during\\nOctober/November; a period when benthic foraminifera from NW Norwegian fjords\\ntypically reproduce (pers. comm., Dr. G. Mikalsen, 2004). Thus palaeotemperature\\nderived from C. lobatulus will reflect summer BWT; the variable reconstructed using\\nthe transfer function approach of Sejrup et al., (2004).\\n259\\nChapter 7 Quantitative palaeoenvironmental reconstructions\\nChapter 7 - A Benthic foraminiferal Transfer Function Approach to\\nReconstruct Scottish west coast fjordic palaeoenvironments\\n7.1 Introduction\\nA major aim of palaeoenvironmental research is to reconstruct past climate or\\nenvironmental conditions from proxies (e.g. fossils or sediments) and as\\npalaeoenvironmental research techniques progress and develop, there is a growing\\nneed for the quantitative reconstruction of palaeoenvironmental variables rather than\\nqualitative interpretations (Birks, 2003). Quantitative data are required for input into\\ngeneral circulation models and for the implementation of climate policies.\\nQuantitative palaeoenvironmental reconstructions can be obtained through the\\nunderstanding of present ecological responses of a biological proxy to environmental\\nvariables via statistical techniques, followed by the creation of a statistical\\nmathematical model (such as a transfer function) which can reliably reconstruct the\\ndesired environmental variable. Such methods are discussed in chapter 2; useful\\nreviews of quantitative environmental palaeoecological techniques are provided by ter\\nBraak (1995) and Birks (1995; 2003).\\nSince the inception of the transfer function method for palaeoenvironmental\\nreconstruction by Imbrie & Kipp (1971) the technique has developed, becoming more\\nsophisticated in it\\'s construction and diversifying both in the type of proxy used and\\nthe range of applications (e.g. Malmgreen et al., 2001). The ubiquitous distribution of\\nbenthic foraminifera in marine sediments, along with the generally good preservation\\nof fossil benthic foraminifera, makes this protozoan an excellent proxy for\\npalaeoenvironmental reconstructions using transfer function techniques (Birks, 1995).\\nBenthic foraminiferal transfer function techniques have been used to reconstruct\\npalaeoproductivity (e.g. Loubere et al., 2003), palaeodepth (Hohenegger, 2005) and\\nsea-level change (e.g. Gehrels, 2000; Gehrels et al., 2002; Edwards et al., 2004;\\nHorton & Edwards, 2005). Palaeoenvironmental reconstructions of ocean salinity or\\ntemperature have, until recently, largely been restricted to marine diatoms and\\nplanktonic foraminifera (e.g. Koci & Jansen, 1994; Birks & Koc, 2002; de Vernal et\\nal., 2002; Jiang et al., 2002; Jiang & Eiriksson, 2005; Kucera et al., 2005). However,\\nSejrup et al., (2004) recently published a benthic foraminiferal transfer function to\\nreconstruct bottom water temperature (BWT) and bottom water salinity (BWS). This\\n260\\nChapter 7 Quantitative palaeoenvironmental reconstructions\\ntransfer function uses the Recent Benthic Foraminifera database (RBF); a training set\\nfrom the NW European continental margin (figure 7.1). This transfer function has\\nbeen shown to reconstruct summer (July, August and September) BWT and BWS for\\ntwo eastern North Sea sediment cores fairly well in comparison to the planktonic\\nforaminifera 5lsO record from the same cores.\\n7.1.2 Aims and objectives\\nA basic requirement of using transfer functions to reconstruct palaeoenvironmental\\nconditions is that the training set must include modern surface samples and associated\\ndata which cover the range of environmental variables experienced at the core site in\\nthe past (Birks, 1995). The glacial limit of the Younger Dryas cold event extended\\ninto the upper basin of Loch Sunart (Benn, 1997), thus the main basin core site is\\nlikely to have experienced post-glacial BWTs much colder than can be found in Loch\\nSunart today. Applying a transfer function using a training set comprising of solely\\nmodern Loch Sunart benthic foraminiferal assemblages will result in inaccurate BWT\\nreconstructions since the lowest BWT able to be reconstructed is constrained by the\\ncoldest BWT (11.6 °C) in the modem training set. Therefore there is a clear\\nadvantage to using the Serjup et al., (2004) RBF training, which has long\\nenvironmental gradients for both summer BWT and summer BWS (table 7.1)\\nHowever, applying the Sejrup et al., (2004) transfer function to reconstruct bottom\\nwater temperature (BWT) and bottom water salinity (BWS) from Loch Sunart fossil\\nbenthic foraminiferal assemblages poses two major problems;\\n1) The minimum salinity in the Sejrup et al., (2004) RBF training set is 33.6 (recorded\\nat the Kattegat sites) which is similar to salinities observed in Loch Sunart main basin\\nbottom waters (table 7.1 and chapter 3). However, the environmental gradient of\\nsummer bottom water temperatures (Ts) must be extended since the maximum Ts of\\nthe Sejrup et al., (2004) RBF training set is 11.99 °C, and summer bottom water\\ntemperatures in Loch Sunart can often reach > 12 °C (chapter 3).\\n2) Sejrup et al., (2004) excluded fjordic samples to try and minimise variance in the\\ndata, since fjordic hydrography differs to coastal hydrography due to localised\\n261\\nChapter 7 Quantitative palaeoenvironmental reconstructions\\nLongitude \"E or \"W\\nFigure 7.1.

Thus benthic foraminiferal assemblages from fjords may have\\ndifferent water mass characteristics and ecological responses from other RBF samples\\nwhich are typically influenced by the oceanic currents in the North Eastern Atlantic\\nregion (figure 7.1; pers. comm.., Dr. D. Klitgaard-Kristensen, 2003). Before the\\ntransfer function can be confidently used in Loch Sunart palaeoenvironmental studies,\\nreconstructions must first be compared to modern regional instrumental data to\\nascertain whether the fossil benthic foraminiferal assemblages of Loch Sunart are\\nresponding to the same North Atlantic oceanic climate which influences assemblages\\nin the RBF.\\nTo address these problems, suitable modern benthic foraminiferal assemblages from\\nLoch Sunart surface sediment samples were added to the recent benthic foraminiferal\\n(RBF) database of Sejrup et al., (2004), in order to extend the environmental gradient\\nof the RBF training set. The transfer function was then applied to assemblages from\\nthe upper section (0-13 cm) of Loch Sunart core SC023 (section 2.3.1) which has a\\nresolution of 1.2 years.cm (see section 8.3.2.2 for geochemical data and section\\n8.4.1.1 for a discussion on the age models). This allowed the transfer function\\nreconstructions to be tested via a direct comparison of reconstructed summer BWS\\nand BWT with instrumental marine temperature and salinity records from the coastal\\nwaters of NW Scotland (chapter 3).\\n7.2 Methods\\n7.2.1 Reproducing the transfer function of Sejrup et al., (2004)\\nThe full RBF database (n=634, 65 taxa) was acquired by AGC whilst a pre-doctoral\\nfellow at the Bergen MCTS (see Sejrup et al., 2004 for data). Samples without data\\nwere removed and the database was manipulated following the \\'rules\\' stated in Sejrup\\net al., 2004 (and after personal communication with Dr. D. Klitgaard-Kristensen), that\\nis all samples from water depths shallower than 30 m and deeper than 500 m were\\nremoved, as were assemblages with more than 10 % \\'Other Species\\' and samples\\nfrom fjordic environments. This left the 260 samples included in the published RBF\\ntraining set of Sejrup et al., (2004). Sejrup et al., (2004) removed taxa with less than\\n10 occurences in the database (leaving a reported 55 taxa), however, the prediction\\n264\\nChapter 7 Quantitative palaeoenvironmental reconstructions\\nstatistics and graphical models could not be reproduced when these taxa were\\nexcluded and the models used here include all taxa (appendix 10).\\nIn order to select a transfer function method, detrended correspondence analysis\\n(DCA) and detrended canonical correspondence analysis (DCCA) should be applied\\nto the training set in order to gain an estimate of gradient length of the environmental\\nvariable to be reconstructed, and determine whether linear or unimodal transfer\\nfunctions techniques should be used (Birks, 1995). Sejrup et al., (2004) reported\\ngradient lengths > 2 standard deviations (SD) for DCA axes 1 and 2, which had strong\\nand significant (p < 0.001) relationships with summer bottom water temperature (Ts)\\nand summer bottom water salinity (Ss) respectively. DCCA showed similar patterns\\nto the DCA axes and suggested that Ts and Ss explained 16% and 9% of the variance\\nin the biological data respectively, thus capturing the major gradients of variation in\\nthe modern benthic foraminiferal data (Sejrup et al., 2004). The majority of the taxa\\nwith > 10 occurrences in the training set (n = 55) showed a statistically significant\\nrelationship with Ts with most taxa (n = 36) having a unimodal biological response,\\nwhilst 49 taxa showed a statistically significant mostly unimodal (n = 40) response to\\nSs (Sejrup et al., 2004). The statistical method of weighted averaging partial least\\nsquares (e.g. ter Braak & Juggins, 1993; ter Braak et al., 1993) was selected since\\ngradient lengths exceeded 2 SD, the majority of taxa showed unimodal responses to\\nthe environmental gradients of interest, i.e. Ts and Ss (Birks, 1995) and the modem\\ndata \\'conformed to the numerical assumptions of the method and its underlying\\nmodel\\' (Sejrup et al., 2004).\\n7.2.2 Adding benthic foraminiferal assemblages from Loch Sunart\\nIn order to extend the bottom water temperature gradient (section 7.1.2), three of the\\nthirty-one benthic foraminiferal assemblages from Loch Sunart (chapter 5) were added\\nto the RBF database. These samples were LS-22 (outer basin), LS-80 (upper main\\nbasin), LS-198 (GC023 core site); all from water depths > 30 m. Though the Sejrup et\\nal., (2004) training set did not exclude samples with indications of reworking, many of\\nthe deep sites of Loch Sunart have coarse sediment suggesting high current activity,\\nthus the potential for reworking of the sediments (chapter 5); samples LS-22, LS-80\\nand LS-198 were primarily selected due to fairly low sand contents suggesting\\n265\\nChapter 7 Quantitative palaeoenvironmental reconstructions\\ndeposition in a relatively calm environment. The rich diversity of Loch Sunart benthic\\nforaminiferal assemblages (chapter 5) means that the majority of the samples had to\\nbe excluded since assemblages (particularly those from the \\'calm\\' depositional\\nenvironments of the deep basins) typically exceeded the 10 % \\'Other species\\' cut-off\\n(i.e. species not included in the main taxonomic groups of the training set; Sejrup et\\nal., 2004) by at least 5-10%. The three samples selected for inclusion into the RBF\\ndatabase were samples with a low percentage of \\'Other species\\'; these were\\npercentages of 11.8 %, 6.3 % and 4.0 % for samples LS-198, LS-80 and LS-22\\nrespectively. Out the 55 benthic foraminiferal taxa included in the RBF of Sejrup et\\nal., (2004), 52 were shown to be responsive to Ts and 49 taxa demonstrated a\\nrelationship with Ss, fulfilling a criterion of the transfer function approach to\\npalaeoenvironmental reconstructions. Including Loch Sunart samples with a high %\\n\\'Other species\\' could significantly influence the transfer function model (both the\\nestimates and the predictive power) since these taxa may not respond to Ts or Ss.\\nAdditionally, these samples are representative of the main and outer basin of Loch\\nSunart; inner basin samples were not included because of the restricted connection of\\nthe inner basin water with the coastal water (chapter 3) along with the high proportion\\nof agglutinated taxa (chapter 5). Loch Sunart assemblage counts (chapter 5) include\\naggultinated taxa thus assemblage percentage abundances were recalculated to\\nrepresent only porcelaneous and hyaline taxa. However, the low proportion of\\nagglutinated taxa within these samples (chapter 5) meant counts were typically n >\\n300 for all samples, i.e. deemed to be statistically representative of the environment\\n(Buzas, 1990).\\n7.2.3 Potential problems faced when applying a transfer function model\\nA problem inherent in collaborations between many working groups of researchers is\\ntaxonomic determination (section 2.6.3) and Sejrup et al., 2004 approached such\\nproblems by using a reduced number of taxa, grouping species into generic groups\\n(e.g. Lagena spp.), using Elphidium excavatum (rather than different ecophenotypes)\\nand using Cassidulina laevigata (rather than Cassidulina teretis) to avoid regional\\nmisidentifications. E. excavatum has been grouped together in this study and since C.\\nlaevigata is rare in Loch Sunart surface sediments (chapter 5), this taxonomic problem\\nis unlikely to affect Loch Sunart reconstructions. Gavlenopsis prageri in the training\\n266\\nChapter 7 Quantitative palaeoenvironmental reconstructions\\nset of Sejrup et al., (2004) was identified as Rosalina prageri in chapter 6, and has\\nbeen called G. prageri in this chapter.\\nPercentage abundance data can often produce constrainment problems in ecological\\nstatistics (Prentice, 1980), thus, as with Sejrup et al., (2004), species percentage\\nabundance data were transformed to square roots to account for this and also to\\nstabilise variances and minimise signal-to-noise ratios.\\n7.3 Results\\n7.3.1 Modifying the Sejrup et al., (2004) transfer function model\\nThe addition of the 3 Loch Sunart samples in the RBF database has extended the\\ntemperature gradient of the original RBF database from 11.99°C to 12.51°C (figure\\n7.2a), shifting the mean from 5.57 °C to 5.62 °C (table 7.1). The salinity gradient has\\nnot been extended (figure 7.2b), however mean salinity has shifted slightly from 34.95\\nto 34.94 (table 7.1).\\n7.3.1.1 Temperature\\nThe prediction statistics for the WA-PLS models are shown in table 7.1. Model Tsl\\n(where Ts represents summer bottom water temperature; July-August-September\\naveraged BWT) is the full RBF database (n = 260) plus the 3 Loch Sunart (LS)\\nsamples and the prediction statistics show a fairly poor model with a high RMSEPjaCk\\nof 1.2 °C and a high maximum bias (1.54 °C) in comparison to the Sejrup et al.,\\n(2004; Ts Sejrup) model (table 7.1). Outliers were identified as samples having\\nresiduals greater than the standard deviation of the environmental gradient (Birks,\\n1995; Sejrup et al., 2004). However, Sejrup et al., (2004) omit sample B997-320 with\\na residual (-3.0) which is less than the standard deviation of 3.18 °C. Samples\\nidentified as outliers in Tsl were very similar to the outliers omitted by Sejrup et al.,\\n(2004). Given that Sejrup et al., (2004) ran additional statistical tests on \\'rogue\\'\\nsamples, the published transfer model of Sejrup et al., (2004), where n = 253, was\\nused as a base for the creation of a modified transfer function model. Therefore Ts2\\nrepresents Ts Sejrup et al., (2004) plus the 3 Loch Sunart samples (n = 256).\\n267\\nChapter 7 Quantitative palaeoenvironmental reconstructions\\nA\\ng\\nE\\no\\nV\\n12 1\\n10 -\\n8 -\\n2 1\\n-2\\n• LS-198\\n.\\'•Sw .\\n♦\\n. * ft **» ♦ «* * ♦ ♦<***\\n»♦\\nbV•\\n♦ ♦♦\\n♦♦\\n2 4 6 8 10 12 14\\nMean summer bottom water temperature (°C)\\n36\\n■|T 35.5\\ng\\nE\\no\\nC\\no\\n35 -\\n34.5\\n34\\n33.5\\n33\\n-2\\nJ.\\n♦ ♦\\n♦♦ ♦*LS-\\'98\\n„ LS-80\\n*♦\\n2 4 6 8 10 12 14\\nMean summer bottom water temperature (°C)\\nFigure 7.2 Biplots showing (A) mean summer bottom water temperature and mean winter\\nbottom water temperature and (B) mean summer bottom water temperature and salinity\\nfor samples included in the recent benthic foraminifera database (RBF) of Sejrup etal.,\\n2004 (black diamonds).

Figure modified after Sejrup etal., (2004).\\n268\\nChapter 7 Quantitative palaeoenvironmental reconstructions\\nWA-PLS component 3 was selected from Ts2 as this component has the lowest\\nRMSEPjack (1.09 °C) and the lowest maximum bias (1.15 °C) for the least number of\\ncomponents (table 7.1; ter Braak & Juggins, 1993; Sejrup et al., 2004). Three outliers\\n(samples HM 101-93-1, 9009 and B997-325) were visually identified in the model\\n(figure 7.3a and b) and upon inspection, the residuals (observed temperature -\\npredicted temperature) of these samples were greater than the Ts2 standard deviation\\nof 3.22 °C, thus these samples were omitted (Birks, 1995). The prediction statistics of\\nthe subsequent model, Ts3 (n = 253) appear to perform slightly better than the\\npublished Sejrup et al., (2004) model (Ts Sejrup) with an RMSEPjack of 1.03 °C and a\\nmaximum bias of 1.09 °C (table 7.1). This may be due to the lengthening of the\\ntemperature gradient through the inclusion of the Loch Sunart samples and the\\nplacement of LS-198 on the line of best fit (figure 7.3 c and d).\\n7.3.1.2 Salinity\\nSejrup et al., (2004) presented a summer bottom water salinity (Ss) transfer function\\nusing 260 samples and a 2 component model (table 7.1). No outliers were omitted\\ndespite many samples having residuals greater than the standard deviation of salinity\\n(figure 7.4 and b; Birks, 1995) and although Sejrup et al., (2004) do not fully discuss\\nthis, the samples with high residuals were probably included due to their significant\\ninfluence on the model and good DCCA relationship with bottom water salinity.\\nTherefore the salinity transfer function presented here (Ssl) includes all 260 samples\\nfrom the RBF database plus the 3 Loch Sunart samples (n = 263). Loch Sunart\\nsamples sit at the lower end of the salinity gradient (figures 7.2b and 7.4a). Prediction\\nstatistics suggest a three component WA-PLS model for 263 samples performs\\nslightly better than the two component mode used by Sejrup et al., (2004; table 7.1)\\nand the range of residuals appears to be smaller (figure 7.4b).

These taxa are commonly found in modem\\nLoch Sunart benthic foraminiferal assemblages (chapter 5); an important requirement\\nwhen dealing with quantitative palaeoenvironmental reconstructions (section 2.6.3).\\n7.3.2.1 SC023\\nReconstructed summer bottom water temperature (RBWT) for site SC023 ranges from\\n9.01 - 10.03 °C, with temperatures typically varying by 0.2-0.5 °C and showing a\\ngeneral trend of increasing summer BWT towards the top of the core (figure 7.5).\\nReconstructed BWT using the Sejrup et al., (2004) model (Ts Sejrup) shows the same\\ntrend but with lower temperatures (mean difference of 0.63 °C between Ts3 and Ts\\nSejrup; figure 7.5). The error on the reconstruction is given by the RMSEPjack and is\\n1.03 °C for Ts3 (figure 7.5) and 1.06 °C forTs Sejrup.\\nThe reconstructed summer bottom water salinity (RBWS) ranges from the maximum\\nsalinity of 34.22 near the base of the core, gradually decreasing (with some inter-\\nannual variability) to less saline waters at the top of the core (34.02; figure 7.5). The\\nminimum salinity (33.99) occurs at 3.25 cm, thus the range of reconstructed salinity\\nfor SC023 is 0.22, with an error of 0.17. Again, the Sejrup et al., (2004) model\\nreconstructed salinity (Ss Sejrup) shows the same salinity trends but slightly higher\\nsalinities (by up to 0.099).\\nA strong negative correlation exists between RBWT and RBWS (-0.892, p = 0) with\\ncooler temperatures occurring in higher salinity waters and vice versa (figure 7.5).\\n7.3.2.2 GC023\\nThe RBWT for core GC023 has a larger temperature range than the RBWT for SC023\\n(2.98 °C and 1.02 °C respectively).

Above 80.5 cm, the temperature steadily decreases to a minimum of 8.65\\n°C at the core top (figure 7.6). This is closer to the temperatures seen in core SC023\\n(figure 7.5) but not identical, suggesting a potential loss of core top for GC023\\n(chapter 8).\\nRBWS from core GC023 has a stronger negative correlation to RBWT (r = -0.992, p =\\n0) than in SC023, so that RBWS inversely covaries with RBWT (figure 7.6). Thus,\\nthe cool temperature of the basal sample (290.5 cm) is accompanied by a fairly high\\nsalinity (34.16) whilst the lower part of the core (80.5 - 280.5) shows fairly low\\nsalinities varying around 33.8. Salinity begins to increase from 34.00 at 60.5 cm to\\nthe maximum salinity of 34.30 at the core top (0.5 cm). As with SC023, the Sejrup et\\nal., (2004) transfer functions reconstructed temperatures are approximately 0.7 °C\\ncooler than Ts3 (figure 7.7) and salinities approximately 0.11 greater than Ssl (figure\\n7.8).\\nA fairly rapid shift towards a cooler temperature and increased salinity is observed at\\n160.5 cm depth in core GC023. This is likely due to the fairly low % abundance of B.\\nmarginata at this depth, along with the peak in % E. vitrea, % S. fusiformis and %\\n\\'Other species\\'.\\n7.4 Discussion\\n7.4.1 Applicability of transfer function approach in Loch Sunart\\nThe majority of samples in the RBF database are mostly from shelf regions which are\\ndirectly influenced by \\'open\\' marine water masses and NE Atlantic ocean currents\\n(figure 7.1). Given that fjordic hydrography is significantly influenced by catchment\\nprocesses (chapter 3), the applicability of using a transfer function based upon the\\nSejrup et al., (2004) training set was tested through direct comparison with observed\\ntemperature data from Millport (chapter 3). Unfortunately, recorded salinity data for\\nthe coastal waters of NW Scotland are currently unavailable (pers. comm., Dr. M.\\nInall, 2005), and sea surface salinity data from the Faroe-Shetland Channel (chapter 3)\\ncannot be used to represent inter-annual changes in the BWS of Loch Sunart (pers.\\n274\\nChapter 7 Quantitative palaeoenvironmental reconstructions\\ncomm., Dr. B. Turrell, 2005). The reconstruction of bottom water temperature and\\nsalinity for GC023 will be discussed in a wider context in chapter 8.\\n7.4.2 Summer bottom water temperature reconstructions\\nThe transfer function appears to reconstruct Loch Sunart summer bottom water\\ntemperature (RBWT) well, with temperature trends following the Millport summer\\n(JAS) temperature series (figure 7.7).\\n7.4.2.1 Accountingfor error\\nThe error associated with the method is 1.03 °C, i.e. similar to the reconstructed\\ntemperature range (figure 7.7). The RMSEPjack error of Sejrup et al., (2004) is\\napproximately 3.9 % of the temperature gradient length suggesting a robust transfer\\nfunction model when compared to other proxies used to reconstruct summer\\ntemperature which typically have errors of 8-20 % of the gradient. Thus, although the\\nerror is large in comparison to the predicted temperature range, the good agreement\\nbetween observed Millport and predicted temperature suggests the transfer function\\nreliably reconstructs trends in the summer bottom water temperature of the coastal\\nwaters of NW Scotland.\\n7.4.2.2 Differences in temperature range\\nThe RBWT has a smaller inter-annual temperature range (~ 1°C) than the observed\\nMillport temperature range of ~ 2.5 °C (figure 7.7). This, in part, is probably due to\\nthe different responses of surface waters (Millport) and deeper waters (Loch Sunart) to\\nthe seasonal heating cycle, with deeper waters typically showing a lagged response\\nand a much reduced temperature range in comparison to surface waters (figure 2.8;\\nEllett, 1979). This also explains the difference in mean RBWT and Millport\\ntemperatures (9.5 ± 0.3 °C and 13.8 ± 0.7 °C respectively) since the core site lies at\\n120 m water depth and the Millport data represents sea surface temperatures (chapter\\n3).\\n275\\nChapter 7 Quantitative palaeoenvironmental reconstructions\\nFigure 7.7 Reconstructed summer (July-August-September) bottom water temperature\\n(RBWT) from core SC023 using the 3 component WA-PLS transfer function (Ts3) model shown\\nin figure 7.3 (solid black line) and July-August-September averaged sea surface temperature\\nfrom Millport (grey line). The age model is produced using a combined lead-caesium chronology\\n(see section 8.3.2.2 for geochemical data and section 8.4.1.1 for a discussion on the age model).\\nThe transfer function of Sejrup etai, (2004; black dotted line) is also shown. The RMSEPjac|<\\ndetermined error of 1.03 °C is represented by the black bar; the Sejrup ef a/., (2004) RBWT has a\\nsimilar error of 1.06 °C.\\n276\\nChapter 7 Quantitative palaeoenvironmental reconstructions\\nThe transfer function reconstructs a summer bottom water temperature (Ts) of 9.86 °C\\nfor the SC023 core top (~AD 2001) which is similar to the summer BWT (~9 °C)\\nmeasured between 1973-77 at 120 m water depth at a site west of Barra Head on the\\nHebridean shelf Ellett, 1979). This is cooler than 10.4 °C observed at the core site in\\nJune 2002, though June lies on the rising limb of the heating cycle and summer BWT\\nduring the later summer months are likely to have been -0.5 °C higher (Ellett, 1979).\\nHowever the Scottish mainland air temperature (SMT) series shows that the summer\\n(JAS) of 2001 was slightly cooler than 2002, thus Loch Sunart BWT may have also\\nbeen cooler (chapter 3). Additionally, measured July BWT from the main basin of\\nLoch Sunart varied by 1.82 °C from 1990 to 1991 (CTD cast data from Dr. P.\\nGillibrand, FRS) exemplifying the significant inter-annual variability of summer\\ntemperature in Loch Sunart main basin bottom waters. The transfer function appears\\nto be reliably recording trends in summer bottom water temperatures in Loch Sunart,\\nalbeit potentially underestimating BWT by approximately - 0.25 - 0.5 °C.\\n7.4.2.3 Inherentproblems in the training set\\nAn additional influence on reconstructed Loch Sunart summer BWT may be the\\nenvironmental gradient of the training set. The inclusion of Loch Sunart samples in\\nthe Sejrup et al., (2004) training set does extend the temperature gradient towards\\nslightly warmer temperatures (table 7.1), however only 21 out of the 253 samples\\n(largely from the Kattegat/Skaggerak and the North Sea) used in the transfer function\\nmodel have summer BWTs greater than 10 °C (figure 7.2a). A major requirement of a\\ntraining set is that it is representative of the likely range of past environmental\\nvariables (section 2.6.3; Birks, 1995) thus the position of the modern Loch Sunart\\nsamples at the end of the temperature gradient (figure 7.3) along with the general\\nunder-representation of warm (>10 °C) samples may hinder the reconstruction of\\nLoch Sunart temperatures since inverse methods (such as WA-PLS) typically perform\\nbetter when unknown (i.e. fossil) samples are from a large central part of the training\\nset distribution (ter Braak, 1995). Ideally, to estimate the optima and tolerances of\\nspecies, the optima of the taxa should lie well within the range of environmental\\nvalues (e.g. ter Braak & Looman, 1986) otherwise \\'shrinking\\' of the environmental\\ngradient can occur (Marchetto, 1994). A few of the dominant taxa (such as A.\\n277\\nChapter 7 Quantitative palaeoenvironmental reconstructions\\nbeccarii) in Loch Sunart benthic foraminiferal assemblages exemplify this problem,\\nsince maximum abundances appear to correlate with higher BWT (chapter 5; figure\\n5.9). However, since the transfer function reconstructs higher temperatures (-11 °C)\\nfor GC023, it is likely that the lower RBWT of SC023 is a function of changing\\nhydrography rather than constraints of the model. Also, the WA-PLS method\\naccounts for this problem via a deshrinking regression step (ter Braak & Juggins,\\n1993), thus \\'shrinking\\' of the environmental gradient shouldn\\'t be a major problem.\\n7.4.2.4 Basin water response to climatic forcing\\nThough the transfer function model Ts3 may slightly under estimate summer bottom\\nwater temperature, and is accompanied by an error similar to the range of temperature\\nvariation, the good agreement with the observed Millport temperature data and thus\\ncoastal sea surface temperature data (chapter 3), suggests that fossil benthic\\nforaminiferal assemblages in Loch Sunart are recording the summer marine\\ntemperatures of the NE Atlantic coastal waters.\\nThe North Atlantic Oscillation significantly influences NE Atlantic climate and\\noceanography (chapter 3 and Blindheim et al., 2000; Holliday, 2003) and observed\\nbottom water temperatures at two coastal stations on the Norwegian coast show a\\nstrong relationship with the NAO (figure 7.1; Sejrup et al., 2004). Hence it is likely\\nthat the summer bottom water temperature of Loch Sunart also responds to NAO\\nforcing (chapter 3), and it may be possible to resolve NAO-influenced palaeoproxy\\nrecords from the high resolution palaeoenvironmental reconstructions of Loch Sunart.\\n7.4.3 Salinity\\n7.4.3.1 Overestimating summer bottom water salinity\\nReconstructed summer bottom water salinities (RBWS) are mostly greater than 34\\n(figure 7.8), however CTD casts taken at the core site in June/July of 1990, 1991,\\n2000 and 2002 show salinities of 33.85 - 33.96, i.e. RBWS is typically overestimated\\nby - 0.1 - 0.3. Seasonal salinity in sea loch environments is typically more variable\\nthan temperature (chapter 3), though it is unlikely that the reconstructed - observed\\nmain basin salinity differences are an artefact of the sampling periods, since main\\n278\\nChapter 7 Quantitative palaeoenvironmental reconstructions\\n01\\nE\\nE\\nrs\\nv)\\n~o\\nQJ\\nC\\no\\nu\\nai\\ncc\\n34.4\\n34.3\\n34.2\\n34.1\\n34\\n33.9\\n-RBWS\\n\\'\\nSejrup\\nFSC salinity anomalies\\n1986 1988 1990 1992 1994 1996\\nDate\\n1998 2000\\n-0.1\\n-0.08\\n-0.06\\n-0.04\\n-0.02\\n0\\n0.02\\n0.04\\n0.06\\n0.08\\n0.1\\n2002\\ni/i\\nn\\nQJ\\nZS\\no\\nFigure 7.8 Reconstructed summer (July-August-September) bottom water salinity (RBWS) for\\ncore SC023 using the 3 component WA-PLS transfer function (Ss1) model shown in figure 7.4\\n(black solid line) and salinity anomaly data (grey line) from the Faeroe-Shetland Channel (FSC;\\ndata from Dr.W.Turrell, FRS). The age model is produced using a combined lead-caesium\\nchronology (see section 8.3.2.2 for geochemical data and section 8.4.1.1 for a discussion on\\nthe age model). Note that FSC salinity anomalies cannot be used to represent likely inter-annual\\nBWS experienced in the deep basins of Loch Sunart (pers.comm., Dr. B.Turrell, 2005), however,\\nsome similarity exists between inverted F-S salinity anomalies (right hand axis; see text for\\ndiscussion).

As with RBWT, the\\noverestimation of RBWS may be due to disparity in the distribution of training set\\nsamples along the salinity gradient (figure 7.4) with only 19 samples (out of 263)\\nhaving salinities < 34, thus the likely range of Loch Sunart summer bottom water\\nsalinities is under-represented in the training set (see above discussion on problems of\\ntemperature reconstructions at the limits of an environmental gradient in a training\\nset).\\n7.4.3.2 Comparison of reconstructed BWS with observed BWS\\nThe lack of observational salinity data for Scotland\\'s coastal waters (chapter 3) makes\\ncomparison with the Loch Sunart reconstructed summer bottom water salinity\\n(RBWS) difficult. The trend of decreasing RBWS (figure 7.5 and figure 7.8) is\\nconcurrent with recent reports of decreasing salinity in North Atlantic waters (e.g.\\nBlindheim et al., 2000; Hansen et al., 2001) and it is interesting to note that the trends\\nin the RBWS appear to covary with Faroe-Shetland Channel (FSC) salinity anomalies\\n(from 800 dbar) when the axes of the latter are inverted (figure 7.8). Though the FSC\\ndata shows shifts towards positive anomalies, these are superimposed on a general\\nlong-term freshening trend (Turrell et al., 1996), hence the inversion of the axes to\\nrepresent similar surface ocean freshening as reported in Blindheim et al., (2000).\\nIncidently, recent positive salinity anomalies in the FSC may occur due to enhanced\\ncurrent activity in the North Atlantic region in response to the NAO (e.g. Blindheim et\\nal., 2000; Holliday, 2003). Comparison of Loch Sunart salinity and FSC data is\\nfurther complicated due to the differences in observational water depth (FSC data\\nobtained from 800dbars ~ 800 m) and sampling locations. Freshwater inputs from the\\nsurrounding catchment play an important role in determining fjordic salinity (e.g.\\nFarmer & Freeland, 1983; Gillibrand et al., 1995). The prolonged positive NAO\\nphase since the early 1990s dominates North Atlantic climate (chapter 3) and\\nincreased precipitation falling over NW Europe (e.g. Ruprecht et al., 2002) along with\\nchanges in wind strength and direction, may manifest itself in slightly lower main\\nbasin salinities (chapter 3). Bottom water salinity variations, influenced by climatic\\nforcing have implications for interpreting stable isotopic compositions from benthic\\n280\\nChapter 7 Quantitative palaeoenvironmental reconstructions\\nforaminifera, because both temperature and salinity can be significant influences\\n(chapter 6).\\n7.4.4 Comparison of SC023 reconstructions with fossil stable isotope records\\n7.4.4.1 Stable oxygen isotope compositions\\nThe 8lsO record of fossil foraminifera is often used as an indicator for bottom water\\n18 18\\ntemperature or salinity characteristics, with lighter 8 O (i.e. depleted in O)\\n1 R\\nsignifying warmer temperatures and/or \\'fresher\\' salinities and heavier 8 O (enriched\\nin lsO) typically occurring in cooler or more saline waters (chapter 6).\\nWhilst RBWT from core SC023 agrees well with Millport temperature (figure 7.7),\\n1 R\\nthe 8 O measurements from fossil C. lobatulus obtained from the same sample levels\\n(chapter 8) appear at times to be in anti-phase with RBWT, Millport temperature and\\nRBWS (figures 7.9 and 7.10). Anti-phasing between the S180 record and the Millport\\n1 R\\ntemperature series could be attributed to problems in core chronology, however 8 O\\nand RBWT are derived from the same benthic foraminiferal assemblages, thus\\nproblematic chronology is not likely the reason for the anti-phasing.\\n1 R\\nIt is possible that the SC023 8 O record is representing salinity variations rather shifts\\n1 R\\nin temperature with the lighter 8 O indicating decreased salinity (figure 7.10).\\nHowever, a 0.33 %c S180 shift from 0.78 %c in 1993 to 1.11 %c in 1995 would require\\na change in salinity of ~ 1.8 (Austin & Inall, 2002) and a salinity shift of this\\nmagnitude in the main basin is unlikely to occur, even during extreme climatic events\\n(Gillibrand et al., 2005). For example, during the \\'Great Salinity Anomalies\\' events,\\nobserved salinities off Ardmore Point (Sound of Mull), the Rockall Trough and North\\nSea varied by less than 0.15 (Ellett & Edwards, 1983 and Belkin et al., 1998) and\\nmodelled Loch Sunart main basin salinity varies by only 0.02 between two recent\\nextreme NAO years (Gillibrand et al., 2005), though it is acknowledged that the open\\n1 R\\nocean and fjordic regimes are very different. Therefore, while C. lobatulus 8 O\\nundoubtedly reflects the interplay of temperature and salinity influence (chapter 6), it\\nis extremely unlikely that the C. lobatulus 8lsO record of Loch Sunart C. lobatulus\\nsolely records changes in bottom water salinity.\\n281\\nChapter 7 Quantitative palaeoenvironmental reconstructions\\n11.0\\n10.5\\nu\\noT 10.0\\n5\\nITS\\n<D\\nCL 9.5\\nE\\n(p\\nI—\\n9.0\\n8.5\\n8.0\\n0.7 11.0\\n0.8\\nu\\n10.5\\n0.9\\n00\\nO\\naT\\n3\\n(O\\n10.0\\n1.0 f kE\\n£\\n9.5\\n1.1 9.0\\n1.2 8.5\\n1.3 8.0\\n1986 1988 1990 1992 1994 1996 1998 2000 2002\\nDate\\n-R8WT\\n- 5180\\n1.3\\n1.2\\n1.1 ©2,\\n00\\np\\n1.0 ^\\n0.9\\n1986 1988 1990 1992 1994 1996 1998 2000 2002\\nDate\\nFigure 7.9 (A) Reconstructed summer (July-August-September) bottom water temperature (RBWT)\\nfor core SC023 (black line) using the 3 component WA-PLS transfer function model (Ts3) shown in\\nfigure 7.3 and created using the C2 programme (Juggins, 2003), plotted with the stable oxygen\\nisotopic compositions (51sO) of Cibicideslobatulus taken from the same sample depths (grey line).\\n(B) with the 8180 axis inverted.

This suggests that it is more likely that the C. lobatulus 5lsO is\\n1 R\\nresponding to changes in bottom water temperature at the core site since the 5 O\\nvariations reflect the magnitude of observed temperature changes, though the\\ninteraction may be complex (figure 7.9).\\n1R\\n7.4.4.2 Reasons for S O anti-phasing\\n1 o\\nThe main difficulty arising from the hypothesis that 5 O reflects temperature\\nvariations rather than shifts in salinity is that measured 5lsO is often heavier, rather\\nthan lighter, during warmer summers (figure 7.9). From 1991 onwards, the\\ncorrelation between SC023 5180 and RBWT appears tighter when the 5lsO axis is\\ninverted; a pattern also seen in the comparison of measured 5180 and theoretical\\nequilibrium calcite (figure 7.11). C. lobatulus is a species which probably calcifies in\\nlate summer-early autumn (chapter 6), hence the 8lsO inversion is not likely to be due\\ncalcification during a different phase of the seasonal heating cycle (e.g. Scourse et al.,\\n2004).\\nThis 5180 anti-phasing with BWT is not constant throughout time. Between AD\\n1986-1991, SC023 C. lobatulus 5lsO displays the conventional 5180:temperature\\nrelationship of enriched 5180 with cooler water temperatures (chapter 6) and this \\'in-\\nphase\\' 5180: temperature correlation is also seen for core GC023 C. lobatulus 8180\\nand RWBT (chapter 8). Extending the RBWT further back would provide more\\ninformation on the 8lsO: RBWT relationship; however, problems in obtaining lead-\\ncaesium data for the cores during the project inhibited this extended data collection.\\nOcean: atmosphere coupling is typically strong in the N Atlantic (chapters 1 & 3) and\\nthe recent prolonged positive NAO phase is likely to have significantly influenced\\ncoastal water salinity (Holliday, 2003) and sea surface temperatures (chapter 3). Inter-\\nannual variability in the NE Atlantic Ocean currents has been linked to climatic\\nforcing such as the NAO (chapter 1; Dickson et al., 1996; Blindheim et al., 2000;\\nHolliday, 2003) and the response of NW Scottish coastal hydrography to the NAO is\\n283\\nChapter 7 Quantitative palaeoenvironmental reconstructions\\nFigure 7.11 (A) Measured 5180 from fossil Cibicides lobatulus from core SC023 (grey line)\\nand theorectical equilibrium 5180 calcite (Eq.518o calcite) calculated from the observed\\nMillport sea surface temperature series using the equations of Bemis etal., (1998) and\\nAustin & Inall (2002) and assuming a constant salinity of 34.17 (averaged main basin salinity\\nfrom Gillibrand etal., 2005).

Recent C. lobatulus 8 O may reflect an increase\\nin fjordic stratification due to the prolonged positive NAO phase. For example, higher\\nfreshwater inputs (Ruprecht et al., 2002) and surface ocean warming (as seen in the\\nMillport sea surface temperature series) associated with positive NAO phases may\\nlead to enhanced fjordic stratification (section 1.8.2.2). An increase in the stability of\\nthe thermocline (and halocline) in high index NAO phases, may lead to less down-\\nmixing of the warm brackish surface layer, hence slightly cooler BWT, more saline\\nBWS and thus enriched 8lsO in benthic foraminiferal tests and vice versa for negative\\nNAO phases.\\nAdditionally, strongly positive NAO (winter) years are typically accompanied by\\nstronger North Atlantic slope currents (NASC), bringing warmer and more saline\\nwaters of Eastern North Atlantic Central Water (ENACW) origin into the Rockall\\ntrough, whereas during lower NAO index years, the Rockall trough water mass\\nconsists of ENAW and the cooler and fresher waters of the Sub-Arctic Intermediate\\nWater (SIAW) and the Western North Atlantic Central Water (WNAW; Holliday,\\n2003). Thus, during strongly positive NAO years, the mixing of the warm, saline\\nNASC water with the SCC (which also may be stronger during NAO positive winters;\\nKershaw et al., 2004) at locations of vertical mixing on the Hebridean shelf (Craig,\\n1958) is likely to result in the coastal bottom waters entering Loch Sunart being more\\nsaline in comparison to NAO negative years (figure 7.12); even when modified by\\nregional processes such as seasonal heating and freshwater runoff (Ellett & Edwards,\\n1983). This may work to further strengthen fjordic stratification and Loch Sunart\\nmain basin salinity may slightly increase during NAO positive years due to enhanced\\nestuarine circulation (Gillibrand et al., 2005). But if stratification is the dominant\\nprocess here, then how is the good agreement of reconstructed BWT and the Millport\\nmarine temperature series explained?\\nThough seasonal stratification is common in shelf seas, locations with high tidal\\ncurrents can have a mixed water column depending on seabed topography (Ellett &\\nEdwards, 1983); one such region of mixing is located outside the mouth of Loch\\nSunart (Craig, 1958). Loch Sunart basin waters display similar seasonal heating\\ncycles to other marine temperatures from the coastal waters of NW Scotland, thus the\\nbenthic foraminiferal assemblages are likely to record inter-annual variations in\\n285\\nChapter 7 Quantitative palaeoenvironmental reconstructions\\nA) Strongly positive (high index) NAO year high freshwater input\\nVery warm heated surface layer\\nRockall Trough\\nStable stratification\\nresults in less down-\\nmixing of brackish\\nsurface water\\nLoch Sunart main basin\\nGC023/SC023 core site I\\nWarm heated surface layer\\nFjordic basin water\\nSalinity ~ 33\\ndepleted and\\nthermally modified\\nRockall Trough\\ncool and fresher (-35) water\\nMBiM\\ndepleted 8 O\\nCoastal water\\n0\\nSalinity ~ 34\\nHebridean Shelf\\nStratification less stable\\nhence more down-mixing\\nof brackish surface water\\nLoch Sunart main basin\\nGC023/SC023 core site\\nB) \\'Non-extreme\\'or negative (low index) NAO year low freshwater input\\nFigure 7.12 A) During strongly positive NAO years, the Rockall Trough water mass typically\\nconsists of Eastern North Central Atlantic Water (ENCAW) which is warm and salty (Holliday, 2003).\\nMixing of this salty ENCAW with the fresher and warm Scottish Coastal Current (SCC) is likely to\\nlead to a fairly saline coastal water mass.

The salinity: 813C relationship is typically positive with more\\nsaline waters accompanied by enriched 813C values (e.g. Spiker, 1980 and Polyak et\\nal., 2003). Though questions have been raised about the accuracy of the reconstructed\\nSC023 RBWT (section 7.5.3), trends in S13C values from C. lobatulus agree fairly\\nwell with RBWS (figure 7.13), with enriched S13C accompanying more saline RBWS.\\nBetween 1992 - 1996, C. lobatulus S13C appears to be isotopically enriched during\\nlower RBWS; this may reflect the coastal salinity changes associated with the 1990s\\nNorth Atlantic \\'great salinity anomaly\\' which likely arrived in the Rockall Trough\\nregion around 1993-1996 (Belkin, 2004).\\n7.5 Conclusions\\nThe Recent Benthic Foraminifera (RBF) training set and transfer functions of Sejrup\\net al., (2004) can be modified by adding modern Loch Sunart benthic foraminifera\\nassemblages from samples which adhere to the \\'rules\\' outline in Sejrup et al., 2004:\\n287\\nChapter 7 Quantitative palaeoenvironmental reconstructions\\nFigure 7.13 (A) Reconstructed summer bottom water salinity (Ss; black line) using the 3\\ncomponent WA-PLS transfer function model (Ss1) shown in figure 7.4 and created using\\nthe C2 programme (Juggins, 2003) and measured stable carbon isotopic compositions\\n(51 black line) of Cibicides lobatulus taken from the same sample depths as the benthic\\nforaminiferal assemblages used in the reconstruction.(B) As with A but with the 513C axis\\ninverted.

The addition of 3 Loch Sunart\\nsamples (22, 80 and 198) from the main and outer basin extended the upper limit of\\nthe summer (July-August-September) BWT environmental gradient from 11.99 °C to\\n12.51 °C, and increased the mean summer BWT from 5.57 °C to 5.62 °C. Though the\\naddition of the Loch Sunart samples did not extend the lower limit of the summer\\nBWS environmental gradient (already at 33.58), mean summer BWS did decrease\\nfrom 34.95 to 34.94.\\nThe computer program C2 (Juggins, 2003a, b) was used to create weighted-averaging\\npartial least squares (WA-PLS) transfer function models for summer BWT (Ts3) and\\nBWS (Ssl), using the RBF plus the 3 Loch Sunart samples; n = 253 and validated\\nusing the \\'leave-one-out\\' (or jack-knife) method. For both the Ts and Ss transfer\\nfunction models, the 3 component WA-PLS model yielded the lowest (and therefore\\nbest) maximum biasjack and lowest root mean square error of prediction (RMSEPjack).\\nThe Ts3 model yielded a max biasjack of 1.09 °C and a RMSEPjackof 1.03 °C; these are\\nimprovements on the max biasjack of 1.32 °C and RMSEPjack of 1.06 °C reported in\\nSejrup et al., (2004), and may arise from the extension of the environmental gradient.\\nThe Ssl gave a higher max biasjack than the 2 component WA-PLS Ss of Sejrup et al.,\\n(2004) with max biasjack values of 0.28 and 0.24 respectively. RMSEPjack values were\\nequal at 0.17. However, a criterion of the transfer function approach to quantitative\\npalaeoenvironmental reconstruction is that the likely range of variables experienced\\nby the fossil data set should be covered by the environmental gradient of the training\\nset, thus since there are few data at the lower end of the summer salinity gradient of\\nthe Ss model (figure 7.2), the model Ssl was preferred.\\nThe application of Ts3 to the fossil benthic foraminiferal assemblages of core SC023\\n(obtained from the main basin of Loch Sunart) reconstructed a summer (July-August-\\nSeptember) temperature series that is in good agreement with the observed summer\\nmarine temperatures of NW Scottish coastal waters between AD 1986 - 2000. The\\nMillport sea surface temperature series displayed inter-annual temperatures ranging\\nbetween 12.4 - 14.8 °C whilst the reconstructed summer bottom water temperature\\n(RBWT) yielded a temperature range of 9.0 - 10.1 °C; the differences in the\\n289\\nChapter 7 Quantitative palaeoenvironmental reconstructions\\ntemperature range is likely due to a \\'dampened\\' seasonal heating cycle signal in the\\ndeep water (120 m) of the core site (e.g. Ellett, 1979). Given the strong relationship\\nbetween reconstructed NW Scottish marine temperatures, air temperatures and the\\nNAO (chapter 3) along with the reported oceanic response to climate forcing (e.g.\\nHolliday, 2003), Loch Sunart palaeoproxies derived from benthic foraminifera are\\nlikely to reflect the climate of the North Eastern Atlantic region. The RBWS and C.\\n18lobatulus 8 O from core SC023 appear, at times, to be in anti-phase with each other,\\ndespite RBWS generally following NW Scottish coastal marine temperatures. The\\nmechanism for this anti-phasing is likely to be intricate, given the complexity of\\nregional coastal hydrography (e.g. Hill et al., 1997; Holliday, 2003) and fjordic basin\\nwater exchange (Gillibrand et al., 2005), however a stratification process is outlined\\nas a possible cause, though the anti-phasing could also reflect the faunal depth\\nhabitats. Irrespective of this, the C. lobatulus 8lsO changes are unlikely to reflect\\nsolely BWS variations since the 0.33 %c 8I80 shift between 1993-1995 would require\\na change in salinity of ~ 1.8 (Austin & Inall, 2002), which is highly unlikely to occur\\nin Loch Sunart, even during extremes of NAO climatic forcing (Gillibrand et al.,\\n(2005). The same shift of 0.33 %c equates to a temperature change of around 1.5 °C\\n(Bemis et al., 1998) and this is similar to the inter-annual temperature variations seen\\nin the Millport temperature series. Therefore, a direct C. lobatulus 6I80: salinity\\nrelationship is likely to be overprinted by a stronger inter-annual temperature effect\\nbut is possible that benthic 5180 are influenced by underlying inter-annual salinity\\nvariations caused by climatically forced regional circulation changes.\\nReconstructed summer BWS (RBWS) ranges from 33.99 to 34.22. Observed BWS at\\nthe core site is typically ~ 33.6, suggesting the transfer function model Sslconsistently\\nover-estimates BWS at the Loch Sunart core site, and this may be due to the under-\\nrepresentation of benthic foraminiferal assemblages with similar BWS in the RBL.\\nThe inter-annual salinity variations in the RBWS cannot be compared to an observed\\nBWS series, however, the 813C from the epifaunal species C. lobatulus suggests\\n1 \"3\\nisotopically depleted 8 C typically occurs with fresher salinities; a relationship also\\nreported by Polyak et al., (2003). Additionally, the trend towards decreasing salinity\\ntowards the core top is consistent with reports of freshening in the N Atlantic region\\nand could reflect the influence of the prolonged positive NAO phase (e.g. Blindheim\\net al., 2000).\\n290\\nChapter 8 Late Holocene palaeoenviroranental record\\nChapter 8 - Late Holocene Palaeoenvironmental History of Loch\\nSunart\\n8.1 Introduction\\nRecent studies have shown that Holocene climate is not as stable as once thought\\n(chapter 1) with 4 marked climatic phases occurring within the past 2000 years; the\\nRoman Warm Period (RWP), the Dark Ages Cold Period (DACP), the Medieval\\nWarm Period (MWP) and the Little Ice Age (LIA). The latter climatic event, the LIA,\\nis particularly important since it: coincides with the Maunder Minimum of solar\\nactivity (Reid, 1997; Luterbacher et al., 2001; Shindell et al., 2001); occurs during a\\nphase of sluggish current activity in the NE Atlantic (Bianchi & McCave, 1999b); and\\nis thought to be linked to the 1-2 kyr climate cycles which pervade late Quaternary\\npalaoerecords (Bond et al., 1999). Additionally, the LIA provides a good test of\\npalaeo-data, since it has a small but defined signal relative to the deglaciation signal\\n(Jennings et al., 2001) and is covered relatively well by instrumental data.\\nDespite this, marine palaeoclimate records from the Holocene often stop short of the\\nlast 2000 years (e.g. Austin & Kroon, 2001; Birks and Koc, 2002; Husum & Hald,\\n2004a), probably due to a lack of resolution or the loss of core tope material in these\\ndeep sea or shelf sedimentary records (pers comm., Dr. W. Austin, 2005). Since\\nfjords (or sea lochs) act as natural sediment traps, it is possible to obtain high\\nresolution palaeoclimatic archives for the last 11000 years from these marginal\\nenvironments (chapter 1). Additionally, the strong influence of the surrounding\\ncatchment upon fjordic hydrography and sedimentology provides the potential to\\nstudy interlinking terrestrial and marine environmental change in the sediment core\\n(chapter 1).\\nThe westerly location of Loch Sunart on the European N Atlantic seaboard (figure\\n2.7) results in a strong relationship with North Atlantic driven weather systems and\\nmarine climate (chapter 3; Hurrell, 1995), demonstrating the potential sensitivity of\\nthis region to millennial and centennial scale climate and oceanic variability (e.g.\\nOliver et al., 1997; Baker et al., 1999; Bianchi & McCave, 1999b; Cooper et al.,\\n2000; Kroon et al., 2000; Proctor et al., 2000; Austin & Kroon, 2001; O\\'Sullivan et\\n291\\nChapter 8 Late Holocene palaeoenvironmental record\\nal., 2002; Proctor et al., 2002; Dawson et al., 2004; Hall et al., 2004; Lozano et al.,\\n2004; Gillibrand et al., 2005).\\n8.1.1 Aims and objectives\\nThough palaeoclimatic and palaeoenvironmental studies have been carried out in\\nmany Scandinavian fjordic environments, particularly during the past decade (e.g.\\nAlve, 1995; Kristensen et al., 1995; Kelly et al., 1999; Nordberg et al., 2000;\\nMikalsen et al., 2001; Nordberg et al., 2001; Sejrup et al., 2001; Gustafsson &\\nNordberg, 2002; Howe et al., 2002; Plassen & Vorren, 2002; Hald et al., 2003;\\nFilipsson & Nordberg, 2004; Husum & Hald, 2004a; Kristensen et al., 2004; Lysa et\\nal., 2004; Smittenberg et al., 2005), few studies have addressed palaeoenvironmental\\nchange in Scottish sea lochs (Dix & Duck, 2000; Howe et al., 2002; Murray et al.,\\n2003) and none in Loch Sunart. Therefore, presented here is the first multi-proxy late\\nHolocene palaeoenvironmental record from Loch Sunart.\\nIn order to interpret palaeoenvironmental data it is essential to understand the modern\\nprocesses occurring in the environment, i.e. employ the principles of\\nuniformitarianism, where the present is the key to the past. Palaeoenvironmental work\\nin the fjords of NW Scotland have focused upon depositional regimes across the Late\\nGlacial - Interglacial Transition (Dix & Duck, 2000; Howe et al., 2002) or recent (last\\n200 years) environmental change in the near-anoxic Loch Etive (Murray et al., 2003)\\nwhich is not comparable to the well ventilated Loch Sunart (chapter 1). Modem\\nstudies in Loch Sunart or other sea lochs have primarily been concerned with\\ncirculation processes (Elliott et al., 1992; Gillibrand et al., 1995; Gillibrand et al.,\\n2005) or fishery studies (Treasurer, 2001; McKenzie et al., 2004). Previous chapters,\\ntherefore, have explored elements of the modern environment of Loch Sunart which\\nhave implications for the interpretation of palaeorecords. For instance; exploring the\\nimpact of N Atlantic climate systems on observed temperature series from Loch\\nSunart via comparison with long instrumental records (chapter 3) and determining the\\nsensitivity of Loch Sunart circulation to climatic forcing (Gillibrand et al., 2005);\\ninvestigating marine radiocarbon reservoir ages in NW Scottish fjords to improve the\\ngeochronology of cores obtained from these environments (chapter 4); determining\\n292\\nChapter 8 Late Holocene palaeoenvironmental record\\nthe modern distribution of benthic foraminifera in Loch Sunart (chapter 5) and\\ncalibrating recent proxies to instrumental records (chapter 6 & 7).\\nThe main aim of this chapter is to use the environmental and ecological data collated\\nin the previous chapters to aid the interpretation of a 3 m gravity core GC023 obtained\\nfrom the main basin of Loch Sunart via a multi-proxy approach. The suitability of\\nutilising sedimentary archives from Scottish sea lochs will be discussed and the\\npalaeoenvironmental record from core GC023 will be placed into a broader context of\\nNE Atlantic palaeoclimate via comparison to other records.\\n8.2 Methods\\nGravity core GC023 (core length 2.89 m) was recovered from the main basin of Loch\\nSunart; the Dun Ghallain Deep (56.6670° N,-5.8388 °W\\' figure 2.9), from a water\\ndepth of 120 m. An accompanying Sholkovitch core, SC023 (0.74m length) was also\\nrecovered (56.6659 °N, -5.8404 °W; approximate distance from GC023 = 138 m) to\\ncapture the sediment-water interface, since the core top can often be lost during\\ngravity coring (chapter 2). The lithology of the core was noted (figure 8.1) and\\nmarine molluscan material was removed for radiocarbon dating. Grain size analyses\\nwere carried out at a 1 cm resolution for raw sediments samples and at a 10 cm\\nincrements for digested samples (i.e. with organic and calcium carbonate content\\nremoved; see methods chapter). High resolution (at 1cm increments) geochemical\\ntrace element data was obtained via an XRF core scanner and low resolution\\ngeochemical data (approximately every 30 cm) was obtained using XRD methods\\n(chapter 2). Stable oxygen and carbon isotopic compositions were measured on\\napproximately 20 specimens of the benthic foraminifera Cibicides lobatulus (via\\nstable isotope mass spectrometry) at a 1 cm sampling resolution.\\nThe geochronology for cores GC023 and SC023 was constructed using a combination\\nof radiocarbon dating and bulk sediment geochemical methods using lead and caesium\\n(data from Dr. T. Shimmeild, SAMS; see Appleby & Oldfield, 1992; Appleby, 1997\\nfor methodology). The conventional radiocarbon dates for the geochronology of\\nGC023 and SC023 were calibrated using OxCal3 (Ramsey, 1995, 2001), which uses\\n293\\nChapter 8 Late Holocene palaeoenvironmental record\\nthe marine radiocarbon curve (\\'marine98\\') of Stuiver et al., (1998), after a regional\\nAR correction of -27 ±11 was applied (see section chapter 4).\\n8.3 Results\\nThe majority of data are presented diagrammatically; raw data can be found in the\\nappendices.\\nSedimentology\\n8.3.1 GC023 core log\\nGravity core GC023 is comprised of clayey silt from the base (290.5 cm) to\\napproximately 70cm, and silt from 70 cm to the top of the core (figure 8.1). The core\\nappears to be moderately bioturbated throughout and contains a significant number of\\nbivalve shells, some of which were used for radiocarbon dating (figure 8.1).\\nAdditionally a number of plant fragments were also logged within the core,\\ndemonstrating the significance of inputs (particularly organic matter) from the\\nsurrounding catchment.\\nSholkovitch core SC023 consists of silt from 70 cm to the core top, thus agreeing well\\nwith the sedimentology of core GC023. Additionally, the magnetic susceptibility\\n(MS) and grain size > 63 pm of core SC023 agrees fairly well with GC023, pointing\\nto little, if any, loss of the GC023 core top (figure 8.1).\\n8.3.2 Geochronology for core GC023\\n8.3.2.1 Radiocarbon chronology\\nThe measured radiocarbon results and the calibrated radiocarbon ages (for AR = 0 and\\nAR = -27 ±11) can be seen in table 8.1. Shell material from the base of core GC023\\ngives a calibrated age of 2055 ± 55 years BP. The uppermost shell dates at 27 and 30\\ncm core depth show \\'modern\\' calibrated ages, (i.e. post-bomb) suggesting material\\nabove this depth has accumulated within the last -50 years (after AD 1950). The\\ncalibration peak of sample AA-51569 occurs before AD 1950 at around AD 1910\\n(figure 8.2) indicating a small probability that the date is pre-1950.

This section of core SC023 has been removed from any interpretation\\nof the chronology. The peak in 137Cs (figure 8.5) at ~ 22 cm reflects the 1975\\nSellafield discharge arriving in Loch Sunart in 1976 (Begg, 1992) and provides a\\n^A/- AA\"7\\nvaluable age-control point. The shift towards depleted Pb/ Pb ratios (figure 8.5)\\naround 70 cm depth shows the commencement of leaded fuel use in the 1920\\'s (pers.\\ncomm., Prof. G. Shimmield, 2004). The historical occurrence of the latter two proxies\\nprovide two \\'tie-points\\' for constructing the geochronology.\\nChronologies were derived for 210Pb (applying the Constant Initial Concentration\\nmodel, Appleby & Oldfield, 1983) and 137Cs using dry bulk densities and cumulative\\nAA/ O/Y7\\nmass converted to years. When plotted against the Pb/ Pb data, it is clear that the\\n137 206 207Cs chronology provides the best age model, with the decrease in Pb/ Pb\\noccurring at around AD 1920 (fig 8.6), the reported time period for which\\nanthropogenic Pb from internal combustion engines first significantly impacted the\\nUK (Farmer et al., 1997). The difference in chronologies is most likely due to the\\n710 137\\nperturbation of xs Pb by the burrows, and therefore the Cs chronology is\\npreferred. Alternatively, the two chronologies can be combined and averaged (pers.\\ncomm., Prof. G. Shimmield, 2004), and this is the age model which will be used in this\\nstudy.

Grain size begins to decrease from around 26.5 cm to reach a grain size of\\n5.6 ± 0.64 % for the top 10 cm of core GC023. Data presented in appendix 11.\\n8.3.3.2 Treated sediment grain size > 63 fim\\nGrain size > 63 pm for the digested and de-calcified (from hereon referred to as\\n\\'treated\\') sediment samples shows similar trends to the raw grain size record, that the\\ngrain size is finer below 115 cm and coarser above, with the peak grain size occurring\\naround 36 cm (figure 8.2). However, treated sediment samples show coarser grain\\nsizes than the raw samples (typically greater than 6 vol-% in the lower section and >\\n10 vol-% in the upper section of the core).\\nThe treated samples appear to uncover more variability in grain size > 63 pm than the\\nraw sediment samples, e.g. the lower section has two peaks where grain size % nearly\\ndoubles, a feature not seen in the raw sample series (figure 8.2). This suggests that the\\ngrain size of the raw sediment sample series may at times be dominated by the finer\\nparticles of organic material or carbonate present in the sediment, rather than\\nminerogenic sediment.\\n8.3.4 Magnetic Susceptibility\\nLow frequency and high frequency magnetic susceptibility (%) readings for core\\nGC023 show good agreement (appendix 12), though at times lower values in the high\\nMS indicate the presence of fine-grained magnetic particles (Dearing, 1998).\\nMagnetic susceptibility varies around a mean of 7.56 ± 0.97 SI units from the base of\\nthe core up to 135 cm, though slightly higher % (>9) is common between the base and\\n279 cm. At 135 cm, % gradually begins to increase, peaking at 48.9 SI units at 38 cm\\n302\\nChapter 8 Late Holocene palaeoenvironmental record\\ncore depth. This gradual increase is punctuated by a small % peak of 28.5 SI units at\\n80 cm core depth. After -34 cm, % begins to decrease to a value of 35.2 SI units at the\\ncore top (figure 8.7).\\nA strong %: grain size relationship exists for core GC023 (r = 0.86, p = 0.0) with\\nhigher % values typically occurring with coarser grain sizes (figure 8.8).\\n8.3.5 Water content and dry bulk density\\nThe dry bulk density and water content of GC023 sediments were primarily\\ndetermined for the purpose of calculating mass specific magnetic susceptibility since\\nwater is diamagnetic (Dearing, 1998).\\nThe sediments of core GC023 typically have high water contents, with all samples\\nretaining > 40% water (figure 8.7; appendix 13). Water content is greater at the top of\\nthe core (~ 58 %) than at the bottom of the core (41 %) probably due to the dewatering\\nof the sediment through compression from the overlying sediments.\\nThere is a gradual decrease in the dry bulk density of the sediments from - 0.94 g/cm\\nat the base of the core to 0.57 g/cm3 at the core top. Again this is likely due to\\ncompression effects of overlying sediments.\\n8.3.6 Bulk sediment geochemical data\\n8.3.6.1 Total carbon content (Ctotai)\\nThe % total carbon (Ctotai) remains fairly stable at 3.3 ± 0.05 % from the base of the\\ncore to 125 cm. Apart from the isolated peak of 4.16 % Ctotai at 110 cm, the % Ctotai\\nincreases (with some variability) towards the top of the core, reaching a maximum\\nCtotai (excluding the peak) of 4% (figure 8.7) at 0 cm.

TOC decreases slightly at 165 cm, from\\nwhere it increases (with great variability) to 1.93 % at 60 cm, and rapidly drops to 0.7\\n% TOC at 55 cm. TOC then increases towards the core top demonstrating relatively\\nlarge shifts (-0.8%) in TOC until the maximum TOC of 2.6% at 1 cm.\\n8.3.6.3 C/N ratio\\nGC023 C/N ratios vary around a mean of 9.49 ± 0.55 and there appear to be 3 main\\nC/N events in the core (figure 8.7; appendix 14). A high ratio (> 10) period occurs\\nbetween 255 - 220 cm, followed by C/N ratios (~ 9.2) indicating a more marine\\ninfluence at the core site between 205 cm and 99 cm. The top 95 cm of the core sees\\nC/N ratios fluctuating between 9.74 and the maximum C/N ratio of 10.73, before the\\nC/N ratio gradually decreases to ratio of around 9.86 at the core top. A similar range\\nof C/N ratios is seen in a nearby core from Loch Sunart\\'s main basin (pers. comm.,\\nGreg Anton, 2005). Sample repeats taken at 95 cm show 3 very different C/N ratios\\nof 7.93, 9.47 and 10.45; this is likely to demonstrate the heterogeneous nature of\\nsediment within the core rather than analytical error.\\n8.3.6.4 High resolution XRF trace element data.\\nTrace element geochemistry from core GC023 shows high frequency variability for all\\nelements (figure 8.9). However, the low frequency trends and shifts seen in the data\\nare thought to be due to the dewatering of these high water content sediments at the\\ncore breaks (i.e. where the core has been split into 3 lengths; pers. comm. Dr. W.\\nAustin, 2005), with maximum counts typically occurring towards the breaks (figure\\n8.4). Since the dewatering effects cannot be separated from natural variability, these\\ngeochemical data unfortunately cannot be interpreted with confidence.\\nIt is also difficult to separate environmental variability from noise when counts per\\nsecond measurements are low counts, i.e. < 50 counts per second (pers. comm. Dr. W.\\nAustin, 2005), as is the case for (Cu), strontium (Sr), vanadium (V), chromium (Cr),\\n305\\nFigure8.9HighresolutionXRFochemicaldatafroLSunartcGC023.Uni sgrsiz>63fiandmagn ics sceptibility(x)ownthax .

Since species diversity\\ndetermined using the Shannon-Weaver and Fisher-a indices typically show linear\\nrelationships with each other and with the equitability of the assemblage (chapter 5),\\nonly the Shannon-Weaver index has been shown in figure 8.11 for diagrammatical\\nreasons. Fisher-a are indicated in the text for comparison to other studies (e.g.\\nMurray, 1973, 1991). Diversities range from 2.06 to 3.196 for the Shannon-Weaver\\nindex and from 6.7 to 18.4 for the Fisher-a index. As with the modern surface\\nsamples (chapter 5), richer species diversity and higher equitability typically occur in\\nsamples with a higher benthic foraminiferal abundance per gram (chapter 5), and the\\nShannon-Weaver index and benthic foraminiferal abundance are well correlated (r =\\n0.707, p = 0.002).\\nFrom the base of the core, benthic foraminiferal abundance decreases from 2741\\nspecimens.g\"1 to 778 specimens.g\"1 at 140.5 cm, with a large increase in abundance\\n(3887 specimens.g\"1) occuring at 160.5 cm. After this, abundance steadily increases\\nfrom 1363 specimens.g\"1 at 120.5 cm to 1601 specimens.g~\\' at 80.5 cm and shows a\\nlarge increase in abundance from 60.5 cm to the maximum benthic foraminiferal\\nabundance of 5693 specimens.g\"1 at 20.5 cm. Abundance increases slightly towards\\nthe core top. Benthic foraminiferal abundances have been calculated via specimens.g\"\\n1 rather than volume due to potential problems with the compaction of sediment in the\\ncore (pers comm., Dr. Austin, 2005). Though species diversity also shows a\\npronounced peak (Shannon-Weaver = 3.06, Fisher-a = 13.5) at 160.5 cm, the\\ndiversity curve differs from the abundance curve in that species diversity is more\\npronounced in the basal assemblage and the core top assemblages (0-60 cm). The\\nbasal assemblage has a Shannon-Weaver diversity of 2.68 (Fisher-a = 10.9),\\ndecreasing to 2.06 (Fisher-a = 6.09) at 280.5 cm, increasing to 3.2 at the core top\\n(Fisher-a = 17.6).\\n309\\n90\\n100 110 120 130 140 150 160 170 180 190 200 210 220 230 240 250 260 270 280 290-I\\n>\\\\\\n&\\n0510IS257\\no\\\\o\\n<,*-\\n**/Z\\n✓ o\\\\o°\\n2.0530.10246(\\n\\\\\\nI—I—Il_\\n<r00<??<$>\\' $y^\\no\\\\oifo\\\\oX „\\\\.X^V£\\n0204\\n200\\n—Ft-II— 020\\n►\\no\\\\o°\\nI1\\n11111111\\n\\\\\\nU>\\n►—*\\no\\nFigure8.11Benthicforaminiferalt xw thperc ntab ndances>2%lo gb t icfor minif ralabundance(BF)dbe iforami f ralsp esdiv ity (ShannonH),dt ereconstructedbottomwa ertemperature(RBWT)reconstr ct dbo tomw t rs li ity(RBWS;u inghm fiedweigh d-av rage partialle stsquarestran f rfunctionmod lou lin dichapte7)L chSu artGC023.Al osh wnt t b exygenc ocomp i ionsfr mt benthicspeciesCibicidlobatulu(wh hty i allyh vsso iatederrorof0.03% )ndLOWESSmoot ersw hp nf.1.Sedim tgr insiz ,C/Nra iosnd phosphorousconcentration(P2O5%)areshownf c mpa is .\\nChapter 8 Late Holocene palaeoenvironmental record\\n8.3.7.2 Benthic foraminiferal assemblages\\nSediment samples from core GC023 are primarily dominated by Bulimina marginata\\nwith samples commonly having abundances between 20-40 %. Secondary species\\nwith abundances between 10 - 20 % include Spiroplectaminna wrightii, Ammonia\\nbeccarii, Cibicides lobatulus and Nonionella turgida.\\nThe benthic foraminiferal basal assemblage (at 290.5 cm) is similar to the assemblage\\nat 160.5 cm, with reduced A. beccarii, B. marginata and S. wrightii abundance, and\\nincreased Bolivina species, Epistominella vitrea and S. fusiformis abundance.\\nHowever, a noticeable difference in the two assemblages is that the basal assemblage\\nalso displays a significant increase in C. lobatulus and Elphidium exavatum\\nabundances (figure 8.11).\\nElphidium excavatum appears to decreases slightly towards the top of the core whilst\\nGavelinopsis praegeri and C. lobatulus increases (figure 8.11). E. scabra shows a\\ndefinite response to the grain size peak at around 35.5 cm, decreasing from ~ 6% to\\n0%. Ammoscalaria runiana appears at 160.5 cm, increasing to ~ 6% abundance\\nbefore decreasing again towards the top of the core. Adercotryma glomeratum is\\nlargely absent from the core, only appearing at 40.5 cm and then increasing towards\\nthe top of the core.\\nThe most significant changes in the benthic foraminiferal assemblages are the peaks\\nand troughs in taxon abundances at 160.5 cm (figure 8.11) with notable decreases of\\nA. beccarii, B. marginata and S. wrightii abundance. The most significant increases in\\nthe assemblages are the peaks in abundance of Bolivina pseudopunctata,\\nEpsitominella vitrea, and S. fusiformis at 160.5 cm. These peaks coincide with a\\ntrough in B. marginata (12.7 %), and though this is likely to be an artefact of the\\nincreasing proportions of other species, as shown by the increase in the Shannon-\\nWeaver diversity index, B. marginata abundance was already decreasing from 240.5\\ncm. Additionally, the benthic foraminiferal abundance peaks at this point. An\\ninteresting point to note is that the N. turgida abundance at 180.5 cm precedes the taxa\\nabundance changes at 160.5 cm.\\n311\\nChapter 8 Late Holocene palaeoenvironmental record\\n8.3.8 GC023 stable isotopic compositions\\n8.3.8.1 GC023 S180\\n5lsO values from core GC023 range from 0.61 %c to 1.23 %c (appendix 16). The\\nrecord shows high frequency oscillations regularly reaching around 0.4 %c,\\n18\\nsuperimposed on long term isotopic shifts. A LOWESS smoother through the 8 O\\ndata points to long-term shifts in the record (figure 8.11). The 8180 record (figure\\n8.12) frequently displays high frequency isotopic shifts of around 0.4 %c, which is the\\nequivalent of 2 °C (chapter 7 and Bemis et al., 1998) and has 4 distinct low frequency\\nperiods: 1) the relatively stable period from the core bottom to approximately 150 cm\\ncore depth, with S180 varying between 0.8 - 0.9 %&, 2) the discrete extreme positive\\nS180 value of 1.23 %c at 161.5 cm; 3) the brief phase of more positive values between\\n1 o\\n152 - 138 cm; 3) the shift towards more enriched 8 O from 102 cm towards the core\\ntop.\\nThe 813C record shows higher frequency change with isotopic shifts typically around\\n0.4 %c. The long-term (i.e. low frequency) trends shows less variability than the 8lsO\\nrecord, with heavier 813C at the base of the core becoming gradually lighter between\\n1\\n250 - 160 cm. At 160 cm there appears to be a shift towards heavier 8 C until ~ 64\\ncm, where the long-term 8I3C trend remains fairly stable before shifting towards\\nlighter S13C in the top 10 cm.\\n8.3.8.2 GC023 313C\\nThe 813C record for GC023 shows similar high-frequency oscillations to 8lsO,\\nhowever the amplitude change of these oscillations frequently appears to be less than\\n0.2 %c (figure 8.12). The long-term shift in the record is clearly visible and appears to\\nbe less variable than the 8,80 record. 813C values are around 1.45 %c at the base of the\\n1\\ncore and this shift towards isotopically lighter 8 C values of around 1.20 %o at 212\\ncm, where the 813C record remains relatively stable up to 164 cm (figure 8.12). From\\n164 cm to ~ 68 cm, 813C values become progressively enriched in 13C, shifting from a\\nmean of around 1.20 %c to 1.6 %c and fluctuating between 1.55 - 1.65 %c, before\\nmoving towards slightly more depleted 8I3C values in the top 10 cm of the core.\\n312\\nChapter 8 Late Holocene palaeoenvironmental record\\nGC023\\n5180,%o 813C,%o\\nFigure 8.12.

Like 813C\\n1 3\\nfrom GC023, the SC023 8 C record appears to be \\'smoother\\', with less oscillations\\nthan the 8lsO record.\\nThe lack of significant correlation (r = 0.223, p = 0.124) between the 8loO and 813C\\nmeasurements in core SC023, suggests the 8lsO and 813C from this record typically do\\nnot covary as much as in GC023, though this could be due to lower sample numbers\\nin SC023 (n = 49).\\nStable isotopic compositions of SC023 C. lobatulus and GC023 C. lobatulus from\\nsimilar core depths do not match exactly (figure 8.12) but the similarity in the C.\\nlobatulus 8lsO trends for the two cores suggests little of the core top was lost during\\n314\\nChapter 8 Late Holocene palaeoenvironmental record\\nrecovery of gravity core GC023.

This\\nlikely reflects a small-scale change in the environmental conditions at the two sites,\\nwhich are ~ 138 m apart.\\n8.4 Discussion\\n8.4.1 Problematic geochronology\\nThe stratigraphic order and similarity of 14C dates from SC023 (SUERC-681) and\\nGC023 (SUERC-677; figure 8.4) suggest these cores are reconcilable with a\\ncalculated sediment accumulation rate (SAR) of 0.068 cm.yr\"1 (for 0-58 cm core\\ndepth); similar to those derived from 14C dates in Norwegian fjords (Mikalsen et al.,\\n2001). The two modern 14C dates point to a rapid SAR of 0.6 cm.yr 1 from 30 cm to\\nthe core top; agreeing well with the anthropogenic influenced high SARs reported\\nfrom similar depositional environments (e.g. Howe et al., 2002).\\nHowever, the rapid slow-down of sedimentation between 30-49 cm (SAR ~ 0.024\\ncm.yr\"1) points to potential problems in the geochronology and when the Pb-Cs\\nchronology is plotted alongside the 14C chronology (figure 8.13), the problems of\\nreconciling the two chronological methods are obvious. The combined Pb-Cs\\nchronology suggests that the top 69 cm of sediment at the Loch Sunart core site\\nSC023 was deposited since AD 1920, giving a SAR of 0.78 cm.yr\"1. This is similar to\\nreported SARs (using Pb) from other fjordic environments, e.g. Howe et al., (2002)\\nreported a SAR of ~ 0.7cmyr_1 in Loch Etive, whilst SARs of approximately\\n0.15cmyr\"\\' and 0.68cmyr\"\\' have been reported for NW Norwegian fjords (Kristensen\\net al., 2004) and Gullmar Fjord, Sweden (Nordberg et al., 2000). The two modem\\nradiocarbon dates around 30 cm in the GC023 core agree well with the Pb-Cs\\nchronology (figure 8.13) suggesting that the geochronology for the top 30 cm of both\\nGC023 and SC023 can be assumed to be robust.\\nThe agreement between the two chronological methods breaks down at ~ 30-49 cm\\ndepth, with the radiocarbon chronology appearing to be offset by 755 ± 95 cal years.\\nOffsets of this magnitude are often seen in Danish fjords which are influenced by old\\n315\\nChapter 8 Late Holocene palaeoenvironmental record\\nCalendar age, BC / AD\\n0\\n20\\n40\\n60\\n80\\n100\\n§ 120\\no-\\n^ 140\\n<D\\n6\\n160\\n180\\n200\\n220\\n240\\n260\\n280\\n300\\n0 200\\n1\\n, I\\nPb/Cs age model\\n■ 14C age model\\n□ Reworked dates\\n— % Grain size > 63 pm\\n— C/N ratio\\n400 600 800 1000 1200 1400 1600 1800 2000\\n-2-1 0 1\\nA C/N ratio\\nB\\nA\\n% Grain size > 63 pm\\nFigure 8.13 The problems of reconciling the radiocarbon (14C) chronology of core GC023 with the\\nlead-caesium (Pb/Cs) chronology from coreSC023. The dates in the lower part of the core (black squares)\\nwere used to construct the 14C age model (black squares). The sharp increase in % grain size > 63 pm at\\n113 cm depth and the subsequent decrease in sedimentation rate points to a period ofwinnowing or\\nscouring of the sediments (A), probably by strong bottom currents. This is supported by a negative AC/N\\n(normalised to the mean) shift towards more marine C/N values. The disparity between Pb/Cs chronology\\nand the 14C dates (unfilled squares) lying within the high (>5%) grain size values suggests that these 14C\\ndates are likely to be reworked, thus they are omitted from the 14C age model. The AC/N ratio suggests\\nincreased terrigeneous inputs at this time (B). The modern dates agrees well with the Pb/Cs data and\\nmay have calcified during a time of negligible winnowing and decreased input from the catchment.\\n316\\nChapter 8 Late Holocene palaeoenvironmental record\\ncarbon from the limestone bedrock geology (chapter 2; Heier-Nielsen et al., 1995).\\nThe predominantly igneous/metamorphic geology of Loch Sunart will not contribute a\\n\\'hard water\\' effect to Loch Sunart 14C measurement, though inwash of \\'old carbon\\' in\\nthe form of stable organic residues from eroding peat and mor humus in the catchment\\n(Appleby et al., 1985) could significantly influence the 14C/12C ratio, and GC023 C/N\\nratios point to increased input from the surrounding catchment (figure 8.13).\\nPresently, the main basin water of Loch Sunart is frequently exchanged with coastal\\nwaters (Gillibrand et al., 1995) and any \\'old carbon\\' signal is likely to be greatly\\ndiluted by the 14C/12C signal of the coastal waters. GC023 C. lobatulus 513C (a proxy\\n1 -5\\nfor bottom water salinity; BWS) from 80 cm upwards is fairly enriched in C,\\nsuggesting coastal waters are a significant influence in main basin water during this\\nperiod. Radiocarbon curves over the past 2 millenia exhibit a 14C plateau (section\\n2.7.9). The plateau in the marine radiocarbon curve is much \\'smoother\\' than the\\natmospheric curve (Stuiver et al., 1998) and though 14C dates from fjordic\\nenvironments are likely to display a 14C age influenced by atmospheric 14C, it is\\nunlikely that the I4C plateau explains the observed 14C: Pb-Cs disparity.\\nThe large gap between the calibrated 14C date of 725 ± 60 AD at 111.5 cm (SUERC-\\n679) and the Pb-Cs date of AD 1920 at ~ 70 cm points to a SAR of 0.034 cmyr\"1;\\nfairly low for a fjordic environment in comparison to other studies. Grain size and\\nmagnetic susceptibility data both point to a dynamic change in either sedimentation or\\nhydrography taking place at ~ 102 cm depth in GC023, the section of the age model\\nwhich displays a SAR decrease (fig. 8.13). The core site is landward of a sill and the\\nsteep-sided bathymetry of the Dun Ghallain Deep (figure 2.9) is likely to funnel and\\naccelerate tidal currents (which can propagate to the floor of Loch Sunart; Gillibrand\\net al., 1996) and currents associated with deep water renewal events, over the core\\nsite. Therefore, the sharp increase in grain size and the slow SAR likely represents\\nwinnowing of the sediment as bottom water current strength increases (e.g. Bianchi &\\nMcCave, 1999a; Mikalsen et al., 2001). The hypothesis of sediment winnowing or\\nremoval in deep basins of Loch Sunart; basins which are usually thought to hold thick\\nsediment packages due to sediment focussing; is supported by the seismic profile\\nshown in figure 8.14, which demonstrates that the Holocene sediment package at ~\\n317\\nChapter 8 Late Holocene palaeoenvironmental record\\nFigure 8.14 Seismic profile of the deep basin in Loch Sunart, near Laga, maximum water depth approximately\\n111m. The inset shows the location of the seismic profile near the GC023 core site in the Dun Ghallain Deep.\\nSeismic characteristics suggest the black line is possibly bedrock, the dark grey line is the upper boundary of\\nthe Late-Glacial/Younger Dryas sediment package and the light grey line represents the modern day sediment\\nsurface, i.e. the surface of the Holocene sediment package. The sediment package at on the shelf (B) is clearly\\nthicker Ihan the sediment package in the deep at A, which one may expect to be thicker due to sediment\\nfocussing, supporting the hypothesis ofwinnowing of sediments in Loch Sunart\\'s deepest basin. Data\\nobtained from Dr. C. R. Bates.\\n318\\nChapter 8 Late Holocene palaeoenvironmental record\\n111m water depth is substantially thinner than the Holocene sediment package at ~ 50\\nm water depth. These seismic data were not available at the time of coring.\\nIf the sharp increase in grain size at ~ 102 cm depth is due to winnowing, then the 14C\\ndata above this depth are likely to be from reworked shell material and therefore will\\nnot be used in the age model (figure 8.13). Molluscs used to obtain the 14C dates\\nbelow 102 cm (SUERC-679, SUERC-680 and CAMS-82821) were obtained from\\nclayey-silt sediment and are likely in situ; thus the chronology between -300 cm and\\n-102 cm is assumed to be reliable (figure 8.13).\\nHowever, the grain size record of GC023 is unlikely to be caused solely by\\nwinnowing since the geochemical chronology points to rapid sedimentation from\\napproximately AD 1920 onwards (i.e. from 69cm to the core top); a period which\\ndisplays the coarsest grain size composition. An increase in magnetic susceptibility\\nfrom - 100 cm core depth and a shift from typical marine C/N ratios to high ratios\\npoint to an increased input from the catchment coinciding with this phase of increased\\nsediment accumulation. The steady shift back towards more \\'marine\\' C/N ratio from\\naround 35 cm core depth coincides with the shift towards finer grain sizes and\\ndecreased magnetic susceptibility (fig 8.13), suggesting either a change in catchment\\nerosion or a decrease in bottom current influence i.e. reduced winnowing. A switch\\nback to sedimentation without a winnowing influence would explain the good\\nagreement of the two modern dates (SUERC-675 and AA-51569) with the Pb-Cs\\nchronology, since the bivalves used for dating would have been in situ within the\\nsediment (figure 8.13). Interestingly, Appleby et al., (1985) suggest peak\\nsedimentation rates in a core recovered from Loch Frisa (a freshwater loch on Mull)\\noccur in the early 19th century, with a small decline around AD 1950.\\n8.4.1.1 Age models\\nThe apparent winnowing of sediment at core site GC023 results in the top and bottom\\nsection of the core being irreconcilable. A 200-year difference between 14C and Pb-Cs\\ncan also be seen in core HM122-10BC from Ranafjorden (Kristensen et al., 2004).\\nKristensen et al., (2004) exclude this date from the age-model and construct a\\ngeochronology from the basal 14C date and the Pb-Cs age model. However, the\\n319\\nChapter 8 Late Holocene palaeoenvironmental record\\ndifferences in geochronology with depth for core GC023, along with large changes in\\nsedimentology and geophysical evidence of thin sediment packages in deep basins,\\ndemonstrate that sediment removal and winnowing processes occur in the deep basins\\nof Loch Sunart, and most probably, other fjordic environments. It has also highlighted\\nthe potential problems of obtaining few age control points for constructing\\ngeochronologies, as SARs can vary over time, and although the number of 14C dates\\nfrom GC023 has complicated the interpretation of sedimentation in these fjords, it has\\nalso pointed to potential hiatuses.\\nThough erroneous 14C dates in stratigraphy can occur with bioturbation, to \\'force\\' an\\nage model from the basal 14C of GC023 to the beginning of the Pb-Cs data (as\\nKristensen et al., 2004 did), particularly given independent data pointing to sediment\\nremoval from the site, would result in an extremely unrealistic core geochronology.\\nThus two age models are used in this study. The first (Pb-Cs age model) is\\nconstructed from the Pb-Cs data (table 8.2) and is applied to the top 69 cm of core\\nGC023. The Pb-Cs age model has an average SAR of 0.78 cm.yr\"1, and can be\\ncalculated using the 3rd order polynomial equation (R2 = 1) which reproduces the\\nmeasured Pb-Cs chronology with maximum errors of ± 0.24 years\\ny = -0.0000102350300784856 * x3 + 0.0031776057627003 *x 2\\n+ 1.12265137883038 * x - 51.078992155376 (Eq. 8.2)\\nThe second age model (14C age model) differs from the age model given by equation\\n8.1, in that it is constructed using the calibrated (AR corrected) 14C dates of SUERC-\\n679, SUERC-680 and CAMS-82821, i.e. it excludes the possibly reworked dates from\\nSUERC-677 and AA-51570. The age model is calculated from the 3ld order\\npolynomial equation (where R =1);\\ny = 0.026446543157518 * x2 - 5.84201379909619 * x + 1597.59450242915 (Eg. 8.3)\\nThis 14C age model is applied to GC023 core depths below 105 cm, yeilding an\\naverage SAR of 0.2045 cm.yr\"1.\\n320\\nChapter 8 Late Holocene palaeoenvironmental record\\nThe high SARs calculated for each age model demonstrate the potential of obtaining\\nhigh resolution studies from the fjordic environments of NW Scotland, and thick\\npackages on the shelf areas in Loch Sunart (e.g. figure 8.13) are likely to yield high\\nresolution palaeorecords, possibly spanning the Holocene. The problematic\\ngeochronology of core GC023 highlights two important issues: a) the need to\\nunderstand modem processes influencing the site, i.e. current activity and sediment\\ndeposition, and b) the importance of reconnaissance geophysical surveys prior to\\ncoring. Despite the construction of the two age models, the chronology of core\\nGC023 is questionable, and therefore, changes in the palaeoenvironmental proxies\\nobtained from GC023 will be first be discussed with relation to depth.\\n8,4.2 Changes in fjordic circulation during the past 2000 years: evidence of\\nincreasing marine coastal water influence at the core site\\n8.4.2.1 Bulk sediment geochemical data\\nThe clearest sign of a change in bottom water conditions is the significant shift in\\nmanganese (MnO) concentration at ~ 185 cm (figure 8.10). This shift signifies a\\nmajor change in the redox boundary (Chester, 1990), pointing to better ventilation and\\noxygenated conditions from 185 cm to present, as seen by the frequency of present\\nday main basin water exchange (chapter 3). Vanadium (V) concentration tends to be\\nenriched in anoxic conditions (Morford & Emerson, 1999; Yarincik et al., 2000) and\\nalthough there are problems with the high resolution geochemical data, V does appear\\nto be enriched in the bottom half of the core (figure 8.9). The occurrence of the MnO\\n1 ^\\nshift and 5 C shift (though small) at around the same time (figure 8.15) may point to\\na major regime change in ocean or atmospheric climate forcing of fjord circulation\\naround this time.\\nSodium and chloride are typical seawater elements (Open University, 1995) but are\\nalso present in igneous and metamorphic rocks, with sodium oxide (NaO) constituting\\na significant component (-5%) of the rock geochemistry. However chloride (CI) is\\ntypically a trace component in these rocks (pers comm., Dr. W. Stephens, 2005), thus\\nthe increase of CI (and most probably NaO) towards the top of GC023 is likely to\\n321\\nChapter 8 Late Holocene palaeoenvironmental record\\nreflect the increasing influence of coastal saline waters rather than detrital inputs\\neroded from the local geology.\\n8.4.2.2 Stable carbon isotopes - a signal ofmarine influence at the core site?\\n1 t\\nCibicides lobatulus is thought to calcify close to the isotopic equilibrium of 8 C\\ndissolved inorganic carbon (813CDic) in seawater (chapter 6; Mackensen et al., 1993),\\nthus C. lobatulus S13C from GC023 should reflect changes in the 513Cdic of the\\noverlying water masses at the core site. Unlike 8lsO, temperature exhibits little\\ninfluence on stable carbon isotopic composition (e.g. Grossman, 1984; Romanek et\\nal., 1992), however salinity does affect 513Cdic (e.g. Mook, 1971; Spiker, 1980;\\n1 o\\nLubinski et al., 2001; Bauch et al., 2004). Since C. lobatulus 8 C probably calcifies\\nclose to the seawater 813CDic (chapter 6), it is likely that GC023 C. lobatulus 813C\\ntraces changes in the origin of source water at the core site, i.e. the admixing of fjordic\\nS13Cdic and coastal water 813CDic, and thus likely reflects salinity variations with\\n1\\nisotopically enriched C. lobatulus 8 C representing a stronger influence of \\'marine\\'\\ncoastal waters in the main basin of Loch Sunart (e.g. Mackensen & Bickert, 1999).\\nThis hypothesis is supported by the fairly strong relationship between the C. lobatulus\\n813C and grain size > 63 pm (r = 0.630, p = 0.0, n = 285) with enriched S13C\\n(suggesting a \\'marine\\' signal) typically co-occurring with coarser sediments (figure\\n8.16). The strength of the grain size: 813C relationship thus points to enhanced current\\nactivity and basin exchange significantly influencing the grain size record of GC023,\\nparticularly within the upper core.\\n1 o\\nTherefore, the shift towards enriched 8 C at 160.5 cm suggests increased ventilation\\nand influence of marine coastal waters at the core site, a hypothesis which is\\nconsistent with other proxies such as the redox potential of the sediments,\\nconcentration of seawater elements and benthic foraminiferal response (figure 8.15),\\nand suggests a long-term change in fjordic circulation driven by either ocean\\ncirculation or atmospheric climate.\\nHigh frequency variability in the 813C record exemplifies the sensitivity of Loch\\nSunart sedimentary archives to environmental change. The large and brief light S13C\\nevents (e.g. at 245.5 cm, 224.5 cm, 146.5 cm and 71.5 cm) demonstrate that rapid\\nchanges in conditions can be captured in these high resolution records (e.g. figure\\n322\\nChapter 8 Late Holocene palaeoenvironmental record\\n0 5 10 IS 20 0 5 10 IS 7 8 9 10 11 0.81.01.21.41.61.80.4 0.60.8 1.01.2 0.0S 0.06 0.07 1.8 2.2 2.6 3.0 1 2 3 4 o 3000 6000 ° 20 40 0 20 0 20 8 9 10 11 12 33.6 34 34.2\\nFigure 8.15 Sediment and foraminiferal proxies from GC023 pointing to the increasing influence of saline\\ncoastal waters at the core site and the onset of oxygenated conditions in the main basin (shaded grey bar).\\n0.6 0.8 1 1.2 1.4 1.6 1.8 2\\n5l3C,%o\\nFigure 8.16 Exponential relationship between the 813C Cibicides lobatulus and untreated (raw) grain size\\n(weight % > 63 pm) from Loch Sunart core GC023.

These incursions are possibly periods during which fjordic basin was extremely\\nbrackish and exemplify the sensitivity of Loch Sunart sedimentary archives to\\nenvironmental change.\\n8.4.3 Response of benthic foraminiferal assemblages to environmental change\\nWhilst the sedimentological properties of core GC023 are likely to contain a mixture\\nof catchment derived and autochthonous inputs, the benthic foraminiferal assemblages\\nof core GC023 should provide a clearer picture of marine environmental conditions\\nover the last 2 millennia. Zones were not applied to the data since the low sampling\\nresolution and known problems with the core\\'s chronology are likely to lead to the\\nconstruction of inaccurate zone boundaries (pers. comm. Prof. G. Whittington, 2005).\\n8.4.3.1 Benthic foraminiferal population response to increased marine influence\\nand marine productivity\\nModern Loch Sunart surface sediment samples with a strong marine influence\\ntypically have high benthic foraminiferal abundances and richer species diversity and\\nequitability (chapter 5; Haynes, 1981). Periods of high foraminiferal abundance and\\nspecies diversity in GC023 occur where C/N ratios, 813C and reconstructed bottom\\nwater temperature and salinity point to an increased influence of cool, saline coastal\\nwaters at the core site (figure 8.15). Phosphorus (shown as P2O5 in figure 8.11)\\nconcentration in marine sediments is strongly linked to primary productivity and\\norganic carbon flux to the seabed (Delaney, 1998; Anderson et al., 2001), thus the\\nphosphorus concentration variability in GC023 probably reflects varying marine\\nproductivity over the last 2 millenia (figure 8.11) with higher productivity typically\\noccurring during periods of high coastal water influence. These inferred increased\\nproductivity periods likely explain increases in benthic foraminiferal abundance and\\nspecies diversity in GC023 (figure 8.11), since benthic foraminifera typically respond\\nto food availability (e.g. Jorissen et al., 1995; Gooday & Rathburn, 1999), particularly\\nwhen food availability is limited by seasonality (i.e. spring and autumn phytoplankton\\nblooms; Hannah & Rogerson, 1997).\\n324\\nChapter 8 Late Holocene palaeoenvironmental record\\nThe brief increase in diversity and abundance at ~ 160.5 cm coincides with the onset\\n1 ^\\nof the low frequency 8 C trend and shift to higher Mn02 concentrations, both\\nsuggesting more oxygenated conditions commenced at this level (figure 8.15), thus\\nlikely reflecting competitive colonization of this newly ventilated environment.\\nAdditionally, sea loch basins typically exhibit high oxygen consumption rates\\n(Gillibrand et al., 1996) and a shift in faunal activity is likely to significantly influence\\noxygen utilisation (Glud et al., 2003) which in turn can affect the MnO gradient in\\nsediments.\\n8.4.3.2 Indicators ofstratification conditions and a calm depositional environment\\nModern assembles with a high proportion of B. marginata typically occur at sites with\\nrelatively fine sediment, high inputs of organic matter and stratified conditions (e.g.\\nchapter 5 and Mikalsen et al., 1999; Klitgaard-Kristensen et al., 2002; Scott et al.,\\n2003; Husum & Hald, 2004a). The abundance of B. marginata in GC023 does not\\ndisplay a direct response to organic carbon content (Conradsen, 1993; Mikalsen et al.,\\n1999; Klitgaard-Kristensen et al., 2002; Murray, 2003a). However, B. marginata\\nlikely thrives on refractory carbon typically occurring in fjordic environments\\n(Klitgaard-Kristensen & Buhl-Mortensen, 1999) and the abundance decrease of B.\\nmarginata coinciding with the inferred influx of coastal water likely reflects improved\\nfood quality and increased competition, as suggested by the richer species diversity\\n(figure 8.15; section 5.4.8.1).\\nThe increase of taxa such as Bolivina species, Cassudulina species, Epistominella\\nvitrea, Fissurina lucida and S. fusiformis during higher benthic foraminiferal\\nabundance phases (figure 8.11) suggest periods of higher salinity and probably better\\noxygenated water (chapter 5; Thicde et al., 1981; Alve & Nagy, 1990; Klitgaard-\\nKristensen & Buhl-Mortensen, 1999). The hypothesis of increased coastal water\\ninfluence during these periods is also supported by the increased abundance of\\nplanktonic specimens which themselves, are not autochthonous to coastal waters and\\nare likely to have been transported into the loch (chapter 5, e.g. Murray, 1991). Thus,\\nwhilst B. marginata may prefer high salinity conditions in some environments (e.g.\\nAustin & Sejrup, 1994), high B. marginata abundance at core site GC023 is likely to\\n325\\nChapter 8 Late Holocene palaeoenvironmental record\\nreflect slightly lower salinities, less oxygenated conditions (Mikalsen et al., 1999) and\\nlow competition which typically occur with reduced inflow into the main basin.\\nN. turgida typically shows a strong affinity for fine grained organic rich sediments\\n(chapter 5) though the decreasing abundance of this delicate species in the upper 80\\ncm is probably due to enhanced bottom water current activity (figure 8.11).\\nAdditionally, N. turgida shows an affinity for warmer waters in Loch Sunart (chapter\\n6) and abundance appears to reduce during periods of low reconstructed summer\\nbottom water temperature (RBWT; figure 8.11). The increase in N. turgida\\nabundance at 180.5cm is interesting; other taxa show do not show a similar response\\n(figure 8.11), however the ~ 7% abundance increase in N. turgida most likely is a\\nresponse to increased BWT as reconstructed by the transfer function in figure 8.11.\\nThe distribution of S. fusiformis in Loch Sunart modern surface sediments\\ndemonstrates it\\'s affinity for fine-grained sediments with high organic matter content\\nwithin fjordic environments (chapter 5 and Alve & Murray, 1997; Gustafsson &\\nNordberg, 2001). However, the observed association of S. fusiformis with B.\\nmarginata, N. turgida and A. glomeratum in the modern samples is not seen here\\n(chapter 5; figure 8.11). The sudden peak in S. fusiformis abundance from values of\\naround 3% to 15.6 % at 160.5 cm occurs within the same horizon as the isolated 5180\\nspike, the onset of the low frequency S13C shift and the change in redox conditions\\n(figure 8.15). S. fusiformis is known to be a highly opportunistic species with a fast\\nresponse to rapid environmental change (Alve, 2003) and it may be that this usually\\nlow abundance species in GC023 had little competition during this regime shift.\\n8.4.3.3 Bottom current activity at core site GC023\\nBenthic foraminifera living in the main basin of Loch Sunart will experience variable\\nbottom water conditions due to the seasonal heating cycle and stratification processes\\nand deep water renewal events. This explains the high abundance of B. marginata,\\nwhich is common in seasonally variable fjordic water masses (e.g. Alve & Nagy,\\n1990; Husum & Hald, 2004b) and the fairly constant abundance of tolerant taxa such\\nas Elphidium excavatum (Murray, 1971; Mikalsen et al., 1999; Klitgaard-Kristensen\\n326\\nChapter 8 Late Holocene palaeoenvironmental record\\net al., 2002; Murray, 2003b; Murray, 2003a; Murray et al., 2003) and A. beccarii\\n(Murray, 1991).\\nModern distributions of S. wrightii and particularly C. lobatulus in Loch Sunart\\nsuggest a preference for depositional sites experiencing high current activity and well\\noxygenated, saline waters (chapter 5), hence the moderate abundance of these taxa in\\nGC023 points to episodic and/or mild current activity at the core site. Additionally, an\\nincrease in abundance of the \\'attached\\' epifaunal species, C. lobatulus and\\nGavelinopsis praegeri towards the core top, suggests an increase in current activity.\\nAt present, tidal currents may permeate to the sea bed of Loch Sunart (Gillibrand et\\nal., 1996) and the location of the core site landward of a bathymetric \\'canyon\\' likely\\nresults in this site being sensitive to changes in current activity which occur during\\ndeep water renewal events (Gillibrand et al., 1995). Therefore, increased abundances\\nof \\'high energy\\' taxa probably point to periods of frequent basin water exchange, i.e.\\nfrequent deep water renewal events (DWRE).\\n8.4.4 Quantitative bottom water reconstructions: fact or fiction?\\n8.4.4.1 Salinity\\nIn chapter 7, concerns were raised about the applicability of the transfer function\\nmodel of Sejrup et al., (2004) to reconstruct summer bottom water salinity (RBWS) in\\nthe main basin of Loch Sunart. There is a dearth of salinity data available for the\\ncoastal waters off NW Scotland (chapter 7). Therefore, at present, RBWS from\\nGC023 cannot be tested against instrumental data, but future work hopes to address\\nthis problem {pers comm., Dr. M. Inall, 2005). Though this is by no means a robust\\ncomparison, the general long-term trend of RBWS bears a similarity to the C.\\nlobatulus 513C (a possible proxy for BWS), with lower RBWS and depleted 813C\\noccurring between ~ 275 - 80 cm (figure 8.15).\\n8.4.4.2 Temperature reconstruction\\nReconstructed summer bottom water temperature (RBWT; chapter 7) appears to agree\\nwell with both inter-annual and long-term trends in instrumental marine temperature\\n327\\nChapter 8 Late Holocene palaeoenvironmental record\\nrecords from the west coast of Scotland, hence the RBWT for GC023 (figure 8.15)\\nlikely reflects summer bottom water temperatures at the core site.\\nBoth RBWT and C. lobatulus 5lsO from GC023 suggests cooling towards the top of\\nthe core (figure 8.11), however this is not consistent with recent observations of\\nincreasing air and marine temperatures in the North Atlantic (chapter 3). In modem\\nassemblages, A. beccarii typically shows a clear positive response to BWT, with\\nincreasing abundances of A. beccarii in warmer waters (chapter 6). Loch Sunart A.\\nbeccarii also has a propensity towards higher energy environments (chapter 6; Austin\\n& Sejrup, 1994; Scott et al., 2003), however a decrease in the abundance of A.\\nbeccarii towards the top of the core (< 80 cm) coincides with an increase in \\'high\\nenergy\\' taxa such as C. lobatulus and G. praegeri. Therefore it may be that the\\ndecrease in abundance of A. beccarii is reflecting a drop in BWT rather than a\\ndecrease in bottom current activity. This hypothesis is supported by the increasing\\npresence of A. glomeratum; a taxon with an affinity for cooler waters (though also a\\npropensity towards taphonomic processes; chapter 5 and Murray, 1991) and\\nCassudulina reniforme, which typically has an Arctic distribution (Austin & Sejrup,\\n1994; Husum & Hald, 2004a) and is found in modem Loch Sunart benthic\\nforaminiferal assemblages with cool BWT (appendix 8).\\n8.4.4.3 High resolution temperature signals from benthic foraminiferal isotopes\\nIsotopic measurements on modem C. lobatulus demonstrate that this species is likely\\nto calcify close to isotopic equilibrium with seawater 8lsO (e.g. chapter 7), thus C.\\n1 R\\nlobatulus 5 O from core GC023 should reflect changes in the stable isotopic\\ncomposition of the overlying bottom water masses at the core site.\\nAs discussed in chapters 6 and 7, BWS variations alone of over 2 would be required to\\ndrive the typical 5lsO signal in core GC023 (Austin & Inall, 2002); salinity changes\\nwhich are unlikely to occur, even with extreme climatic forcing (chapter 3 and\\nGillibrand et al., 2005). Therefore, the high frequency 5180 shifts in GC023 are likely\\nto be recording inter-annual temperature changes of around 2 °C (Bemis et al., 1998)\\nrather than solely inter-annual salinity variations, or perhaps a combination of both\\nBWT and BWS.\\n328\\nChapter 8 Late Holocene palaeoenvironmental record\\nThe comparison of estimated bottom water temperature (converted from GC023 C.\\nlobatulus 5i80 using the Lynch-Stieglitz et al., 1999 palaeotemperature equation and\\n§180: salinity mixing line of Austin & Inall, 2002) with the reconstructed Millport\\nseries for the period 1800 - 2000 AD agrees fairly well (figure 8.17). Inter-annual\\ndifferences between the data series are likely to reflect problems with the\\ngeochronology rather than climatic \\'lags\\' (e.g. the deviation between RBWT and\\ninstrument BWT at -1811 AD), since NW Scottish coastal water temperatures tend to\\nbe strongly coupled with regional air temperatures and both sites should therefore\\nrespond to the same climate forcing signal (chapter 3). Estimated BWT often displays\\nhigher temperatures than the reconstructed Millport series which is probably due to\\ncalibration problems identified in chapter 3 or the timing of seasonal calcification of\\nC. lobatulus (chapter 6).\\n1 8\\nIrrespective of this, the good agreement of the 5 O-derived palaoetemperature record\\nfor GC023 and the reconstructed Millport marine temperature record (figure 8.17)\\ndemonstrates that Loch Sunart sediments appear to record a coherent N Atlantic\\nclimate signal and exemplifies the potential of obtaining high resolution\\npalaeotemperature records from Loch Sunart sediment records. It also lends support\\n1 8\\nto the hypothesis that high frequency C. lobatulus 8 O shifts are recording inter-\\nannual temperature variations rather than salinity variations and the amplitudes of the\\nobserved and reconstructed BWT are similar (figure 8.17).\\nThe long term 8lsO shift of 0.096 %c between 0.5-102.5 cm (mean 8lsO = 0.956 ±\\n0.12 %c) and 102.5-290.5 cm (mean SI80 = 0.86 ± 0.10 %c) suggests either a BWT\\ndecrease of 0.46 °C or a salinity increase of - 0.53. This 5lsO shift likely reflects the\\ninterplay of temperature and salinity on the 8lsO of C. lobatulus since the 0.096 %o\\nshift is an underestimation of RBWT (mean decrease of 0.75 °C) and an\\noverestimation of RBWS (mean salinity increase of 0.16) for the core section 0.5 -\\n102.5 cm. However, it is interesting to note that the 5I80 derived 0.53 salinity\\ndeviation is similar to the 0.52 RBWS increase between 80.5 - 0 cm (the comparable\\nRBWT decrease is 2.1 °C). This suggests that whilst the high frequency S180 is\\nreflecting inter-annual BWT variations, the long-term 8lsO shift may be indicative of\\n1\\nan increase in BWS; a hypothesis supported by more \\'marine\\' 8 C and a benthic\\nforaminiferal response (figure 8.11). Additionally, linear regression lines through the\\n329\\nChapter 8 Late Holocene palaeoenvironmental record\\nA\\n^ 2 Estimated BWT\\nReconstructed Millport SST\\nDate AD\\nB\\n8 t , ,\\n1911 1921 1931 1941 1951 1961 1971 1981 1991 2001\\nDate AD\\nFigure 8.17 (A) Estimated bottom water temperature (BWT; black line) at the Loch Sunart\\nGC023 core site and reconstructed annual Millport temperature (grey line) for the period of\\noverlap for the two series (~1810 - 2001) and (B) for the period AD 1911 -2001. Estimated BWT\\nwas calculated using the 8180 values from GC023 and the Lynch-Steigliz etal., (1999), assuming\\na constant bottom water salinity of 33.6 (as measured at the core site in June 2002).

This exemplifies two important points: that rapid\\nand short-lived climatic events are likely to be recorded in the stable isotopic\\ncomposition of C. lobatulus and that benthic foraminiferal assemblages in Loch\\nSunart can respond quickly to brief fluctuations in main basin bottom water\\nconditions.\\n8.4.5 Magnetic susceptibility and grain size - catchment derived inputs or\\nenhanced current activity?\\nThe upper section of core of GC023 (0-105 cm) is characterised by relatively coarse\\ngrain sizes (more than 4% > 63 pm) and higher magnetic susceptibility (%; figure 8.7)\\nand such increases in % are usually interpreted as signals of increased input from the\\nsurrounding catchment due to weathering or anthropogenically influenced erosion\\n(e.g. Appleby et al., 1985; Andrews et al., 2001; Mikalsen et al., 2001; Sejrup et al.,\\n2001). However, core GC023 also exhibits a moderate and significant 813C: grain size\\nrelationship (figure 8.16); suggesting catchment derived inputs are not solely the cause\\nof the coarse sediment and exemplifying the important role current activity is likely to\\nplay during this period. The predominantly igneous and metamorphic geology of the\\nLoch Sunart catchment (chapter 2) is likely to contain rocks with a significant\\nproportion of the highly magnetic iron (Fe) minerals, such as magnetite (FesO^ and\\nmaghaemite (Fe203; Dearing, 1998) as exemplified by the high concentrations of Fe\\nand Fe203 in core GC023, with the latter increasing towards the core top (figure 8.10).\\nThus the high % seen at the top of the core likely signifies erosional inputs from the\\nsurrounding catchment. The catchment % signal in the bottom half of the core may\\nhave been \\'diluted\\' by paramagnetic or diamagnetic bulk sediment components such\\nas clay or organic matter (figure 8.land table 4.5 in Dearing, 1998), though it is more\\nlikely that catchment inputs were not significant during this period.\\n331\\nChapter 8 Late Holocene palaeoenvironmental record\\n8.4.6 Separating catchment erosion from climatically forced current activity\\nGrain size peaks in the treated sediment samples are not always apparent in the\\nuntreated (raw) sediment grain size record (figure 8.7) suggesting the latter may be\\nmasked by either an organic or calcium carbonate signal. \\'Treated\\' grain size records\\npotentially allow catchment derived grain size variations to be separated from current-\\ndriven grain size variations (e.g. Bianchi & McCave, 1999) and may explain other\\nproxy records. For instance, the treated sediment grain size peak at -180 cm was\\nlikely to have been masked by increased calcium carbonate from the coinciding peak\\nin benthic foraminiferal abundance (figure 8.15) or by marine particulate organic\\nmatter as suggested by the \\'marine\\' C/N ratio (figure 8.15); both of which point to a\\nperiod of enhanced current activity and coastal water influence in the main basin of\\nLoch Sunart. On the other hand, treated sediment grain size from 54.5 cm upwards\\nfollows the raw sediment grain size, pointing towards transportation of fine particles\\naway from the site through stronger current activity, i.e. winnowing, and/or\\ndomination of the grain size record by minerogenic inputs, though winnowing is more\\nprobable.\\nThe isolated grain size peak at 102.5 cm is accompanied by a sharp, brief drop in %\\n(figure 8.7) thus is unlikely to be due to a turbidite or a rapid catchment derived input\\n(Sejrup et al., 2001). The treated sediment grain size curve also peaks near this\\ninterval, pointing to the possibility of enhanced current activity and thus increased\\nmarine influence on bottom waters, which may explain the small increase in benthic\\nforaminiferal abundance (figure 8.15). In the N Atlantic, stronger current activity in\\nthe bottom water is linked to processes of deep convection and is often indicative of\\nwarmer climates (Bianchi & McCave, 1999); the relatively stable and depleted 5180\\naround this level also may reflect climatic forcing in the N Atlantic region.\\nGiven the strong grain size relationships for both % and 813C, it is likely that the grain\\nsize signal in core GC023 records both climatically forced current activity and\\ncatchment derived inputs, influenced by anthropogenic activity and climate driven\\nerosion.\\n332\\nChapter 8 Late Holocene palaeoenvironmental record\\n8.4.7 Catchment derived geochemical signals\\nAs discussed previously, sodium oxide and chloride are likely to reflect the deposition\\nof marine salts in the sediments. Decreasing aluminium oxide (AIO3) towards the\\ncore top is consistent with a change the lithology from mainly clay (typically\\naluminium bearing) to clayey silt (figure 8.1 and 8.10).\\nIncreased concentrations of titanium (TiO) in marine sediments from the Cariaco\\nbasin likely signify periods of wet climate and high fluvial input (Haug et al., 2003\\nand Vlag et al., 2004) since Ti is largely a terrigeneous detrital input. Titanium oxide\\n(TiO%) concentrations in core GC023 are generally higher below 85 cm and fairly\\nlow between 85 - 20 cm, a pattern also seen in the high resolution XRF data (figure\\n8.9 and 8.10). If the Ti records in GC023 reflect climatically-driven changes in\\nterrestrial runoff, then this suggests a drier and variable climate between 208-185 cm,\\nmoving to wetter climate peaking at 160cm, with a gradual shift to a drier climate\\ncoinciding with the grain size peak at 50 cm (figure 8.10). TiO% shifts towards\\nslightly higher values at the core top, pointing to a wetter climate and higher detrital\\ninput to the site, though XRD data is not available for the core top. It is interesting to\\nnote that the peak in TiO% at 160 cm coincides with a peak in benthic foraminiferal\\nabundance, which may (tenuously) reflect a link to climate and productivity (e.g. Kryc\\n& Murray, 2003).\\n8.4.8 Sediment carbon signals - catchment derived or a reflection of marine\\nproductivity?\\nThe increase of Ctotai and shift towards \\'marine\\' C/N ratios towards the core top points\\nto increasing marine productivity thus increased marine organic matter input, as\\nrepresented by P concentration (figure 8.7). The Ctotai peak at 110 cm is not\\naccompanied by a TOC or C/N ratio response suggesting the Ctotai peak probably\\nreflects an inorganic carbon input such as foraminiferal tests.\\nIncreasing TOC towards the core top is consistent with an increase in catchment\\nderived inputs as inferred from the % record (figure 8.7). Marine and estuarine\\nenvironments typically show C/N ratios around 8 (e.g. Middleburg & Nieuwenhuize,\\n333\\nChapter 8 Late Holocene palaeoenvironmental record\\n1998) and terrigeneous material displays C/N ratios ranging from 17-30 (e.g. Andrews\\net al., 1998; Middleburg & Nieuwenhuize, 1998), though estuarine sediments rarely\\nshow strongly terrigeneous (i.e. near 20) C/N ratio signals (Shultz & Calder, 1976).\\nThe C/N ratios in core GC023 fluctuate around a mean ratio of 9.49 ± 0.55 with a C/N\\nratio range of 7.93 - 10.73, suggesting a combination of marine and terrestrial organic\\nmatter at the site with occasional periods of increased and decreased organic inputs\\nfrom the catchment. Loch Sunart C/N ratios are slightly higher than the C/N ratio\\nrange of the deeper Lustrafjorden (Mikalsen et al., 1999), probably due to the shallow\\nsill restricting exchange with coastal waters. Higher C/N ratios coincide with\\nincreased grain size (raw and digested) from around 0-100 cm in core GC023 (figure\\n8.7). This is unexpected since organic matter is usually contained in the finer\\nsediment fractions (Bordovskiy, 1965) and NW Norwegian fjordic records with coarse\\ngrain sizes typically show low organic content (Mikalsen et al., 2001). However, the\\nhigh C/N ratios in GC023 point to a significant terrigenous input during this period\\nwhich agrees with the % record.\\n8.4.9 Palaeoenvironmental record from GC023 in context with other climatic or\\nenvironmental records.\\nAs mentioned previously, problems with geochronology severely hinder the\\ninterpretation of palaeoenvironmental conditions from core GC023, and sample\\nresolution is low between ~ AD 700 - 1900 (1250 cal BP - 50 cal BP; figure 8.18).\\nHowever, the data does show the potential of high resolution reconstructions from\\nthese sea loch archives, with sampling resolutions (excluding the \\'core gap\\') of 1 cm\\nper year for the top half of the core (using Pb-Cs chronology) and 1 cm per 4-10 years\\nfor the bottom half of the core (> 105 cm).\\n8.4.9.1 Cool temperatures during the Roman Warm Period?\\nProxies from the base of GC023 (C. lobatulus abundance, grain size > 63 pm and\\n1 3\\nenriched 5 C) point to slightly increased current activity between 200 - 85 BC.\\nEnhanced current activity typically suggests warmer temperatures (e.g. Bianchi &\\nMcCave, 1999b), however RBWT is cooler during this period which agrees well with\\n334\\ncalyrBP\\nFigure8.18Majorproxi sfromL chSunartcGC023l ttedbyg(AD).Alsshownre:18180tISP2i(http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/paleo/icec re/greenland/ ummit/document/gispisot.htm; 2)5180and8 3CfromT gusDeltaUvigerinasp.(dabtainedH lgB t elJonsdottir);3)Sogn fj rden(Uvi rinam ditter naea),Ra a n(Ca s dul ala v g t )N rwegima gi (N.pachydermad.)-d tafromDr.D.Kiltg ard-Kristensen;4)esti dbot owatertempera ure(BWT)Andfj d nndSul fj afrDr.G Mikals );5l rc ivityreco(C wley,1999-do http://www.cru.uea.ac.uk/cru/data/paleo/jonesmann04).6)Bi nchi&McC ve(1999)sor bliltd a-fast sl wph s srepresentedbylac /w ish dingre ctively.;7R onstruct dp e ipi iodf t bogsshowtransitionsetweedryperi d(w te)n t(black);8)Timi gfhchangiat osph riccirculationov rN r hAtl i(M r&ye ki,2002 ;914 0lBPIRDe e tfd at.,(1997)nd0)the535AD\\'nuclearwi t d(Woh tz,2000).Eve ts-Dr pres ntp iofextr melyde le8 3Cicor G 023.Ev nid n ifiesttim gft fjordiccir ul ionshiftxyg nat d conditionsa dinferredcreasem rinefluence.\\nGO\\nGO\\nGO\\nChapter 8 Late Holocene palaeoenvironmental record\\nevidence of climatic deterioration in Malangenfjord (Husum & Hald, 2004a),\\nSulafjorden and Andfjorden (Dr. G .

Conversely,\\nGC023 S180 appears to be depleted (figure 8.18); this may reflect lower salinity basin\\nwater but is consistent with other records showing evidence of warmer temperatures\\nduring this period, e.g. the depleted 8lsO from the Tagus Delta (data from Dr. H. B.\\nBartels; Abrantes et al., in press) and the GISP 2 ice core (figure 8.18).\\n8.4.9.2 Changes in fjordic circulation atAD 500?\\n1 -5\\nThe long-term shift of 5 C along with indicators of increased oxygenation such as Mn\\nat 160.5 cm point to a major change in fjordic hydrography at approximately AD 500\\n(1450 BP or 160.5 cm). Once again, it is important to remember that the problematic\\ngeochronology greatly hinders the reconstruction of palaeoenvironmental conditions\\nin Loch Sunart over the past 2 millennia. Therefore, following section explores the\\npotential mechanisms driving this circulation change, though only tenuous links\\nbetween the GC023 record and other palaeoclimatic records can be resolved.\\n8.4.9.2i Regional sea level change?\\nLoch Sunart is likely to have experienced a long-term isostatic sea level drop of ~ 2m\\nduring the last 2000 years (Shennan et al., 1995) with sea level being around 1.45 m\\nhigher at AD 500 than at present (Shennan & Horton, 2002). Isostatic rebound of\\nshallow-silled Scandinavian fjords, for example, has led to anoxic conditions in some\\nbasins (Gustafsson & Nordberg, 2002). However, the main basin sill depth (~ 35 m)\\nof Loch Sunart lies well below (~ 15 m) the present day halocline and brackish\\nintermediate layer and Loch Sunart is regularly flushed by deep water renewal events\\n(Gillibrand et al., 1995). It is possible that the 1.45 m decrease in sea level has\\ncrossed some circulation threshold, increasing the vigour of coastal-basin exchange\\nand resulting in increased marine coastal water reaching the bottom water of the core\\nsite and presently, both tidal and current activity influences main basin bottom water\\nin Loch Sunart (pers. comm., Dr. P Gillibrand, 2004) thus bottom water is rarely\\nstagnant.\\n336\\nChapter 8 Late Holocene palaeoenvironmental record\\n8.4.9.2U Changes in open Atlantic conditions\\nAn ice rafted detritus (IRD) event, similar to a glacial Heinrich event (Andrews,\\n1998), occurred in the NE Atlantic around AD 550 (1400 cal BP) and these IRD\\nevents are typically accompanied by injections of cooler and fresher water (probably\\nfrom the Greenland Sea) into the core of the North Atlantic Current (Bond et al.,\\n1997). Two distinct S180 events occur in core GC023 around this time. The first is the\\nisolated 0.5 %c enrichment of S180 at ~ AD 496 (1454 cal BP; 161.5 cm) suggesting a\\ntemperature change of 2.3°C (figure 8.18). This inferred temperature reduction is of\\nsimilar magnitude to the 1.7 °C cooling in the reconstructed summer bottom water\\ntemperature record (figure 8.18) and similar to the extent of surface ocean cooling\\npostulated for this period by Bond et al., (1997) and Marchitto & deMenocal (2003).\\nHowever, these IRD events are likely to have lasted a few 100 years and given the\\nhigh resolution of GC023, it is unlikely to reflect the whole IRD event. GC023 8lsO\\nshows a period of relatively enriched 5180 between AD 525-600 (1422 - 1350 cal\\nBP), suggesting a cooling of around 0.5 °C which may reflect cooler temperatures\\nduring an IRD event at this time. The low variability in 5180 during this interval\\n(given the usually high frequency) points to a possible change in local circulation or\\nlocal climate regime which may have been driven by changes in the North Atlantic\\nclimate regime.\\nThe cool RBWT correlates with a period known as the Dark Ages Cold Period\\n1 Q\\n(DACP; figure 8.18) which has also been recorded in speleothem 8 O from SW\\nIreland (McDermott et al., 2001) and sortable silt records from the NE Atlantic\\n(Bianchi & McCave, 1999). Reconstructed bottom water temperature for Sulafjorden\\nis also cool around AD 560 (pers comm., Dr. G Mikalsen, 2004; figure 8.18), and\\nBolivina skaggerakensis (a benthic foraminiferal taxa often associated with climatic\\ndeterioration; Husum & Hald, 2004a) appears in the Voldafjorden around AD 500\\nwith a cooling of BWT occurring around AD 650 (HOLSMEER report, 2004). Given\\nthe circulation of the NE Atlantic (chapter 1), it is likely that these temperature\\nchanges are being driven by the same process driving the Sunart temperature change.\\nThe foraminiferal 813C during the DACP interval is relatively enriched considering\\nIRD events are typically accompanied by fluxes of freshwater into the Atlantic\\n(chapter 1), causing reduced thermohaline circulation (Bond et al., 1999) and regional\\n337\\nChapter 8 Late Holocene palaeoenvironmental record\\ncooling (Bond et al., 1997). Climate regime change in the North Atlantic is likely to\\ninfluence the regime in the local catchment around Loch Sunart. However,\\nMcDermott et al., (2001) suggest the IRD event at 1400 cal BP may not have caused a\\nhuge salinity change in the N Atlantic. Grain size in core GC023 is relatively fine¬\\ngrained, and this may be linked to sluggish circulation of the NE Atlantic waters\\n(figure 8.18; Bianchi & McCave, 1999). The AD 500 IRD event correlates with a\\nperiod of high Na+ in the GISP2 ice core; an indicator of storminess in the North\\nAtlantic (O\\' Brien et al., 1995; Bond et al., 1997) and increased precipitation during\\nthis time may have resulted in enhanced stratification and enhanced circulation.\\nRegionally, peat bogs suggest that the period between AD 400-850 was fairly dry\\n(figure 8.18; Anderson, 1998 and Barber et al., 1999), though Anderson, 1998 points\\nout that reconstructions from other British peat bogs indicated a wet climate at this\\ntime.\\n8.4.9.2M Volcanically forced climate?\\n1 o\\nIt may be possible that the 5 O spike at ~ AD 500 represents the nuclear winter of ~\\nAD 536, forced by the eruption of Krakatoa (Wohletz, 2000) during the DACP. Poor\\nchronology and uncertainty in calibrated radiocarbon ages make it impossible to tie-\\ndown such events in the GC023 record.\\n8.4.9.2iv The onset of the Medieval Warm Period?\\nThe grain size peak at ~ 102.5 cm has an estimated age of ~ AD 1000, bearing in mind\\nthe uncertainty in the geochronology of core GC023, this age may not be accurate.\\nRegionally, the Medieval Warm Period (MWP) has been recorded in speleothem 8180\\nand dated as being centred about 1000 ± 200 cal BP (McDermott et al., 2001).\\nSortable silt records from a deep water NE Atlantic core suggest more vigorous\\nactivity accompanies warmer climatic periods such as the MWP and Roman Warm\\nPeriod, indicating the importance of thermohaline circulation variability to millennial\\nand centennial scale climatic variability of the NE Atlantic region during the Holocene\\n(Bianchi & McCave, 1999). A short period of high frequency 5180 oscillations occurs\\njust prior to the accepted onset of the Medieval Warm Period, between AD 650-700\\nand may represent a reorganisation of circulation or climate regime, similar to those\\n338\\nChapter 8 Late Holocene palaeoenvironmental record\\n1 R\\nseen in other records (e.g. Hall et al., 2004). The slight 8 O depletion in core GC023\\naround AD 1000 suggests either warmer temperatures, as recorded in the GISP2 ice\\ncore record (figure 8.10) and N Atlantic sortable silt records (Bianchi & McCave,\\n1999) or a period of fresher salinity from an increased runoff from the wet climate of\\nthe catchment (Anderson, 1998; Barber et al., 1999; figure 8.18). Though titanium\\ncan indicate periods of wet climate (e.g. Haug et al., 2003), the environmental controls\\non titanium concentration in the sediments of Scottish fjords has not been established,\\nand GC023 shows no agreement with regional precipitation records (figure 8.18).\\nThe long term 813C shift in Loch Sunart suggests an onset of fjordic circulation\\n1 8\\nchanges at ~ AD 540, yet the long-term shift towards enriched 8 O values begins\\naround AD 940 pointing to either a decrease in BWT or a slight increase in BWS.\\nMany of the regional studies associated with the HOLSMEER project showed\\nsignificant changes at - AD 1000 (HOLSMEER report, 2004). Though NE Atlantic\\ncirculation appeared to become more vigorous during this time (Bianchi & McCave,\\n1999) as also suggested by treated sediment grain size for GC023, weaker bottom\\ncurrents are inferred for the Icelandic shelf, increasing B. skaggerakensis and\\ndecreasing Cassidulina laevigata abundances point to climatic deterioration in\\n1 ^\\nVoldafjorden and a shift towards enriched 8 C of Uvigerina mediterranea points to\\nweaker turbulence, lower salinity and restricted upwelling (HOLSMEER report,\\n2004).\\n8.4.9.3 Long term cooling trend from ~ AD 1000 to the 19th Century\\nThe grain size peak at AD 1000 occurs within a section of geochronological\\nuncertainity and may tenuously reflect winnowing linked to faster bottom water\\nactivity in the N Atlantic (Bianchi & McCave, 1999; figure 8.18). Coarse sediments\\nin GC023 from around AD 1000 to 1900, suggests enhanced current activity and the\\nwinnowing of sediments at the core site during this time means that climatic periods\\nwithin this interval, i.e. the LIA and MWP, cannot be fully resolved.\\n1 R\\nA period of relatively enriched 8 O and inferred cooler BWT between ~ AD 1531-\\n1700 agrees well with temperature records from Ranafjorden (figure 8.18). However,\\n8lsO becomes more enriched towards the top of the core (figures 8.12 and 8.18),\\n339\\nChapter 8 Late Holocene palaeoenvironmental record\\nduring a period where both global and marine temperatures are known to be higher\\n(chapters 1 and 3). More apparent is the depleted S13C between AD 1700-1841, which\\npoints to fresher salinities or reduced fjordic circulation (figure 8.18) and agrees well\\nwith proxy records of precipitation from Scottish peat bogs (Anderson, 1998; Barber\\net al., 1999).\\n8.4.9.4 Environmental records from the AD 1900 to present.\\nThe cooling of Loch Sunart BWT from ~ AD 1920 is not consistent with global air\\ntemperature records or NW Scottish marine temperature series which typically show\\nwarming from around AD 1920 (e.g. Mann et al., 1998 and chapter 3). Andrews et\\nal., (2001) report a shift to more arctic conditions (decreasing temperature and\\nsalinity) in N Iceland fjords. Temperature and 5180 records from the Norwegian\\nfjords (which should experience similar climate systems to NW Scotland) typically\\nshow a warming trend (figure 8.19 and Kristensen et al., 2004). The difference in the\\nlong-term bottom water trend from Loch Sunart may reflect the impact of changes in\\nthe N Atlantic circulation and climate upon the hydrography of the fjord.\\nThe late 19th and 20th century has been characterised by storminess in the N Atlantic,\\nwhich has a complex relationship with the NAO index (Dawson et al., 2002).\\nEnhanced mixing of the coastal shelf seas during recent periods of high NAO (i.e. post\\nAD 1920) along with increased stratification in Loch Sunart (due to increased\\nprecipitation) may have resulted in enhanced estuarine circulation (chapter 3 and\\nGillibrand et al., 2005) leading to more saline and cooler coastal bottom water\\nentering the main basin of Loch Sunart, despite increasing temperature records\\nelsewhere (chapter 1). This hypothesis is supported by relatively enriched S13C and\\n8loO values and the increasing presence of benthic foramimteral taxa with an affinity\\nfor \\'cooler saline\\' waters, e.g. A. glomeratum, Bolivina spp. and E. vitrea (figure 8.6\\nand chapter 6). Additionally, depleted GC023 C. lobatulus 5lsO appears to correlate\\nwith higher annual precipitation for England and Wales (figure 8.19), once again\\npointing to enhanced estuarine circulation during the recent warm period.\\nNot all warm periods are accompanied by NAO-like behaviour and our current\\nclimate is much stormier than during the MWP (Dawson et al., 2004) and chemical\\n340\\nFigure8.19LochSunartcoGC023proxi sfAD19 C-200 .Thehangic rege chronclogysvisibla~12.lhowr :)trec nstruc edMi lportm in temperaturese ies(schapter3andfigur8.9);2Engl ndcWalpr ci ationi(dfromhttp://www.cru.uea. c.uk/~mikeh/dat se s/uk/engwales.htm);3)t GISP28180record;4)stableiso opdatafr mtheT gusD lta(Por gal;obtainr.HB r lsJ nsd ttir)55 0tRa afjord nndtN rwegi Margin(Kristenseneta!.,2004;d ob ainedf mDr.iltga rd-Hriste sen);6)bot omw t rtemp atu eAndfjo ndMalangenfjor e(d afG Mikalsen);7)solaractivityndv lc nicignals(Cr wley,1999dobtai dfr mhttp://www.cru.uea.ac.uk/cru/data/paleo/jonesmann04)8N.Atl ticGreS ity Anomalies(GSA,Belkint !.,1998andBelkin,2004) PeriodswithinGC023here5180correlat sitharmph seinoth rrecordars wnby;luintt olperio .\\nChapter 8 Late Holocene palaeoenvironmental record\\nchanges in the GISP2 ice core suggest the mode of atmospheric circulation over the\\nNorth Atlantic region switched around AD 1400 (Meeker & Mayewski, 2002). This\\nmay explain why GC023 proxies during the MWP do not display the same enhanced\\nstratification/coastal mixing as proxies from the past 100 years and the Roman Warm\\nPeriod (figure 8.19).\\nThe recent shift towards depleted 513C at around AD 1985 may reflect a reduction in\\ncurrent activity with less influence of coastal waters to the core site as suggested by\\nthe decrease in grain size (figure 8.19). Hansen et al., (2001) report a decrease in the\\nFaroe-Shetland overflow since 1950 and postulate a possible decrease in Atlantic\\nwater inflow (i.e. reduced thermohaline circulation) which may result in less \\'marine\\'\\nwater to the coastal hydrography outside Loch Sunart and thus the fjord itself.\\nHowever, given the propensity for North Atlantic storminess and increased wave\\nheight associated with the high index NAO phase during this time (Dawson et al.,\\n2002), one may also expect vigorous current activity and enhanced circulation in Loch\\nSunart (Gillibrand et al., 2005). Additionally, during high index NAO years,\\nhydrography in the Rockall trough (and likely the Hebridean shelf) is typically\\nwarmer and more saline (figure 7.12 and Holliday, 2003) thus one may expect 813C\\nvalues typical of \\'marine\\' waters in Loch Sunart bottom waters.\\nDespite differences in the long-term BWT trends, periods of cool and warm BWT\\ninferred from GC023 S180 agree well with other instrumental and palaeoclimate\\nrecords of the last 100 years (figure 8.19). The best agreement is with the\\nMalangenfjord and Andfjorden BWT record which show similar climatic trends to the\\nreconstructed Millport temperature series, thus exemplifying the sensitivity of these\\nNW European fjord records to N Atlantic climate.\\n8.4.10 Signals from the catchment - climate driven or anthropogenic?\\nThe magnetic susceptibility (%) curve of GC023 is typical of many other fjordic or\\nlacustrine records; increasing towards the core top before shifting to decreased values\\nin recent times e.g. Andrews et al., (2001); Mikalsen et al., (2001) and Husum & Hald\\n(2004a). However, the onset of higher % in these records typically occur before -600\\n342\\nChapter 8 Late Holocene palaeoenvironmental record\\nBC (-2500 cal BP) whereas the gradual increase in Loch Sunart commences around -\\nAD 700 (-1250 cal BP) with the rapid and large increase beginning at - AD 1900\\n(figure 8.18). Whether this is due to the shorter time span of GC023 (-2050 cal BP),\\nproblems in geochronology or differences in settlement times and anthropogenic\\nactivity (such as woodland clearance) is difficult to identify. Certainly Anderson\\n(1998) finds evidence of human activity at - 3300 cal BP in Wester Ross, and\\nMacklin et al., (2000) found that anthropogenic activities began to impact on the Oban\\nenvironment around 1000 BP. Andrews et al., (2001) suggested that the increase in %\\naround 1000 cal BP in a marine sediment core from Reykjarfjordur (Iceland) was\\nassociated with a climatically influenced decrease in carbonate in the sediments rather\\nthan an anthropogenic signal. However, the increase in total organic carbon and shift\\nto slightly higher C/N ratios during the % peak suggests that % in Loch Sunart is\\nprimarily a catchment derived signal, potentially modified by enhanced bottom\\ncurrent activity and increased runoof from the catchment. The intensive forest\\nmanagement of the Sunart oakswoods peaked during the 18th and 19th centuries\\n(www.sunartoakwoods.org.uk) and this agrees well with the onset of increased % as a\\ncatchment signal, and % could also be influenced by heather burning since % is\\nmassively increased in burnt top soil (Smith, 1998).\\nGiven the strength of the grain size:813C and grain size: % relationships, it is likely that\\nthe x and grain size signals in GC023 record both climatically induced and\\nanthropogenically influenced erosion from the catchment. The influence of catchment\\nderived inputs to the core site could be further explored by the \\'unmixing\\' of mineral\\nmagnetic signatures to identify the \\'source\\' (e.g. Lees, 1998) and by looking at pollen\\nin the marine records (e.g. Scourse et al., in press).\\n8.4.11 Anthropogenic signals of pollution\\n1 \"3\\nAnother possible explanation for the trend towards depleted 5 C is the influence of\\nanthropogenic carbon in the North Atlantic, commonly termed the \\'oceanic Suess\\neffect\\' (e.g. Sonnerup et al., 1999; Kortzinger et al., 2003). The uptake of isotopically\\nlight anthropogenic CO2 into the ocean via air-sea interactions and deep water\\n1 q\\nproduction in the North Atlantic (Kroopnick, 1985) has seen a mean global 8 C\\n343\\nChapter 8 Late Holocene palaeoenvironmental record\\nchange of -0.16 ± 0.02 %c per decade between 1970 and 1990 (Quay et al., 2003) and\\nanomalous S13C has been recorded in surface waters around the NE Atlantic (Keir et\\nal., 1998). However, if the shift towards depleted 513C at AD 1985 is due to the\\ninfluence of anthropogenic CO2 then it is surprising, given the rapid exchange\\nbetween atmospheric C02 and freshwater (Broecker & Walton, 1959; Spiker, 1980),\\n1 o\\nthat an anthropogenic 5 C signal is not seen earlier in the GC023 record.\\nDespite concerns regarding the feasibility of using the high resolution XRF\\ngeochemical data, zinc appears to show a significant increase beginning around AD\\n1900, which is similar to the distinct anthropogenic zinc signal commencing around\\nAD 1850 in Loch Chon, Central Scotland (Roberts, 1998). Additionally, the\\npredominantly marine signal accompanying the sharp rise in TOC input at ~ AD 1995\\nis not accompanied by catchment or climatically driven grain size variations and may\\nreflect enhanced organic carbon input from the most recent phase of anthropogenic\\nactivity, i.e. fish farming in Loch Sunart (Gillibrand et al., 1996).\\n8.4.12 Climate forcing during the last 2000 years\\nSpectral analysis (using PAST; Hammer et al., 2001) on the two core sections where\\ngeochronology is most secure (0-69.5 cm and 104.5 - 290 cm) suggests no significant\\n10 10\\ncycles exist in the GC023 5 O records. The highest powered 8 O cycles are 16 years\\n(P = 6.33, when P significant at 95 % = 8.89), 26 years (P = 5.05), 12 years (P=4.91)\\nand 11 year cycles (P = 4.39) and were present in only the lower half of the core.\\nCycles lasting 25-27 years have been found in the Central England Temperature\\n(CET) series and the Koch sea ice index respectively and a cycle lasting 29 years has\\n1 R\\nbeen reported for the GISP2 8 O record (references contained in O\\'Sullivan et al.,\\n2002). Similarly, 11-12 year cycles are common in both instrumental and\\npalaeoclimatic records (references in O\\'Sullivan et al., 2002) and are consistent with\\nthe 11 year Schwabe sun spot cycle, pointing to the possibility that the C. lobatulus\\n1 R\\n8 O of Loch Sunart responds to solar forced climate variability in the NE Atlantic\\n(e.g. Mikalsen & Sejrup, 1999; Bond et al., 2001).\\nThe NAO is a major influence on N Atlantic climate (chapter 1), however the\\nrelationship between oceanic circulation and particularly the coastal hydrography of\\n344\\nChapter 8 Late Holocene palaeoenvironmental record\\nNW Scotland and the NAO is complex (chapter 1; Holliday, 2003) as figure 8.19\\nshows. Some prolonged periods of enriched 8lsO occur during low solar activity and\\nhigh volcanic signal (figure 8.19) supporting the hypothesis that Loch Sunart\\npalaeorecords could be recording solar variability, as reported for other palaeoclimatic\\nrecords from NW Scotland (e.g. Baker et al., 1999; Mikalsen & Sejrup, 1999; Cooper\\net al., 2000; O\\'Sullivan et al., 2002) or solar forced NAO fluctuations (Boberg &\\nLundstedt, 2002).\\nThe lower section of GC023 shows a significant 513C cycle at 800 years (P = 15.05\\nwhen P95 = 8.89), however this peak must be interpreted with care, since only 1 cycle\\nexists in the given chronology for the GC023 section (899 cal years). Though 800\\nyear cycles have been reported for N British peat bogs (Barber et al., 1994 and Oliver\\net al., 1997), cycles of this periodicity are fairly uncommon (e.g. Chambers &\\nBlackford, 2001; O\\'Sullivan et al., 2002). The closest reported cycle is the 720 and\\n951 year atmospheric A14 cycles of Stuiver & Braziunas (1996), though it is possible\\nthat the 800 year cycle may be connected with the N Atlantic 1500 year cycle\\n(references in O\\'Sullivan et al., 2002). Interpretation of GC023 palaeoenvironmental\\nproxies and possible cyclicity must be approached with caution due to poor\\nchronology. Futher work on high resolution sediment cores from Loch Sunart\\nspanning over a longer time scale would improve the identification of possible\\nclimatically forced periodicity.\\n8.5. Conclusion\\nPalaeoenvironmental reconstructions from Loch Sunart suggest that these high\\nresolution sedimentary archives have the potential to resolve inter-annual marine\\nclimate variability and capture an integrated record of changes in the catchment and\\nmarine environment. Various proxies point to a change in fjordic circulation around\\nAD 500, the cause of which is not clear. Possibilities include a threshold change in\\nfjordic circulation due to isostatic sea level fall or changes in open N Atlantic\\nconditions. C. lobatulus 813C likely records the 813CDic of main basin bottom water\\nand points to an increasing influence of coastal water at the core site during the last\\n2000 years, also starting around AD 500. Carefully evaluated age-control data\\n345\\nChapter 8 Late Holocene palaeoenvironmental record\\nhighlights problematic geochronology which makes it impossible to resolve climate\\nand environmental change during the Medieval Warm Period and Little Ice Age, and\\ninhibits the interpretation of the development of the fjordic circulation change\\ncontinuously through the last 2000 years.\\nComparison of the C. lobatulus 8lsO record with a long reconstructed marine\\ntemperature series demonstrates that the test chemistry of C. lobatulus from the main\\nbasin records inter-annual variations in bottom water temperature of a similar\\n18\\nmagnitude to instrumental data. Additionally, the agreement of C. lobatulus 8 O and\\nRBWT point to cooler bottom water temperatures and/or higher salinities during the\\n20th century warm period and also during the Roman Warm Period. This is likely due\\nto increased stratification leading to enhanced estuarine circulation \\'pulling\\' cooler\\nand more saline coastal waters to the core site.\\nThe problematic geochronology for core GC023 along with it\\'s relatively short time\\nspan, negates the identification of millennial scale climate cycles often seen in recent\\nlate Holocene records (e.g. Bond et al., 1997; Cooper et al., 2000; Keigwin & Boyle,\\n2000; Wunsch, 2000; Battarbee et al., 2001; Bond et al., 2001; O\\'Sullivan et al., 2002;\\nClemens, 2005). However, the good agreement of GC023 palaeoclimate proxies with\\nother N Atlantic records exemplifies the sensitivity of these marginal environments to\\nregional circulation and climate forcing mechanisms. The strong catchment signal\\nsuggests the possibility of obtaining high resolution records of linked\\npalaeoenvironmental changes in terrestrial and marine climate and demonstrates the\\nsensitivity of these environments to anthropogenic influences.\\n346\\nChapter 9 Conclusions and Further work\\nChapter 9 - Conclusions and FurtherWork\\nRecently, millennial-scale climate changes have been observed in marine sedimentary\\narchives and high resolution ice core records covering the last glacial period and\\ncontinuing into the Holocene, suggesting Holocene climate is not as stable as once\\nthought (e.g. Mayewski et al., 2004). Initially this millennial-scale variability was\\nattributed to changes in the global thermohaline circulation (THC; Broecker et al.,\\n1990); however the recent identification of centennial and decadal-scale variability in\\npalaeoclimatic records (e.g. Hall et al., 2004; Andresen et al., 2005) suggests factors\\nother than the rate and location of deep ocean ventilation, such as solar variability or\\nan Atlantic multi-decadal oscillation are also likely to be causal factors in long-term\\nclimate change (Kerr, 2000).\\nShelf sea areas, such as sea lochs or fjords, are sensitive to climatic processes,\\ntypically yield high sediment accumulation rates (~ 0.5 cm yr\"1) and have the potential\\nto capture land-ocean interactions (Scourse & Austin, 2002). The west coast of\\nScotland lies in a climatically sensitive region of the North Atlantic (e.g. Holliday,\\n2003), thus it is likely that Scottish sea loch sediments also capture North Atlantic\\nclimatic variability, possibly with sub-decadal resolution. Few studies have utilized\\npalaeoenvironmental archives from Scottish sea lochs and those that have, focused on\\neither the deglacial period (Dix & Duck, 2000; Howe et al., 2002) or on recent (last\\n200 years) records from the restricted basins of Loch Etive (Murray et al., 2003).\\nTherefore, the primary aim of this study was to investigate the potential of obtaining\\nhigh resolution palaeoenvironmental records from Loch Sunart, a fjord on the NW\\ncoast of Scotland. In order to achieve reliable palaeoenvironmental reconstructions,\\nthere was a clear requirement to understand how modern processes influence the study\\nsite. To accomplish these objectives, a ~3 m sediment core (GC023) with a\\nsedimentation rate of approximately 0.1 cm yr\"1 back to 2090 ±120 years BP was\\nrecovered from the Dun Ghallain Deep in the main basin of Loch Sunart, and a suite\\nof surface sediment samples and accompanying hydrographic data were obtained\\nduring a series of research cruises in Loch Sunart between April 2001 and June 2002.\\nAdditionally, the marine radiocarbon reservoir age of NW Scottish coastal waters was\\n347\\nChapter 9 Conclusions and Further work\\ndetermined using museum acquired, historically collected marine bivalve shells.\\nGiven the broad spectrum of subjects covered by this thesis, chapters were split into\\nthemes, each chapter focusing on the specific objectives to be investigated (section\\n1.10) and containing detailed conclusions. A synopsis of chapter conclusions are\\npresented here in order to provide an over-view of the main findings.\\n9.1 Conclusions toModern Processes: Physical Environment\\n9.1.1. Can regional indices of long-term climate explain the weather experienced\\nby the Loch Sunart catchment and is there a link between regional coastal\\nwater temperatures and air temperatures which is coherent with indices of\\ninter-annual climatic variability such as the North Atlantic Oscillation\\n(NAO)?\\nAir temperature recorded in the Loch Sunart catchment over a 2 year period ( AD\\n2000-2002) reflect the climate experienced by the majority of the Scottish mainland,\\nwhich in turn is strongly influenced by coastal water temperatures via oceanic heat\\ntransfer and thermal inertia. Scottish air temperatures correlate well with sea surface\\ntemperatures from Millport (MPT) on the Scottish west coast. Therefore, the MPT\\nseries was extended beyond the period of observation (AD 1953-2001) to AD 1800\\nvia the application of a regression equation derived from the period of overlap\\nbetween the Millport and Scottish mainland temperature (SMT) data. Additionally,\\nthe inner and main basin of Loch Sunart (at 40 m water depth) show a strong seasonal\\nheating cycle, typical of mid-latitude shelf seas, which agrees well with MPT data,\\nfurther advocating the value of the reconstructed Millport sea surface temperature\\nseries (RMPT) to hindcast temperatures experienced by Loch Sunart basin waters.\\nSimilarity between long-term SMT and \\'open\\' coastal sea surface temperature (SSTA;\\nHOLSMEER data) records, and also between SMT and winter NAO indices (Jones et\\nal., 1997), suggests the reconstructed and extended Millport marine temperature series\\nreflects long-term climate variability in the wider North Atlantic region. Thus, the\\nextended marine temperature series can be used for direct comparison with the proxy\\nderived palaeotemperature records obtained from Loch Sunart.\\nDetailed data and discussion can be found in chapters 3 and 8.\\n348\\nChapter 9 Conclusions and Further work\\n9.1.2 Is the jjordic circulation of Loch Sunart influenced by extreme states of\\natmospheric forcing mechanisms?\\nGiven the importance of climatic parameters (such as wind stress and freshwater\\ninputs) to fjordic hydrography, the circulation of Loch Sunart basins were expected to\\nshow a response to the NAO. To test whether the Loch Sunart basin hydrography was\\nsignificantly modulated by climatic influences during differing phases of the NAO,\\nthe circulation of the inner and main basin was modelled using an existing circulation\\nmodel (Elliott et al., 1992; Gillibrand et al., 1995) with along-channel wind stress,\\nriver discharge and surface elevation at the loch mouth as inputs. Modelling results\\nfrom the inner basin of Loch Sunart showed meteorological forcing during the\\npositive NAO year of 1988-89 resulted in less frequent deep water renewal events\\n(DWREs), greater salinity variability and a lower annual mean salinity (by 0.52) than\\nfor the negative NAO year of 1995-96. The NAO appeared to have little influence on\\nmain basin salinity (salinity difference of 0.02), despite significant variations in the\\nnumber of renewal days and inflow of water into the basin (negative NAO year =171\\nrenewal days and a mean inflow of 694 mV1; positive NAO year = 120 renewal days\\nand a mean inflow of -239 mV1). The modelling results agreed well with the\\nobserved basin water temperature and salinity response (recorded hourly by stationary\\nmoorings placed at 40 m water depth in the main basin between 7/04/01 to 17/6/02,\\nand in the inner basin between 27/6/01 to 18/6/02) to precipitation recorded in the\\nLoch Sunart catchment. These data demonstrated a clear response of inner basin\\nhydrography to freshwater inputs, with DWREs typically occurring during periods of\\nlow precipitation in the catchment, i.e. probable periods of low freshwater input into\\nthe inner basin, whilst main basin salinity remained relatively stable throughout the\\nyear. Salinity variations showed negligible impact on the steadily evolving seasonal\\nheating cycle. The main basin temperature cycle (maximum and minimum\\ntemperatures of 13.4 °C and 7.9 °C respectively) lagged behind the inner basin\\ntemperature (maximum and minimum temperatures of 13.4 °C and 7.7 °C\\nrespectively) by about 10 days. This lag likely exemplifies the stronger coupling of\\nthe inner basin hydrography to atmospheric processes.\\nDetailed data and discussion can be found in chapter 3. This work was carried out in\\ncollaboration with Dr. P. A. Gillibrand and Dr. W. E. N. Austin and published in\\nContinental Shelf Research, volume 25, in 2005.\\n349\\nChapter 9 Conclusions and Further work\\n9.1.3 Does the high freshwater input into NW Scottish coastal waters and\\nrestricted exchange of fjord water with coastal waters contribute to\\nregionally \\'younger\\' marine radiocarbon reservoir ages, i.e. a negative AR\\nvalue with respect to the global surface ocean reservoir age of400years?\\nFreshwater typically exhibits an isotopic signal close to atmospheric 14C/12C\\n(Broecker & Walton, 1959) and the igneous geology of NW Scotland, together with\\nsteep-sloped catchments, generally cause the high annual amount of rainfall (primarily\\norographic) to be rapidly translated to surface runoff and freshwater inputs into the sea\\nloch (Black & Cranston, 1995). Harkness (1983) radiocarbon dated historically\\ncollected marine molluscs shells and determined a marine radiocarbon reservoir age of\\n405 years for UK coastal waters. Given a conservative mixing relationship, fjordic\\nwaters are likely to have \\'younger\\' apparent ages than the global average surface\\nocean radiocarbon reservoir age of R(t) = 400 years, AR = 0 (Stuiver & Braziunas,\\n1993). Accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) radiocarbon dating of museum shells\\nwith a known year of collection (pre-bomb, i.e. pre-1950) yielded a regional AR value\\nof -27 ±11 years, which is statistically different (at a confidence level of 99.5%) to\\nthe AR value of 14 ± 13 years reported for UK coastal waters (Harkness, 1983) and in\\ngood agreement with the -33 ± 93 years reported by Reimer et al., (2002). This\\nregional AR value was used to correct radiocarbon dates obtained from cores GC023\\nand SC023 and it is recommended that a correction factor of AR = -27 ±11 years\\nshould be applied to marine radiocarbon dates from the NW coast of Scotland during\\nthe calibration process.\\nDetailed data and discussion can be found in chapter 4.\\n9.1.4 Can the modern benthic foraminiferal distribution in Loch Sunart surface\\nsediments be related to environmental controls?\\nThe modem distribution of Loch Sunart benthic foraminifera (> 125 pm) was\\ndetermined from a suite of 31 spatially distributed samples representing a range of\\nwater depths (5-121 m). Loch Sunart surface sediments typically yield higher benthic\\nforaminiferal species diversities and abundances than reported for nearby shelf sites\\n(Murray, 2003) or for many NW European fjord sites; possible due to the relatively\\n350\\nChapter 9 Conclusions and Further work\\nshallow basin depths and frequent DWREs. Multivariate statistical methods (cluster\\nanalysis, non-metric multi-dimensional scaling and factor analysis) identified 4\\nbenthic foraminiferal assemblages reflecting; A) a restricted and stressed environment\\n(found in the inner basin); B) high current activity; C) stratification and a calm\\ndepositional environment; D) coastal water influence.\\nAssemblage group A comprises of samples primarily obtained from the inner basin of\\nLoch Sunart and is dominated by agglutinated taxa (> 70%), in particular,\\nEggerelloides scaber. This dominance by a single species, along with the presence of\\nhyaline taxa such as A. beccarii, E. excavatum and B. marginata (which are known to\\nbe tolerant to variable conditions), likely reflects the stressed environment\\nexperienced by inner basin benthic foraminifera due to low salinities (< 33), variable\\nseasonal conditions (i.e. a strong heating cycle) and high organic matter inputs (7.2 ±\\n5.5 %). Low proportions of hyaline taxa (often with \\'etched\\' tests) and the near-\\nabsence of benthic foraminifera with a porcelaneous wall structure, point to low\\navailability of dissolved carbonate in the brackish inner basin waters and post-mortem\\ncarbonate dissolution.\\nAssemblage group B is dominated by \\'high energy\\' taxa such as Cibicides lobatulus,\\nAmmonia beccarii, Asterigerinata mamilla and Spiroplectaminna wrightii, with at\\nleast two of these species usually accounting for > 50 % of the total assemblage.\\nSince this benthic foraminiferal assemblage group comprises samples taken from\\neither shallow water depths (<20 m) or sill areas, typically with a coarse substrate (60\\n± 30 % sand), assemblage group B is likely indicative of locations with very high\\nbottom water current activity.\\nAssemblage group C (Bulimina marginata - Nonionella turgida - Stainforthia\\nfusiformis) consists of sediment samples predominantly obtained from the deeps of the\\nmain and outer basin, where the substrate is fine grained (62.5 ± 13.9 % silt),\\nsuggesting a calm depositional environment. Species such as Adercotryman\\nglomeratum and Cassidulina reniforme, along with recorded June BWTs of around\\n11.8 °C, suggests bottom water conditions at these sites are typically cool for long\\nperiods of the year. This, along with the high organic matter content (10.7 ±2.5 %) of\\n351\\nChapter 9 Conclusions and Further work\\nthe fine-grained sediment and high species diversity and equitablity, suggests benthic\\nforaminifera from this assemblage group are living in relatively stable conditions\\nunder a strongly stratified water column.\\nAssemblage group D (A. beccarii - C. lobatulus - S. wrightii - E. excavatum)\\nencompasses outer basin and main basin samples from water depths of 31- 121 m\\nand from BWS and BWT of 33.6-34.2 and 11.6-12.5 °C, respectively. Fairly high\\nabundances of C. lobatulus, A. beccarii and S. wrightii in these moderately coarse\\nsediments (50 % sand), with low abundances of \\'calm depositional\\' taxa such as B.\\nmarginata and N. turgida, suggest that locations yielding these assemblages\\nexperience either mild current activity or episodic current activity, as seen during\\nDWREs. The increasing abundance of porcelaneous taxa towards the outer basin\\nsuggests abundances of foraminifera with this wall structure could be used as a BWS\\nindicator.\\nDetailed data and discussion can be found in chapter 5.\\n9.1.5 What influences the modern stable carbon isotopic compositions of benthic\\nforaminifera in Loch Sunart?\\nThe stable isotopic compositions of four benthic foraminifera species; Ammonia\\nbeccarii, Bulimina marginata, Nonionella turgida and Cibicides lobatulus were\\nmeasured and compared to environmental data collected at the sampling site. The\\nstable isotopic compositions were used to indicate relative living depths for each\\n1 T\\nspecies, with C. lobatulus exhibiting 5 C values typical of an epifaunal habitat and\\nthus likely recording the 813C of seawater dissolved inorganic carbon. The 813C of the\\nother species pointed to infaunal living habitats with B. marginata appearing to\\noccupy a shallow infaunal habitat, A. beccarii living at an intermediate infaunal depth\\n1 3\\nand N. turgida yielding the most depleted 8 C, suggesting a deep infaunal habitat.\\nThe difference between 8 ^abiddes lobatulus £ind 8 turgida was used to estimate a\\npore water S13C gradient of ~ 3 %c, which is steeper than the majority of deep-sea\\nopen ocean sites but comparable to sites from the western North Atlantic with similar\\nbottom water compositions and shallow oxygen penetration (McCorkle & Emerson,\\n1988).\\n352\\nChapter 9 Conclusions and Further work\\nStable oxygen isotopic compositions from A. beccarii, B. marginata, and C. lobatulus\\npoint to a possible \\'seasonal effect\\' in benthic foraminiferal isotopic compositions\\nfrom shelf seas with a strong seasonal heating cycle, though N. turgida appears to\\ncalcify close to 5lsO of seawater throughout the year. Comparison of measured S180\\nwith theoretical equilibrium SlsO calcite, calculated using bottom water temperature\\n(BWT) and bottom water salinity (BWS) recorded at the time of collection, suggests\\nC. lobatulus, A. beccarii and B. marginata in Loch Sunart calcify during peak BWT in\\nOctober/November/December; trends seen in other shelf sea areas (Scourse et al.,\\n2004, pers. comm., Dr. Gaute Mikalesen, 2004).\\nDetailed data and discussion can be found in chapter 6.\\n9.1.6 Does the benthic foraminifera Cibicides lobatulus calcify close to the\\n• • • • 1R •\\ntheoretical equilibrium S O calcite ofseawater?\\nMeasured 8lsO from A. beccarii, B. marginata, N. turgida and C. lobatulus was\\ncompared to the SI80 of equilibrium calcite to determine the degree of isotopic\\n1 o\\ndisequilibrium for each species (A8 O), with the focus being on C. lobatulus, since\\nthis species was used to obtain the stratigraphic records of S180 from Loch Sunart\\ncores GC023 and SC023. Many studies have reported Cibicidoides spp. calcifying\\n1 O 1 o\\nwith pronounced 8 O disequilibria (e.g. Celtic Sea AS Ocmcides lobatulus = -0.92 ± 0.56\\n%c; Scourse et al., 2004 ) whilst infaunal taxa, such as Uvigerina (Shackleton, 1974)\\nor A. beccarii (Scourse et al., 2004), typically calcify close to isotopic equilibrium.\\nHowever, Loch Sunart C. lobatulus appears to calcify close to oxygen isotopic\\nequilibrium (A8lsO = -0.11 ± 0.17 %c) when the Bemis et al., (1998) or Lynch-\\nStieglitz et al., (1999) palaeotemperature equations (equations calibrated with the\\nepifaunal Cibicidoides group), are applied to the data. The disparity between the\\nsmall C. lobatulus ASlsO presented here and the large A8lsO disequilibria of\\nCibicidoides reported in other studies, highlights the importance of establishing which\\npalaoetemperature equation to use for a benthic foraminiferal species. It is\\n1 8\\nrecommended that a 8 Oitemperature equation calibrated to the epifaunal group\\n1 8\\nCibicidoides is used to derive palaeotemperature from measured C. lobatulus 8 O\\ndata.\\n353\\nChapter 9 Conclusions and Further work\\nThe implication of negligible inter-annual salinity variations in the main basin of Loch\\nSunart, along with the report of minor salinity influences on the 5180 of Loch Etive\\nwater (Austin & Inall, 2002) suggests the main basin of Loch Sunart may provide an\\nideal location for resolving high resolution palaeotemperature records from fossil\\nbenthic foraminiferal S180 calcite. The 0.62 %c inter-annual range in C. lobatulus\\n6180 from core SC023 requires a BWS change of ~ 3, and since a BWS change of this\\nmagnitude in Loch Sunart is extremely unlikely to occur, C. lobatulus 8lsO does not\\nsolely reflect BWS in Loch Sunart. The same 0.62 %c variation requires a BWT\\nchange of ~ 2.4 °C and since the inter-annual summer sea surface temperature at\\nMillport varies by ~ 2.66 °C (between 1953-2000), the 8lsO C. lobatulus is assumed\\nto reflect changes in BWT.\\nDetailed data and discussion can be found in chapter 6.\\n9.2 Conclusions to Palaeoenvironmental reconstructions\\n9.2.1 Can an independent proxy of palaeotemperature from Loch Sunart be\\ngenerated using a benthic foraminiferal transferfunction model ?\\nThe Recent Benthic Foraminifera (RBF) training set of Sejrup et al., (2004, n = 260)\\nwas modified by adding 3 modem benthic foraminifera assemblages (22, 80 and 198)\\nfrom the main and outer basin of Loch Sunart. This extended the summer (July-\\nAugust-September) BWT environmental gradient from 11.99 °C to 12.51 °C\\n(increasing mean summer BWT from 5.57 °C to 5.62 °C) and shifted the mean\\nsummer BWS environmental gradient (already at 33.58) from 34.95 to 34.94.\\nA weighted-averaging partial least squares (WA-PLS), 3 component transfer function\\nmodel (Ts3) was created for summer (July-August-Setpember) BWT using a training\\nset of n = 253 (including the 3 Loch Sunart samples). A \\'leave-one-out\\' validation of\\nthe model yielded a root mean square error of prediction (RMSEPjack) of 1.03 °C; a\\n0.03 °C improvement on the 1.06 °C RMSEPjackof Sejrup et al., (2004). Comparison\\nof the reconstructed summer BWT (RBWT) from SC023 benthic foraminiferal\\nassemblages with the observed May-October Millport sea surface temperature series\\n354\\nChapter 9 Conclusions and Further work\\nbetween 1986-2000, demonstrated that inter-annual trends in RBWT from the main\\nbasin of Loch Sunart agree well with trends in the Millport series. The Ts3 model\\nRBWT ranged between 9 - 10.1 °C whereas Millport sea surface temperatures range\\nfrom 12.4 - 14.8 °C; this difference probably reflects the \\'dampened\\' and lagged\\nresponse of deep waters to the seasonal heating cycle. Given the strong relationship\\nbetween reconstructed NW Scottish marine temperatures, air temperatures and the\\nNAO (chapter 3) along with the reported oceanic response to climate forcing (e.g.\\nHolliday, 2003), Loch Sunart palaeoproxies derived from benthic foraminifera are\\nlikely to reflect the climate of the NE Atlantic region.\\nA 3 component, jack-knifed WA-PLS transfer function model for summer (July-\\nAugust-September) BWS (Ssl) yielded an RMSEPjack of 0.17; identical to the 2\\ncomponent, jack-knifed WA-PLS transfer function model of Sejrup et al., (2004).\\nThe model gave SC023 reconstructed summer BWS (RBWS) ranging from 33.99 to\\n34.22. Observed BWS at the Loch Sunart core site is typically ~ 33.6, suggesting Ssl\\nover-estimates BWS by ~ 0.4 - 0.8 at the Loch Sunart core site and this may be due to\\nthe under-representation of benthic foraminiferal assemblages with similar recorded\\nBWS in the RBF. Unfortunately, the RBWS could not be calibrated with regional\\nsalinity series because these do not exist. However, the 813C from the epifaunal\\nspecies C. lobatulus, often used as a proxy for BWS changes, suggests isotopically\\n1\\ndepleted 5 C typically occurs with fresher salinities. Additionally, the trend towards\\ndecreasing salinity towards the core top of SC023 is consistent with reports of\\nfreshening in the N Atlantic region and could reflect the influence of the prolonged\\npositive NAO phase (e.g. Blindheim et al., 2000).\\nDetailed data and discussion can be found in chapter 7.\\n9.2.2 Can high resolution palaeoenvironmental reconstructions be obtained from\\nLoch Sunart sedimentary archives?\\nA preliminary radiocarbon date close to the base of the ~ 3 m gravity core GC023,\\nobtained from the Dun Ghallain Deep, in the main basin of Loch Sunart, initially\\nsuggested a core resolution of ~ 7 years.cm\"1. However, the combined 14C and lead-\\ncaesium age model for GC023 suggests a large hiatus of around 1000 years. This\\n355\\nChapter 9 Conclusions and Further work\\nhiatus occurred sometime between ~ AD 900 and AD 1900, negating the\\ninterpretation of paleonvironmental conditions through the Medieval Warm Period\\nand Little Ice Age. The large increase in grain size during this period, points to the\\npossibility of winnowing or scouring of sediment at this site, which is likely due to\\nstrong bottom water current activity influenced by the steep narrow bathymetry\\nseaward of the core site. This hypothesis of winnowing is supported by a seismic\\nprofile from a nearby main basin deep which reveals a thin Holocene sediment\\npackage in the deep (111 m) and a thick package on the fairly shallow (~ 50 m) flat\\nshelf region, and exemplifies the need to carry out a reconnaissance survey of sites\\nprior to coring to ensure that a continuous high resolution sedimentary archive is\\nrecovered.\\nCarefully evaluated age-control data highlight the problematic geochronology for core\\nGC023 and along with it\\'s relatively short time span, negates the identification of\\nmillennial scale climate cycles often seen in recent late Holocene records. The age-\\nmodel also makes it impossible to resolve climate and environmental change during\\nthe Medieval Warm Period and Little Ice Age, and inhibits the interpretation of the\\ndevelopment of the fjordic circulation change continuously through the last 2000\\nyears. Despite this geochronology problem, palaeoenvironmental reconstructions\\nfrom Loch Sunart suggest that these high resolution sedimentary archives have the\\npotential to resolve inter-annual marine climate variability and capture an integrated\\nrecord of changes in the catchment and marine environment.\\nVarious proxies (such as the redox boundary and C. lobatulus 813C) point to a change\\nin fjordic circulation around AD 500, with a shift to increased coast water influence at\\nthe core site. The cause of circulation change is not clear, but possibilities include a\\nthreshold change in fjordic circulation due to isostatic sea level fall or changes in open\\nN Atlantic conditions.\\n1 o\\nComparison of the C. lobatulus 5 O record with a long reconstructed marine\\ntemperature series demonstrates that the test chemistry of C. lobatulus from the main\\nbasin records inter-annual variations in bottom water temperature of a similar\\n1 8\\nmagnitude to instrumental data (i.e. ~ 2 °C). The agreement of C. lobatulus 8 O and\\nRBWT suggests BWT at the site were cooler and BWS were higher during the 20th\\n356\\nChapter 9 Conclusions and Further work\\ncentury warm period and possibly during the Roman Warm Period, and this is likely\\nto be due to increased stratification and enhanced estuarine circulation at this time. A\\n\\'spike\\' of enriched 5lsO around AD 500 (0.5 %c heavier than other 5lsO from that core\\nsection) equates to a temperature change of ~ 2.3 °C; similar to the RBWT cooling of\\n1.7 °C at the same level. Two major events occur around AD 500; an IRD event in\\nthe North Atlantic and the \\'nuclear winter\\' of AD 535 and though problematic age\\ncontrol makes it impossible to attribute causal factors to shifts in palaeoenvironmental\\nconditions in GC023, such \\'extreme\\' and isolated events likely exemplify the\\nsensitivity and rapid response of palaeoproxies in the Loch Sunart main basin.\\nThe high frequency and large amplitude shifts in C. lobatulus isotopic compositions\\nfrom GC023 exemplifies the sensitivity of these marginal environments to regional\\ncirculation and N Atlantic climate forcing mechanisms and illustrates the potential to\\nresolve inter-annual marine climate variability and capture changes in the catchment\\nenvironment or climate.\\nDetailed data and discussion can be found in chapter 8.\\n9.3. Furtherwork\\nThe preliminary work presented in this thesis has established the potential to resolve\\ninter-annual climatic variability from sedimentary archives from Loch Sunart and\\nhighlighted the following areas for further work which will hopefully improve the\\nunderstanding of processes influencing palaeoenvironmental proxies in Loch Sunart\\nand achieve more accurate palaeoenvironmental reconstructions from these newly\\nexploited environments:\\nChapter 3: Presently, the model used for investigating the climatically forced\\ncirculation of Loch Sunart (Elliott et al., 1992; Gillibrand et al., 1995;\\nGillibrand et al., 2005) only models salinity. However, bottom water\\ntemperature variability may also accompany deep water renewal events\\nand this would have implications for palaeoclimatic reconstructions\\nutilising 5180 of foraminiferal calcite (Austin & Inall, 2002). Proposals\\n357\\nChapter 9 Conclusions and Further work\\nhave been implemented to extend this modelling work to include\\ntemperature as a model output (pers. comm., Dr. P Gillibrand, 2004).\\nChapter 4: Sample material from a marine bivalve Arctica islandica obtained from\\nLoch Creran in 1969 by Professor John Gage (Dunstaffnage Marine\\nLaboratories, Oban) and since stored at the Scottish Natural History\\nMuseum, has been submitted to NERC East Kilbride AMS Laboratory for\\nradiocarbon AMS dating (allocation number 941.1001). Unfortunately, the\\n14C data were not available at the time of submission.\\nThe shell was alive at the time of collection and scelerochronological\\nmethods suggests that the shell was approximately 90 years old, hence\\nspawned around AD 1878. It is hoped that 14C data from this A. islandica\\nwill provide a record of the AR changes over the lifetime of the shell,\\nwhich are likely to be influenced by climatic variability such as the NAO\\n(e.g. Druffell 1997; Gillibrand et al., 2005) and use bomb produced 14C\\ndetected in the shell material as a tracer to investigate the circulation of\\nLoch Creran (e.g. Weidman & Jones, 1993).\\nFuture research cruises in Loch Sunart will continue to try and obtain \\'live\\'\\nA. islandia.\\nChapter 5:The typical fjordic bathymetry of Loch Sunart (i.e. deep basins and\\nshallow sills) presents two potential areas for future palaeoclimatic\\nresearch. Fossil benthic foraminifera from the calm depositional\\nenvironment of the main basin deep appear to document inter-annual\\nbottom water temperature changes (in both assemblage structure and test\\ngeochemistry), whilst the inner basin, with it\\'s restricted connection to\\ncoastal water and strong response to freshwater inputs (chapter 3) has the\\npotential to provide records of atmospheric climatic forcing through fossil\\nassemblages. Benthic foraminiferal analyses on long sediment cores\\n358\\nChapter 9 Conclusions and Further work\\nrecovered from both the main basin and the inner basin (between 2001 to\\n2004), could provide an insight into the environmental gradient of the loch.\\nChapter 6: There is a paucity of stable isotope data from NE Atlantic shelf sea benthic\\nforaminifera (Austin et al., in progress), and more empirical data is\\nrequired from living benthic foraminifera from these environments in order\\nto better understand the \\'seasonal effect\\' and controls on test geochemistry,\\nfor example, how changes in porewater geochemistry, such as pH, affect\\nthe 8180 of infaunal benthic foraminifera.\\nRelationships between the 813C of epifaunal and deep infaunal taxa and\\nvariables such as water depth and substrate organic matter point to possible\\nproxies for past bottom water dissolved oxygen concentrations and\\n1\\npalaeoproductivity. The small sample number of paired 8 C data\\npresented here probably explains the marginally insignificant relationships\\nand the addition of more S13C data is likely to improve the statistical\\nsignificance of the correlations and possibly strengthen the relationship.\\nChapter 7: This study illustrates that the shelf sea Recent Benthic Foraminifera\\ntraining set (plus 3 Loch Sunart samples) of Sejrup et al., (2004) can be\\nused to create a WA-PLS transfer function model that reconstructs a\\nsummer bottom water temperature series which is independent of 8lsO\\nderived temperature and agrees well with an observed marine temperature\\nseries, even when the fossil samples are at the extreme of the\\nenvironmental gradient. The training set could be extended to include\\nmore samples from sites on the west coast of the UK which are directly\\ninfluenced by the North Eastern Atlantic circulation but have a more\\nsoutherly location thus lengthening the temperature gradient. Samples\\nfrom other sea lochs which display a lower basin salinity but have deep\\nsills and thus are not \\'restricted\\' basins could be included to provide\\nregionally representative samples and extend the lower limit of the BWS\\ngradient. Extended quantitative palaeoenvironmental reconstruction work\\n359\\nChapter 9 Conclusions and Further work\\non core SC023 may provide more information on the relationship between\\nreconstructed summer bottom water temperature and stable isotopic\\ncompositions.\\nChapter 8: Palaeoenvironmental reconstructions from GC023 clearly illustrate the\\npotential of obtaining high-resolution marine sedimentary archives from\\nthese marginal marine environments. These records are likely to resolve\\ninter-annual marine climate variability and capture changes in the\\ncatchment environment or climate, thus providing an opportunity to study\\nland-ocean interactions.\\nFollowing a seismic survey, a 20 m long core (MD04-2831) from a\\nshallow shelf area, near to the site of core GC023 the Loch Sunart basin\\nwas recovered during a recent (2004) R.V. Marion Dusfresne cruise and\\npreliminary range finder radiocarbon dates suggests an age of 1,956 ±19\\n14C yrs BP (i.e. uncalibrated and uncorrected for AR) at 470 cm. Future\\nwork plans to document the palaeoproxies in this core in order to\\nreconstruct the palaeoenvironmental conditions in the main basin of Loch\\nSunart, during the past 1000 years (the EU project MILLENIUM) and also\\npossibly since the de-glacial period. This will hopefully provide new\\ninsights into the evolution of sea loch circulation throughout the Holocene.\\n360\\nReferences\\nReferences\\nAarseth, I., 1997.

Scotland</dc:title><dc:creator>\\nCage, Alix Gayle</dc:creator><dc:contributor>\\nAustin, W. E. N. (William E. N.)</dc:contributor><dc:contributor>\\nUniversity of St Andrews</dc:contributor><dc:contributor>\\nScottish International Education Trust</dc:contributor><dc:contributor>\\nRussell Trust</dc:contributor><dc:description>\\nThe first study to exploit the sedimentary archives of Loch Sunart, a relatively well-flushed fjord on the NW coast of Scotland, for palaeoenvironmental reconstruction is presented. In order to understand environmental influences on past environments, the\\r\\nmodern physical, chemical and biological conditions of the loch and surrounding\\r\\ncatchment were studied. Both observational and computer modelled annual inner basin\\r\\nsalinity show a clear response to climatic forcing, modulated by NAO behaviour. Main\\r\\nbasin salinity appears to remain very stable and a well-defined salinity: δ¹⁸O relationship\\r\\nsuggests excellent potential for palaeotemperature reconstructions based on foraminiferal δ¹⁸O\\r\\n.\\r\\nMulti-variate statistical analyses identified 4 benthic foraminiferal assemblage groups in\\r\\nthe surface sediments of the loch: A) restricted basin (E. scaber); B) very high current\\r\\nactivity (C. lobatulus-A. mammilla -A. beccarii); C) calm environment undera stratified\\r\\nwater column (B. marginata-N. turgida-S. fusiformis) and D) coastal water influence and\\r\\nmild/episodic current activity (A. beccarii-C. lobatulus-S. wrightii-E. excavatum). Using\\r\\nassemblage data, an existing benthic foraminiferal transfer function was modified in\\r\\norder to reconstruct Loch Sunart bottom water temperature (BWS); these reconstructions\\r\\nagree well with Scottish coastal temperature series (Millport).\\r\\n\\r\\nC. lobatulus appears to calcify close to theoretical equilibrium δ¹⁸O calcite (Δδ¹⁸O = -0.11 ± 0.17 %), probably during the warm bottom water temperatures (BWT) of late\\r\\nautumn, and predominantly reflects changes in BWT rather than BWS in the main basin\\r\\nof Loch Sunart.\\r\\nThe first late Holocene high resolution palaeoenvironmental reconstruction from the deep\\r\\n(121 m) main basin of Loch Sunart is presented; gravity core (GC023) is 3 m long and\\r\\nspans the last 2,000 years. Despite difficulties with geochronology, palaeoenvironmental\\r\\nreconstructions from Loch Sunart suggest that these high resolution sedimentary archives\\r\\nhave the potential to resolve inter-annual marine climate variability of the order of 1-2°C\\r\\nand capture an integrated record of changes in the catchment and marine environment.</dc:description><dc:date>\\n2006-06-22</dc:date><dc:date>\\n2018-08-30T13:59:48Z</dc:date><dc:date>\\n2018-08-30T13:59:48Z</dc:date><dc:type>\\nThesis</dc:type><dc:type>\\nDoctoral</dc:type><dc:type>\\nPhD Doctor of Philosophy</dc:type><dc:identifier>\\nhttp://hdl.handle.net/10023/15910</dc:identifier><dc:language>\\nen</dc:language><dc:format>\\napplication/pdf</dc:format><dc:format>\\napplication/zip</dc:format><dc:coverage>\\nxviii, 398, [10] p.</dc:coverage><dc:publisher>\\nUniversity of St Andrews</dc:publisher><dc:publisher>\\nThe University of St Andrews</dc:publisher>\\n</oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>',\n",

A typical egg farm contains anywhere from 100,000 to 1 million hens, with each hen \\nhoused in a metal wire cage with four or five other birds. These production systems have been \\ncriticized by animal advocacy groups for several reasons: the tight space requirements (about \\n67 square inches of space per hen) prohibit chickens from fully extending their wings, and \\nhens are unable to exhibit natural behaviors such as dust bathing and laying eggs in nests. \\nThese concerns recently received widespread public attention when the Humane Society of \\nthe United States (HSUS), working with several other advocacy groups, introduced a ballot \\ninitiative to ban battery cage egg production in the state of California. The proposition, \\nformally known as the Prevention of Farm Animal Cruelty Act, passed in November 2008, \\nwith 63.5% of Californians voting in favor. The effects of the ban in California have been \\nintensely debated, and one of the key unanswered questions is the potential impact of the ban \\non egg prices. \\n  In addition to policy initiatives, increasing consumer demand for animal welfare, human \\nhealth, and variety has prompted producers to market a diversity of egg offerings. Demand for \\nhealth attributes has resulted in the development of Omega-3 and vitamin-enriched eggs, and \\nlabeling programs facilitated by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the United Egg Producers, \\nand the Animal Welfare Institute have led to cage-free, organic, and free-range egg options. \\nAlthough sales of generic eggs have decreased over the past decade, specialty egg sales have \\n \\n \\n \\nJae Bong Chang is a research fellow at the Korean Rural Economics Institute; Jayson L.

Chang, Lusk, and Norwood  A Hedonic Analysis of Retail Egg Prices   407 \\n \\nsteadily increased, accounting for approximately 16% of total egg sales in 2005. Organic eggs \\nrepresent one of the fastest growing segments in this market; sales grew at an average annual \\nrate of 19% from 2000 to 2005, reaching $161 million in 2005 (Oberholtzer, Green, and \\nLopez, 2006). As a result, the egg market is now highly differentiated, and most grocery \\nstores currently offer eggs differentiated by production method, color, size, brand, and pack- \\naging. \\n  Despite these changes, there is presently little publicly available information on price \\ndifferences between various types of eggs or on consumers’ willingness to pay for animal \\nwelfare and health attributes. To address this issue, we carry out a hedonic analysis using \\nretail scanner data for two regional markets and for the United States as a whole. \\n \\nBackground \\nEgg production is a large and highly concentrated business. Each year, more than 300 million \\nlaying hens produce over 90 billion eggs in the United States. In 2007, five states (Iowa, \\nOhio, Indiana, Pennsylvania, and Texas) produced 40% of eggs. The industry is moderately \\nconcentrated, with 205 egg-producing companies owning 95% of all layers in the United \\nStates (American Egg Board, 2009). \\n  Egg consumption fell dramatically from the 1940s to the 1990s due to concerns about \\nhealth and cholesterol; annual per capita egg consumption peaked at 403 in 1945, and reached \\na low of about 230 in the 1990s (Putnam and Allshouse, 1999). Per capita consumption of \\neggs has subsequently stabilized and was approximately 243 eggs per person per year in 2008 \\n[USDA/Economic Research Service (ERS), 2009]. As consumer demand for eggs has changed \\nand the market has become increasingly differentiated, several studies have investigated \\nconsumer preferences for egg characteristics. These studies relied on surveys to assess \\nCanadian and UK consumer egg preferences. Fearne and Lavelle (1996) found that price and \\nanimal welfare were two key factors driving egg choice for consumers in the United \\nKingdom. Bennett (1997) used data collected from mail surveys to measure UK consumers’ \\nwillingness to pay to support legislation to ban the use of battery cages in egg production; \\nalmost 80% of survey respondents supported the proposed legislation and were willing to \\npay, on average, £0.43 more per dozen given the ban. Asselin (2005) studied Canadian \\nconsumers’ willingness to pay for Omega-3 and vitamin-enhanced eggs, and found people \\nwere willing to pay between $0 and $0.72 more per dozen for Omega-3 eggs, depending on \\ntheir health consciousness. \\n  A few studies have employed observed market data to evaluate consumer egg preferences. \\nBaltzer (2004) used scanner data on weekly sales from a major retail chain in Denmark. He \\nestimated an almost ideal demand system (AIDS) model to determine Danish consumers’ \\nmarginal willingness to pay for five varieties of eggs—battery cage, barn, free-range, organic, \\nand pasteurized eggs—and found consumers were willing to pay significant premiums for \\neggs that improved animal welfare and involved natural production methods. Karipidis et al. \\n(2005) used data obtained from retail stores in two metropolitan areas in Greece during the \\nsummer of 2004. In their hedonic price modeling, 14 egg attributes were clustered into five \\ngroups: natural characteristics, poultry-feeding conditions, packaging, quality-control system, \\nand vertical integration. The authors reported that eggs produced under organic and free-\\nrange feeding systems and Omega-3 enriched eggs have high hedonic prices, but other \\nfeeding conditions did not influence retail prices. Their study, however, included only 175 \\nobservations and a limited set of attribute types and levels.   408   December 2010  Journal of Agricultural and Resource Economics \\n \\n \\nMethods \\nData \\n \\nOur data consist of three sets of point-of-sale scanner data collected from a representative \\nsample of retail outlets by Information Resources, Inc. (IRI).\\n1 Each set contains data on stock \\nkeeping units (SKUs), including information on size, color, package type, brand vs. private \\nlabel, and the number of eggs per package. Moreover, the data set also indicates whether each \\nSKU was advertised as cage-free, cage-free & Omega-3, cage-free & organic, fertile, free-\\nrange, free-range & organic, natural, Omega-3, organic, organic & Omega-3, pasteurized, \\nvegan fed, or generic fresh eggs (i.e., battery cage eggs).\\n2 Color levels of eggs include white \\nand brown, and size levels are small, medium, large, extra large, jumbo, and super jumbo. \\nPackaging was categorized by IRI into eight types: carton, cardboard carton, plastic carton, \\nstyrofoam carton, paper carton, plastic wrapped carton, cardboard box, and other type. \\n  The first data set consists of quarterly egg sales for over 1,985 SKUs across the entire \\nUnited States over the 20 quarters from the beginning of 2004 to the end of 2008. In addition \\nto the U.S. data, we also obtained weekly scanner data for two specific metropolitan areas: \\nDallas/Fort Worth, Texas, and San Francisco/Oakland, California. These data sets span from \\nJanuary 1, 2007 to January 25, 2009, and are in all respects identical to the overall U.S. data \\nset except for data frequency (weekly rather than quarterly) and time period covered (two \\nyears starting in January 2007 vs. four years starting in January 2004). We chose these two \\nspecific locations for several reasons. First, we wanted a California location because of the \\ndebate over the recent California ballot initiative. Second, we wanted a location of a similar \\nsize that was some distance from California (and thus less likely to be susceptible to media \\nexposure on the ballot initiative), and one that we perceived might be less interested in animal \\nwelfare issues.\\n3 In addition, Texas and California rank fifth and sixth among egg-producing \\nstates in number of eggs produced. \\n  Table 1 reports the percentage of SKUs possessing the various attributes considered in this \\nanalysis. About 85% are generic fresh eggs (either conventional fresh or with no production \\nmethod indicated), while the number of SKUs advertised as organic represents only 5.28% of \\nthe total. Another 1.22\\n +\\n 0.05\\n +\\n 0.58\\n =\\n 1.85% of SKUs advertised organic in addition to \\nanother attribute such as cage-free, free-range, or Omega-3. Approximately 70% of egg SKUs \\nare white. Most SKUs are large-sized eggs (53%) and sold by the dozen (65%). A larger \\npercentage of the SKUs in San Francisco are cage-free and organic than is the case in \\nDallas. Likewise, a larger percentage of SKUs are brown vs. white eggs in San Francisco as \\ncompared to Dallas. About 33% of the SKUs in Dallas are associated with package sizes \\nincluding 13 or more eggs, but only about 20% of SKUs in San Francisco include this many \\neggs.  \\n                                                 \\n1 IRI records weekly data from 34,000 supermarkets, drug stores, mass merchandisers, and convenience channels across the \\nUnited States. The U.S. data set contains information on approximately 108 billion egg sales from 2004 to 2008. USDA/ERS \\n(2009) data indicate that about 258 billion shell eggs were produced during this time period. Therefore, our data set covers \\napproximately 42% of all U.S. shell egg production from 2004 to 2008. \\n2 The data set also included sales of cooked, cultured, hard-boiled, and homogenized eggs. We excluded these types of eggs in \\nour analysis. We also removed SKUs from the data set in which package sizes were only one egg per package because the per egg \\nprice of such SKUs was often an order of magnitude higher than the mean. \\n3 See Lusk (2010) for an analysis of how demand for cage-free and organic eggs differed and changed over time in these two \\nlocations. Note also that the Humane Society of the United States (2010) recently released a comprehensive report, “Humane State \\nRanking,” rating all 50 states on a wide range of animal protection laws dealing with pets, animal cruelty and fighting, wildlife, \\nanimals in research, and farm animals.

To provide a feel for differences in sales \\nvolume across different production systems, we used the scanner data to calculate the quantity- \\nshare of eggs sold using each production method by location (table 2). In the United States, \\nalmost 95% of eggs sold are conventional fresh or generic eggs (eggs with “none indicated” \\nfor production method are almost certainly cage eggs). While about 5.28% of SKUs are \\norganic, only about 1% of egg sales are organic. \\n  Table 2 also reveals regional differences. Of all eggs sold in San Francisco, 4.43% and \\n2.29% are organic and cage-free, respectively. Dallas consumers bought fewer organic and \\ncage-free eggs—only 0.41% and 0.50%, respectively. Overall, “specialty” eggs account for \\nabout 30% of total SKUs in San Francisco and 17% of SKUs in Dallas, but only about 13% \\nand 3% of total eggs sold in San Francisco and Dallas. The small market shares do not \\nnecessarily imply a small volume of egg sales. The last row of table 2 shows that almost a \\nbillion eggs were sold in the Dallas/Ft. Worth stores over the two-year time period, and the \\naverage weekly volume of “specialty” egg sales was about 886,000 eggs per week in San \\nFrancisco and 270,000 eggs per week in Dallas. \\n  For each SKU, we calculate the average price paid in each time period (each quarter for the \\nU.S. data and each week for the regional data sets). Egg prices are deflated by the Consumer \\nPrice Index (2008  =  100). Because SKUs differ in the number of eggs per package, we \\ncalculate prices on a per egg basis. Figure 1 illustrates the trend in U.S. egg prices ($/egg) for \\nthree different production methods: conventional, cage-free, and organic. The price premium \\nfor organic over conventional fresh eggs ranged from $0.16/egg in the first quarter of 2008 to \\n$0.21/egg during 2005. The average price premium for organic eggs over the entire period \\nwas about $0.20/egg. The average price premium for cage-free over conventional eggs wasChang, Lusk, and Norwood  A Hedonic Analysis of Retail Egg Prices   411 \\n \\n     \\nFigure 1. Average U.S. egg price ($/egg) over time by production method \\n \\nabout $0.12/egg over the time period and reached a minimum of $0.08/egg during early 2008, \\nwhen conventional egg prices rose sharply. The price trends shown in figure 1 are calculated \\nbased on the raw data (adjusted for inflation) and do not account for differences that are often \\ncorrelated with organic eggs. For example, organic eggs tend to be brown and tend to be sold \\nin smaller package sizes (although this is not exclusively true), whereas conventional fresh \\neggs tend to be white and sold by the dozen. Thus, the raw price premia for organic vs. \\nconventional ($0.20/egg) is attributable to a variety of factors other than “organic,” a fact high- \\nlighting the need for hedonic regression analysis to calculate ceteris paribus effects. \\n  Table 3 reports descriptive statistics for egg prices. The data reveal that prices tend to be \\nhigher in San Francisco as compared to Dallas or the rest of the country as a whole. For \\nexample, the average price of conventional fresh eggs was $0.26/egg in San Francisco but \\nonly $0.14/egg in Dallas. Many conditions contribute to the price difference between the two \\nlocations. In particular, the overall cost of living and average wage rates are higher in San \\nFrancisco than in Dallas. Differences in the costs of egg production and transportation are \\nalso relevant. Somewhat surprisingly, the premiums for organic and cage-free eggs over \\nconventional eggs were lower in San Francisco ($0.13/egg and $0.06/egg, respectively) \\ncompared to Dallas ($0.20/egg and $0.12/egg, respectively) or the rest of the country ($0.20/ \\negg and $0.12/egg, respectively). \\n \\nThe Hedonic Price Model \\nThe primary objective of this paper is to estimate a descriptive model of egg prices to \\ndetermine how egg prices differ by product characteristics such as organic and cage-free. We \\nused the standard hedonic modeling approach to accomplish this task. The hedonic method \\nrelies on observing differences in market prices to infer the value or implicit price \\nof underlying characteristics.

Prices are deflated by the \\nconsumer price index (2008 = 100). \\n \\nformalized in Rosen’s (1974) seminal study showing how the “1\\nst stage” hedonic price \\nfunction could be derived via the interaction of consumer demand for and producer supply of \\nproduct characteristics. The “1\\nst stage” hedonic price functions we estimate show how egg \\nprices in equilibrium vary with egg characteristics, which relate to a point on the marginal \\nwillingness-to-pay schedule. However, implicit prices do not reveal a full willingness-to-pay \\nor demand schedule because the marginal implicit price is also determined by the producers’ \\noffer curve, which varies with the costs of providing different characteristics. Differences in \\ncost across location or difference in demand can therefore explain differences in estimated \\nimplicit prices. Recent studies (e.g., Bajari and Benkard, 2005) have questioned the appropri-\\nateness of some of the assumptions of Rosen’s model—such as the assumption of perfect \\ncompetition, separability of attributes, and continuous product space—insofar as they allow \\nthe analyst to identify consumers’ preferences for the underlying product characteristics. \\n  If we make the standard assumption that any unobservables are uncorrelated with the \\nobserved product characteristics, the empirical model can be written as:   Chang, Lusk, and Norwood  A Hedonic Analysis of Retail Egg Prices   413 \\n \\n(1)         \\n13 2 6\\n0 12 3\\n11 1\\n8\\n45 6\\n1\\n11\\n2\\n7 8\\n1\\nln( )\\n(# / )\\n(# / ) ,\\njj j\\nit ij ij ij\\njj j\\nj\\nii j i\\nj\\nj\\nii j i t\\nj\\nPrice ProductionMethod Color Size\\nPrivateLabel Package Eggs Package\\nEggs Package Month\\n\\uf03d\\uf03d \\uf03d\\n\\uf03d\\n\\uf03d\\n\\uf03d\\uf062 \\uf02b \\uf062 \\uf02b \\uf062 \\uf02b \\uf062\\n\\uf02b\\uf062 \\uf02b \\uf062 \\uf02b\\uf062\\n\\uf02b\\uf062 \\uf02b \\uf062 \\uf02b\\uf065\\n\\uf0e5\\uf0e5 \\uf0e5\\n\\uf0e5\\n\\uf0e5\\n \\nwhere Priceit is the average price ($/egg) for SKU i in time period t, the β’s are parameters to \\nbe estimated, \\uf065it is a stochastic error term, and the remaining variables are dummy variables \\nidentifying the attributes shown in table 1, except for the variable #Eggs/Package, which is a \\ncontinuous variable indicating the number of eggs per package. As previously mentioned, the \\nU.S. data set consists of quarterly observations, and the two regional markets consist of weekly \\nobservations, so monthly dummy variables in equation (1) are replaced with three quarterly \\ndummy variables when analyzing the national data set. \\n  Potential options for functional forms are restricted given the large number of dummy vari-\\nables in our model (McConnell and Strand, 2000; Oczkowski, 1994). As shown in equation \\n(1), we chose the semi-log model over the linear model based on the results from Box-Cox \\nspecification tests and based on previous literature arguing that errors in the semi-log model \\nare relatively more homoskedastic compared to errors in the linear model (Diewert, 2003). \\nWhen dummy variables are included in a semi-log model, the resulting coefficients are not \\nequal to percentage changes (Halvorsen and Palmquist, 1980). For the estimated coefficient \\ncorresponding to a dummy variable, such as \\n1\\n1, \\uf062\\n the percentage effect on price is \\n1\\n1 100( 1 e\\n\\uf062 \\uf02d ). \\nMoreover, given the natural log of the dependent variable, the predicted price is not a simple \\nsum of the variables multiplied by the coefficients. Equation (1) can be rewritten succinctly as \\nln(Priceit) = βXit + \\uf065it, where β is a vector of coefficients and Xit is a conformable vector of \\nexplanatory variables. The expected price is \\n2 0.5 E[ ] , it Price e \\uf02b \\uf073 \\uf03d βX where \\uf073\\n2 is the variance of \\nthe error term. Thus, the predicted implicit price for a product with characteristics X1 rather \\nthan X0 is: \\n2 2\\n0 1 0.5 0.5 . ee \\uf02b\\uf073 \\uf02b\\uf073 \\uf02d βX βX  \\n \\nResults \\nEstimates of the semi-log hedonic price models are shown in table 4. Test results suggest the \\npresence of heteroskedasticity; consequently, we report White’s heteroskedasticity-consistent \\nstandard errors.\\n4 The models fit the data well, explaining 50%, 70%, and 66% of the egg price \\nvariation in the United States, San Francisco/Oakland, and Dallas/Fort Worth markets, \\nrespectively. \\n  As a first step in the analysis, we sought to determine whether the implicit prices were \\nidentical across locations. To investigate this issue, a pooled model (or restricted model) \\nwas estimated; data from all locations were combined and parameters were constrained to  \\n                                                 \\n4 Because of the nature of egg products, some variables are correlated. For example, production method and the color of eggs \\nwere highly collinear (but not perfectly so) due to the fact that different egg-laying breeds tend to be used for specialty egg \\nproduction. To address this issue, we estimated the hedonic model sequentially, beginning with the simplest model with production \\nmethod only, and then estimation of the more complicated model with additional attribute variables. F-tests were carried out to test \\nfor the significance of additional variables; results show all additional sets of variables are significant. Moreover, statistical tests do \\nnot support dropping the variables related to egg color from the regression, and the estimates related to production method are not \\nparticularly sensitive to inclusion of the color variables. 414   December 2010  Journal of Agricultural and Resource Economics \\n \\n \\nTable 4.

There are many valid reasons to suspect the estimates \\nmay differ by location, and this intuition is borne out by statistical tests. \\n  Given the rejection of the hypothesis that data from San Francisco and Dallas can be \\npooled into a single hedonic price function, one might question the validity of the hedonic \\nmodel fit to the aggregate U.S. data (i.e., the first column of results in table 4). We report a \\nhedonic price function for the entire U.S. market because it is of interest to policy makers and \\nproducers. The U.S. hedonic price function provides information on, for example, the differ-\\nence in average price of cage-free vs. cage eggs in the United States, which is a statistic of \\ninterest to many individuals. We interpret the U.S. model estimates as providing descriptive \\nstatistics on the average prices of different types of eggs. It is important to note that the \\nhedonic estimates from a U.S. model will not necessarily equal egg price difference in any \\nparticular location or market; moreover, the U.S. hedonic coefficients are not equal to the \\naverage hedonic coefficients across all locations. \\n  Looking first at the U.S. market results (based on N = 28,701 quarterly price observations \\nfrom 1,985 SKUs observed over five years), table 4 shows that most estimated parameters \\nare statistically significant at the 0.05 level or lower. The coefficient corresponding to cage-\\nfree is 0.449, which implies that the U.S. average price premium for cage-free eggs is \\n100\\n \\uf02a\\n [exp\\n (0.449) − 1] = 56.7% as compared to conventional egg prices. The U.S. average \\nprice premium for cage-free eggs (56.7%) over conventional eggs is less than that for free-\\nrange eggs (87.57%). Hens laying eggs labeled as both cage-free and free-range are kept \\nuncaged in barns, but typically only free-range hens have access to the outdoors. It should be \\nnoted that federal standards for organic labeling require that hens be given outdoor access, \\nand thus organic could also be considered free-range. \\n  The Omega-3 coefficient for the overall U.S. model is 0.493, indicating an average price \\npremium of 63.7% for eggs advertised to have this health benefit. In the U.S. market, organic \\n                                                 \\n5 The Dallas and San Francisco data represent such a small fraction of the overall U.S. data that any “double counting” in the \\npooled model is quite minimal. In the first quarter of 2007, less than 4% of all U.S. egg sales in our data set are in the Dallas and \\nSan Francisco markets. Chang, Lusk, and Norwood  A Hedonic Analysis of Retail Egg Prices   417 \\n \\neggs receive about an 85% premium over conventional eggs. Bundling the attributes of \\nOmega-3 and organic generates a price premium of approximately 103%. \\n  The average U.S. price premium for brown eggs is about 26% compared to white eggs. \\nDifferences in egg color stem from differences in breeds of hens laying the eggs. Although \\nshell color is unrelated to quality, nutrition, or taste, some people may perceive brown eggs as \\nhealthier or of better quality than white ones. Because most cage-free and organic eggs are \\nbrown, this suggests a significant portion of the observed price premium for these production \\nmethods over conventional eggs in the market is likely attributable to color. One of the \\nreasons brown hens (and thus brown eggs) are used in cage-free and organic production \\nsystems is that they are genetically predisposed to act more amicably toward other hens in the \\nopen barn environment than the traditional breeds of white hens used in the cage system. \\nHowever, they also tend to be less productive. These productivity differences result in higher \\nproduction costs for brown eggs, which might also explain the higher price premium for \\nbrown eggs over white. \\n  Results in table 4 also show how egg prices vary with other egg attributes such as egg size, \\npackaging material, branding, and package size. The results indicate that larger eggs generally \\nreceive price premiums relative to smaller eggs. Prices are also influenced by packaging \\nmaterial; eggs packaged in the most common types such as carton and styrofoam cartons tend \\nto be lower priced than those in other package types. The lowest-priced packaging materials \\nare the styrofoam carton and the cardboard box. Private-labeled eggs are priced about the \\nsame as brand-labeled eggs, holding constant other egg characteristics. As the number of eggs \\nper package increases, the results show that the SKU price falls at a decreasing rate, perhaps \\nsuggesting volume discounting. \\n  The last two columns in table 4 report the hedonic estimate models for the San Francisco \\nand Dallas regional egg markets. Results reveal that most explanatory variables are statis-\\ntically significant. The magnitudes of coefficients suggest Dallas is more similar to the United \\nStates than it is to San Francisco. Surprisingly, all parameter estimates associated with \\nproduction method are larger in Dallas than in San Francisco. For example, the implied price \\npremium for organic eggs is about 80% in Dallas but only 30% in San Francisco. Likewise, \\nthe price premium for cage-free eggs is about 50% in Dallas but only about 21% in San \\nFrancisco. The lower percentage premiums in San Francisco vs. Dallas could be explained by \\nthe fact that overall retail egg prices are higher in San Francisco than in Dallas. However, as \\ncan be observed in table 3 (and as we show later in table 5), cage-free and organic price \\npremiums are higher in Dallas than in San Francisco, not only on a percentage basis but also \\non an absolute dollar basis as well. \\n  Differences in price premiums across location may result from differences in demand. For \\nexample, Dallas consumers may be willing to pay more for cage-free and organic eggs than \\nSan Francisco consumers. However, supply differences could also be a factor. Specifically, \\nalthough consumers in San Francisco may have a higher willingness to pay for cage-free and \\norganic eggs than their Dallas counterparts, a potentially greater supply of these types of eggs \\nin California may result in a relatively lower market price. While it is plausible that supply \\ndifferences could explain the observed price premiums, it seems unlikely. Eggs can be \\ntransported between California and Texas [the shelf life of an egg is around 3–5 weeks \\n(USDA/Food Safety and Inspection Service, 2010)], and California is a net importer of eggs \\n(Sumner et al., 2008). \\n  The highest priced egg in Dallas is the pasteurized egg—commanding a 168% premium \\nover conventional eggs. The implicit price for vegan fed (68.5% premium) is higher in Dallas 418   December 2010  Journal of Agricultural and Resource Economics \\n \\n \\nthan in San Francisco (20% premium). Implicit prices for “natural” eggs are close to zero in \\nDallas and San Francisco. The effect of egg size is quite different between these two regional \\nmarkets. Whereas larger eggs enjoy a price premium in Dallas and in the rest of the United \\nStates, small eggs command a price premium in San Francisco. It is unclear why this result \\nwas obtained in San Francisco, but it stems from the sale of a single SKU that only appeared \\nin the last 44 weeks of the data set. As such, not much can (or should) be inferred from this \\nparticular finding. \\n  At this point, it is worth asking whether the price premiums observed for cage-free and \\nfree-range eggs can be attributed to consumers’ animal welfare concerns. First, the scientific \\nevidence clearly favors the notion that hen well-being is higher in cage-free production \\nsystems than in the typical cage system [see the LayWel Research Project (2004) report, De \\nMol et al. (2006), or Norwood and Lusk (2011)]. Consequently, there is a clear link between \\nthese production systems and animal welfare. Still, it is possible that there are other unob-\\nserved factors correlated with cage-free production. Might people buy cage-free eggs for other \\nreasons than production method used? Perhaps, but our regressions control for many of these \\nfactors (color, package size, type of packaging, etc.). \\n  One obvious unobserved factor is brand name. We have information on individual brand \\nnames for each SKU, but there are too many individual brands in our sample to separately \\nidentify the effect of brand name from the individual product attributes and production \\nmethods. We partially controlled for such factors with the Private vs. Specific brand variables \\nshown in table 4. However, even if we expand on this analysis by creating dummy variables \\nfor each brand name and then omit any categorical variables that are subsequently \\nunidentified, we continue to find significant price premiums for cage-free eggs. For example, \\napplying this approach to the data from Dallas, we find that the coefficient on cage-free was \\nvery similar to the result reported in table 4 (0.43 vs. 0.407), which does not control for each \\nindividual brand name. We interpret such findings to imply that the estimated premium for \\ncage-free vs. cage eggs is unlikely to be caused by the presence of unmeasured brand-specific \\ncharacteristics. Of course, the cage-free label might carry additional connotations other than \\nimproved animal well-being, such as perceptions of better taste. Accordingly, the observed \\nprice premiums for “cage-free” include animal welfare characteristics in addition to issues \\nlike taste and quality that consumers might infer from a cage-free label. \\n  Table 5 reports predicted price premiums for several types of eggs as compared to conven-\\ntional eggs on a dollar per dozen basis.\\n6 The expected price for conventional white eggs was \\nabout $1.77/dozen in the United States and $1.90/dozen in Dallas; the expected price in San \\nFrancisco ($3.03/dozen) was substantially higher. The estimated price for a dozen cage-free, \\nbrown eggs was about $3.50/dozen in the United States, $3.57/dozen in Dallas, and \\n$4.28/dozen in San Francisco. Thus, the price premiums for cage-free, brown eggs over \\nconventional, white eggs were about $1.70/dozen in the United States and Dallas but only \\n$1.25/dozen in San Francisco. \\n  Because cage-free and organic eggs are typically brown, whereas most conventional eggs \\nare typically white, it is of interest to ask how much of the premium for cage-free and organic \\neggs typically observed is a result of egg color. To address this issue, table 5 compares the \\npredicted prices for both brown and white cage-free (and organic) eggs to the predicted price \\nfor conventional, white eggs. For example, holding egg color constant at white, the U.S. data \\n                                                 \\n6 Due to the nonlinear transformation of the regression error, the calculated price premiums are consistent but biased estimates \\nof the sample price premiums.

Based on these calculations, $0.73 of the premium \\ntypically observed in a grocery store can be attributable to color, whereas the remaining $1.00 \\nis a result of production practice (cage-free). Thus, 42% of the total premium typically \\nobserved for cage-free eggs is linked to egg color, not the fact that hens were housed in cage-\\nfree systems. Similarly, about 36.4% of the “typical” organic premium can be attributed to \\negg color rather than organic production per se. \\n \\nOn the Demand for Cage-Free and Organic Eggs \\nTo this point, we have focused on the descriptive models explaining how egg prices vary with \\nproduct characteristics. Table 4 provides estimates of the first-stage hedonic analysis and \\nreports the implicit prices of several egg characteristics. While they relate to a point on the \\ndemand curve, they do not identify the demand curve as distinct from supply-side factors. \\nHence, it is worth asking whether and to what extent our data can be used to provide structural \\nestimates of demand. \\n  In classic demand theory, consumer utility is defined over the quantity of goods consumed. \\nHowever, consumer utility can instead be written as a function of the characteristics or \\nattributes of the goods (e.g., Lancaster, 1966; Rosen, 1974; Gorman, 1980). It is assumed a \\nconsumer will choose the good (which is defined by its underlying attributes or character-\\nistics) that maximizes utility, given prices and a budget constraint. The first-order condition \\nof this maximization problem indicates that the marginal price of an attribute (i.e., the \\nderivative of the price of the composite good with respect to the underlying attribute of \\ninterest) will equal the consumer’s marginal rate of substitution between the attribute and a \\nnumeraire (see Rosen, 1974; Taylor, 2003). As demonstrated by Rosen, one can rewrite the \\noptimization problem to derive an optimal bid or willingness-to-pay function. The result of this \\noptimization problem shows that the consumer’s marginal willingness to pay for an attribute is 420   December 2010  Journal of Agricultural and Resource Economics \\n \\n \\nequal to the marginal rate of substitution between the attribute and the numeraire. Thus, from \\nthese two equalities, we find that the marginal price of an attribute equals the consumer’s \\nmarginal willingness to pay for the attribute (see Rosen). This insight is often used to link \\nimplicit prices from a hedonic model like that shown in table 4 to consumers’ willingness to \\npay at a point on the demand curve. \\n  For discrete characteristics, however, equality between the marginal implicit price and \\nmarginal rate of substitution breaks down because one cannot differentiate the utility function \\nwith respect to the discrete variable. The “1\\nst stage” coefficients associated with discrete \\ncharacteristics provide an estimate of implicit prices, but are not technically marginal rates of \\nsubstitution (or willingness to pay). Yet, Bajari and Benkard (2005) argued that the coeffi-\\ncients associated with discrete attributes provide information or bounds on willingness to pay \\ngiven the existence of a price function and an assumption about the functional form for utility \\n(see also Bajari and Kahn, 2005). They went on to show that for discrete characteristics, such \\nas cage-free or organic, the implicit hedonic prices from the first-stage regression can be \\ncoupled with data on the choices actually made by consumers to infer willingness to pay. \\n  In particular, the regression coefficients imply that consumers in Dallas faced an expected \\nimplicit price premium of $0.95/dozen for cage-free eggs, holding color constant at white (see \\ntable 5). It stands to reason that consumers who bought cage-free eggs in Dallas must have \\nbeen willing to pay at least $0.95/dozen for cage-free eggs, and consumers who chose not to \\nbuy cage-free eggs must have had a willingness to pay of something less than $0.95/dozen for \\nthis characteristic. Despite this high implicit price (or perhaps because of it), just 0.50% of \\neggs purchased in Dallas were cage-free only (see table 2). A Turnbull lower-bound estimate \\non willingness to pay for cage-free eggs in Dallas is 0.005\\n \\uf02a\\n 0.95 = $0.01/dozen (see Haab \\nand McConnell, 2002, p. 76). Similar reasoning suggests lower-bound estimates of about one \\nto three cents on cage-free and organic eggs in Dallas and San Francisco. \\n  One could take this line of reasoning further and actually estimate the mean willingness to \\npay in the population using the approach outlined in Bajari and Kahn (2005). The approach \\nrequires estimating the implicit price premium for cage-free or organic eggs at each data \\npoint, and calculating the probability of purchasing cage-free at each SKU using an assumed \\nparametric function for the distribution of willingness to pay. Coupling this probability \\nstatement with the actual quantity of each SKU sold in a likelihood function, one can arrive at \\nan estimate of the mean willingness to pay. \\n  When we apply this approach to our data, we find the estimated mean willingness-to-pay \\nvalues for cage-free and organic that rationalize the consumption data are very small.\\n7 This \\nfinding might seem counterintuitive initially, but it is perfectly consistent with the underlying \\ndata. Although the implicit prices for organic or cage-free are quite high, there are few people \\nactually willing to pay the implicit price for cage-free and organic eggs, as evidenced by the \\nsmall market shares for these products (see table 2). While some people are willing to pay the \\nimplicit price for cage-free or organic, most are not. Thus, in a population of shoppers, the \\nmean willingness to pay for cage-free (or organic) eggs is substantially less than the estimated \\nimplicit price premium for cage-free (or organic) despite the existence of a few shoppers who \\nare willing to pay significant premiums for these products.   \\n                                                 \\n7The unconstrained means are in fact negative. One could force the estimated willingness to pay for cage-free or organic to be \\npositive by picking a particular distribution such as a lognormal distribution or a uniform with a limit at zero; but in such cases, we \\nfind that the likelihood function simply converges at the boundary, $0. Chang, Lusk, and Norwood  A Hedonic Analysis of Retail Egg Prices   421 \\n \\nConclusions \\n \\nThe U.S. fresh egg market has recently witnessed an explosion in product differentiation. \\nUsing retail scanner data collected from a representative sample of grocery stores in the \\nUnited States, this study investigated the value of several egg attributes using the hedonic \\nmethod. \\n  Specialty eggs commanded significant price premiums over conventional eggs. For example, \\nthe average U.S. percentage price premium for organic and Omega-3 eggs is over 100%. \\nOther characteristics, such as egg color, package type, and egg size, were also significantly \\nrelated to egg price. We also studied hedonic egg prices in two specific metropolitan areas—\\nSan Francisco/Oakland, California, and Dallas/Fort Worth, Texas—and found significant \\ndifferences across locations. Somewhat surprisingly, estimated price premiums for cage-free \\nand organic attributes appear lower in the state for which a ballot referendum to ban battery \\ncage production recently passed than in a state many would think would be less open to \\nanimal welfare issues. Although egg prices were substantially higher in San Francisco, the \\nprice premiums for cage-free, organic, and other alternative production methods tended to be \\nhigher in Dallas. \\n  Despite the high price premiums observed for cage-free and organic eggs, our data also \\nreveal that the market shares for such products are very small. These data suggest average \\nconsumer willingness to pay in the population of egg shoppers is much less than the estimated \\nprice premiums. It should be noted that our data are not particularly informative in precisely \\narticulating the average willingness-to-pay value, in part because cage-free and organic eggs \\nare always so much higher priced than conventional eggs. One would need survey or experi-\\nmental data to better project what choices people would make were prices more similar. \\n  One interesting finding emerging from our analysis is that the retail price premiums \\nobserved for cage-free and free-range eggs appear much larger than the estimated cost \\ndifferences at the farm level. For example, Sumner et al. (2008) estimate the costs of \\nproduction to be about $0.31/dozen higher in cage-free vs. cage production systems at the \\nfarm level, but our estimates suggest the U.S. average retail price premium for cage-free eggs \\nis $1.00/dozen. The data reported here are potentially revealing in what they have to say \\nabout retailers’ pricing strategies. Although the market shares for cage-free and organic eggs \\nare small, such products appear in almost every major grocery store chain, indicating the price \\npremiums are probably not a result of the offerings of a particular kind of store. The price of \\nany one egg characteristic is influenced by the cost and value of the good, but price could also \\nbe strategically set to encourage the patronage of certain consumers, allowing the food retailer \\nto charge higher premiums on other goods. Whole turkeys at Thanksgiving are a prime \\nexample. Food retailers are suspected of selling turkeys at a loss on Thanksgiving, providing \\nconsumers with a large consumer surplus, which may increase the value of shopping at the \\nstore and increase consumers’ willingness to pay for other items (DeGraba, 2006). It is \\npossible that stores in some areas may sell cage-free eggs at lower prices than other areas as a \\nstrategy to influence store volume and price premiums for other goods. Just as turkey prices \\ndecline at precisely the same time demand rises, it is possible—though perhaps not \\nprobable—that higher demand for cage-free eggs in one location may translate into lower \\nprices. \\n  Also interesting is the mix of products offered in the market place. Apparently egg \\nproducers often bundle attributes and redundantly label attributes (e.g., an organic product is \\nboth cage-free and free-range, but some packages explicitly label all characteristics whereas 422   December 2010  Journal of Agricultural and Resource Economics \\n \\n \\nothers do not). Two often bundled characteristics (due to the particulars of egg production) \\nare egg color and cage-free production. Because our data set contains a few “unusual” SKUs \\nwhich are either brown and cage-raised or are white and cage-free, we can estimate the \\nportion of the “typical” price premium witnessed on cage-free eggs that results solely due to \\ncolor rather than a change in production practice. Based on our estimates, approximately 42% \\nof the typical cage-free premium and about 36% of the organic premium can be attributed to \\nthe fact that these products are typically brown. \\n  The hedonic approach employed in this paper is useful for identifying the implicit prices of \\negg characteristics. Such information is valuable for producers to know whether it is \\nprofitable to undertake costly investments to change production systems, and it is also \\nbeneficial in judging the potential impacts on market prices which may result from state-wide \\nballot initiatives that ban certain production practices. Future research will focus on exploring \\napproaches for estimating consumer demand (rather than implicit prices) for egg production \\ncharacteristics, identifying the determinants of demand for more “animal-friendly” products, \\nand exploring retailer pricing strategies. \\n \\n[Received September 2009; final revision received August 2010.] \\n \\n \\nReferences \\n \\nAmerican Egg Board. “Egg Industry Facts Sheet.” Online.

Results reveal significant premiums attributable to cage-free (a 57% premium on average) and organic (an 85% premium on average). However, significant variation exists among geographic locations; price premiums for organic over conventional eggs in Dallas are almost twice as high as those in San Francisco. Estimates indicate that about 42% of the typically observed premium for cage-free eggs over conventional eggs (and 36% of the premium for organic eggs) can be attributed to egg color rather than differences in hens’ living conditions. Despite the large implicit price premiums for cage-free and organic, our data reveal that most shoppers are not willing to pay such high prices for cage-free and organic attributes.</dc:description><dc:description>\\n  animal welfare, cage-free, eggs, free-range, hedonic, organic, Demand and Price Analysis, Livestock Production/Industries,</dc:description><dc:identifier>\\n  http://purl.umn.edu/97855</dc:identifier><dc:creator>\\n  Chang, Jae Bong</dc:creator><dc:creator>\\n  Lusk, Jayson L.</dc:creator><dc:creator>\\n  Norwood, F.

       "    'description': 'By synthesizing derivatives of a trans-1,2-diaminocyclohexane precursor, three new functionalized porous organic cages were prepared with different chemical functionalities on the cage periphery. The introduction of twelve methyl groups (CC16) resulted in frustration of the cage packing mode, which more than doubled the surface area compared to the parent cage, CC3. The analogous installation of twelve hydroxyl groups provided an imine cage (CC17) that combines permanent porosity with the potential for post-synthetic modification of the cage exterior. Finally, the incorporation of bulky dihydroethanoanthracene groups was found to direct self-assembly towards the formation of a larger [8+12] cage, rather than the expected [4+6], cage molecule (CC18). However, CC18 was found to be non-porous, most likely due to cage collapse upon desolvation',\n",

The introduction of twelve methyl groups (CC16) resulted in frustration of the cage packing mode, which more than doubled the surface area compared to the parent cage, CC3. The analogous installation of twelve hydroxyl groups provided an imine cage (CC17) that combines permanent porosity with the potential for post-synthetic modification of the cage exterior. Finally, the incorporation of bulky dihydroethanoanthracene groups was found to direct self-assembly towards the formation of a larger [8+12] cage, rather than the expected [4+6], cage molecule (CC18). However, CC18 was found to be non-porous, most likely due to cage collapse upon desolvation.</dc:description><dc:date>\\n2016-10-27T15:19:03Z</dc:date><dc:date>\\n2017-10-06T06:00:28Z</dc:date><dc:date>\\n2016-10-06</dc:date><dc:date>\\n2016-10-01</dc:date><dc:type>\\nJournal Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>\\n0861-9255</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>\\nhttp://hdl.handle.net/10044/1/42077</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>\\nhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/chem.201603593</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>\\nUF120469</dc:identifier><dc:relation>\\nChemistry</dc:relation><dc:rights>\\n© 2016 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Porous extended frameworks such as zeolites or metal–organic frameworks are one potential solution to this problem. Here, we show that organic molecules, rather than frameworks, can separate other organic molecules by size and shape. A molecular organic cage is shown to separate a common aromatic feedstock (mesitylene) from its structural isomer (4-ethyltoluene) with an unprecedented perfect specificity for the latter. This specificity stems from the structure of the intrinsically porous cage molecule, which is itself synthesized from a derivative of mesitylene. In other words, crystalline organic molecules are used to separate other organic molecules. The specificity is defined by the cage structure alone, so this solid-state ‘shape sorting’ is, uniquely, mirrored for cage molecules in solution. The behaviour can be understood from a combination of atomistic simulations for individual cage molecules and solid-state molecular dynamics simulations',\n",

This specificity stems from the structure of the intrinsically porous cage molecule, which is itself synthesized from a derivative of mesitylene. In other words, crystalline organic molecules are used to separate other organic molecules. The specificity is defined by the cage structure alone, so this solid-state ‘shape sorting’ is, uniquely, mirrored for cage molecules in solution. The behaviour can be understood from a combination of atomistic simulations for individual cage molecules and solid-state molecular dynamics simulations.</dc:description><dc:language>en</dc:language><dc:publisher>Nature Publishing Group</dc:publisher><dc:source>1755-4330</dc:source><dc:title>Molecular shape sorting using molecular organic cages</dc:title><dcterms:dateAccepted>2012-12-07</dcterms:dateAccepted><rioxxterms:author>Mitra, Tamoghna</rioxxterms:author><rioxxterms:author>Jelfs, Kim E.</rioxxterms:author><rioxxterms:author>Schmidtmann, Marc</rioxxterms:author><rioxxterms:author>Ahmed, Adham</rioxxterms:author><rioxxterms:author>Chong, Samanth Y.</rioxxterms:author><rioxxterms:author id=\"http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3176-1350\" >Adams, Dave J.</rioxxterms:author><rioxxterms:author>Cooper, Andrew I.</rioxxterms:author><rioxxterms:publication_date>2013</rioxxterms:publication_date><rioxxterms:type>Journal Article/Review</rioxxterms:type><rioxxterms:version>NA</rioxxterms:version><rioxxterms:version_of_record>http://doi.org/10.1038/nchem.1550</rioxxterms:version_of_record></rioxx></metadata></record>',\n",

Furthermore, the organic\\ncage appears to facilitate iodide transport across the membrane of\\na living cell, suggesting that the cage could be useful as a biological\\ntool that may replace defective iodide channels in living systems.</dc:description><dc:date>\\n          2017-05-24T00:00:00Z</dc:date><dc:type>\\n          Dataset</dc:type><dc:type>\\n          Dataset</dc:type><dc:identifier>\\n          10.1021/jacs.7b02708.s002</dc:identifier><dc:relation>\\n          https://figshare.com/articles/Iodide-Selective_Synthetic_Ion_Channels_Based_on_Shape-Persistent_Organic_Cages/5045083</dc:relation><dc:rights>\\n          CC BY-NC 4.0</dc:rights>\\n        </oai_dc:dc>\\n      </metadata>\\n    </record>',\n",

       "    'description': 'The first two cage\\nbased crystalline covalent organic frameworks, <b>cage-COF-1</b> and <b>cage-COF-2</b>, were constructed from a prism-like\\nthree-aldehyde-containing molecular cage. The cage contains two horizontal\\nphloroglucinol and three vertical triazine moieties forming three\\nidentical V-shaped cavities. By reacting with <i>p</i>-phenylenediamine\\nand 4,4′-biphenyldiamine, the two cage-COFs were formed with\\na hexagonal skeleton and possess a unique structure. Due to the pillared\\ncage nodes, the linkers are hanging with their π-surfaces but\\nnot C–H sites exposed to the pore, and enjoy certain rotational\\ndynamics as suggested by <sup>13</sup>C CP/MAS NMR. The antidirection\\nof the diimine linkages leads to rippled layers which pack in unique\\nABC mode through alternate stacking of the cage twosided faces in\\nboth AB and AC layers. Such packing forms trigonal channels along <i>c</i> axis which are interconnected in <i>ab</i> plane\\ndue to the large open space created across the hanging linkers, resembling\\nthe porous characteristics of 3D COFs. The cage-COFs have a permanent\\nporosity and can adsorb CO<sub>2</sub> facilitated by the intrinsic\\ncage cavities that serve as prime adsorption sites. The unprecedented\\ncage-COFs not only merge the borderline of 2D and 3D COFs but also\\nbridge porous organic cages to extended crystalline organic frameworks',\n",

The cage contains two horizontal\\nphloroglucinol and three vertical triazine moieties forming three\\nidentical V-shaped cavities. By reacting with <i>p</i>-phenylenediamine\\nand 4,4′-biphenyldiamine, the two cage-COFs were formed with\\na hexagonal skeleton and possess a unique structure. Due to the pillared\\ncage nodes, the linkers are hanging with their π-surfaces but\\nnot C–H sites exposed to the pore, and enjoy certain rotational\\ndynamics as suggested by <sup>13</sup>C CP/MAS NMR. The antidirection\\nof the diimine linkages leads to rippled layers which pack in unique\\nABC mode through alternate stacking of the cage twosided faces in\\nboth AB and AC layers. Such packing forms trigonal channels along <i>c</i> axis which are interconnected in <i>ab</i> plane\\ndue to the large open space created across the hanging linkers, resembling\\nthe porous characteristics of 3D COFs. The cage-COFs have a permanent\\nporosity and can adsorb CO<sub>2</sub> facilitated by the intrinsic\\ncage cavities that serve as prime adsorption sites. The unprecedented\\ncage-COFs not only merge the borderline of 2D and 3D COFs but also\\nbridge porous organic cages to extended crystalline organic frameworks.</dc:description><dc:date>\\n          2019-02-18T00:00:00Z</dc:date><dc:type>\\n          Text</dc:type><dc:type>\\n          Journal contribution</dc:type><dc:identifier>\\n          10.1021/jacs.9b00665.s003</dc:identifier><dc:relation>\\n          https://figshare.com/articles/Cage_Based_Crystalline_Covalent_Organic_Frameworks/7746365</dc:relation><dc:rights>\\n          CC BY-NC 4.0</dc:rights>\\n        </oai_dc:dc>\\n      </metadata>\\n    </record>',\n",

The cage was synthesized by employing a synthetically economical dynamic covalent chemistry (DCC) approach. The organic cage selectively transports biologically relevant iodide ions over other inorganic anions by a dehydration-driven, channel mechanism as evidenced by vesicle-based fluorescence assays and planar lipid bilayer-based single channel recordings. Furthermore, the organic cage appears to facilitate iodide transport across the membrane of a living cell, suggesting that the cage could be useful as a biological tool that may replace defective iodide channels in living systems. ? 2017 American Chemical Society.11',\n",

       "    'description': 'The first two cage\\nbased crystalline covalent organic frameworks, <b>cage-COF-1</b> and <b>cage-COF-2</b>, were constructed from a prism-like\\nthree-aldehyde-containing molecular cage. The cage contains two horizontal\\nphloroglucinol and three vertical triazine moieties forming three\\nidentical V-shaped cavities. By reacting with <i>p</i>-phenylenediamine\\nand 4,4′-biphenyldiamine, the two cage-COFs were formed with\\na hexagonal skeleton and possess a unique structure. Due to the pillared\\ncage nodes, the linkers are hanging with their π-surfaces but\\nnot C–H sites exposed to the pore, and enjoy certain rotational\\ndynamics as suggested by <sup>13</sup>C CP/MAS NMR. The antidirection\\nof the diimine linkages leads to rippled layers which pack in unique\\nABC mode through alternate stacking of the cage twosided faces in\\nboth AB and AC layers. Such packing forms trigonal channels along <i>c</i> axis which are interconnected in <i>ab</i> plane\\ndue to the large open space created across the hanging linkers, resembling\\nthe porous characteristics of 3D COFs. The cage-COFs have a permanent\\nporosity and can adsorb CO<sub>2</sub> facilitated by the intrinsic\\ncage cavities that serve as prime adsorption sites. The unprecedented\\ncage-COFs not only merge the borderline of 2D and 3D COFs but also\\nbridge porous organic cages to extended crystalline organic frameworks',\n",

The cage contains two horizontal\\nphloroglucinol and three vertical triazine moieties forming three\\nidentical V-shaped cavities. By reacting with <i>p</i>-phenylenediamine\\nand 4,4′-biphenyldiamine, the two cage-COFs were formed with\\na hexagonal skeleton and possess a unique structure. Due to the pillared\\ncage nodes, the linkers are hanging with their π-surfaces but\\nnot C–H sites exposed to the pore, and enjoy certain rotational\\ndynamics as suggested by <sup>13</sup>C CP/MAS NMR. The antidirection\\nof the diimine linkages leads to rippled layers which pack in unique\\nABC mode through alternate stacking of the cage twosided faces in\\nboth AB and AC layers. Such packing forms trigonal channels along <i>c</i> axis which are interconnected in <i>ab</i> plane\\ndue to the large open space created across the hanging linkers, resembling\\nthe porous characteristics of 3D COFs. The cage-COFs have a permanent\\nporosity and can adsorb CO<sub>2</sub> facilitated by the intrinsic\\ncage cavities that serve as prime adsorption sites. The unprecedented\\ncage-COFs not only merge the borderline of 2D and 3D COFs but also\\nbridge porous organic cages to extended crystalline organic frameworks',\n",

       "    'description': 'Molecular organic cage compounds have attracted considerable attention due to their potential applications in gas storage, catalysis, chemical sensing, molecular separations, etc. In this study, a homochiral pentyl cage compound was synthesized from a condensation reaction of (S,S)-1,2-pentyl-1,2-diaminoethane and 1,3,5-triformylbenzene. The imine-linked pentyl cage diluted with a polysiloxane (OV-1701) was explored as a novel stationary phase for high-resolution gas chromatographic separation of organic compounds. Some positional isomers were baseline separated on the pentyl cage-coated capillary column. In particular, various types of enantiomers including chiral alcohols, esters, ethers and epoxides can be resolved without derivatization on the pentyl cage-coated capillary column. The reproducibility of the pentyl cage-coated capillary column for separation was investigated using nitrochlorobenzene and styrene oxide as analytes. The results indicate that the column has good stability and separation reproducibility after being repeatedly used. This work demonstrates that molecular organic cage compounds could become a novel class of chiral separation media in the near future',\n",

The imine-linked pentyl cage diluted with a polysiloxane (OV-1701) was explored as a novel stationary phase for high-resolution gas chromatographic separation of organic compounds. Some positional isomers were baseline separated on the pentyl cage-coated capillary column. In particular, various types of enantiomers including chiral alcohols, esters, ethers and epoxides can be resolved without derivatization on the pentyl cage-coated capillary column. The reproducibility of the pentyl cage-coated capillary column for separation was investigated using nitrochlorobenzene and styrene oxide as analytes. The results indicate that the column has good stability and separation reproducibility after being repeatedly used. This work demonstrates that molecular organic cage compounds could become a novel class of chiral separation media in the near future.</dc:description><dc:creator>Shengming Xie</dc:creator><dc:creator>Junhui Zhang</dc:creator><dc:creator>Nan Fu</dc:creator><dc:creator>Bangjin Wang</dc:creator><dc:creator>Cong Hu</dc:creator><dc:creator>Liming Yuan</dc:creator><dc:publisher>MDPI AG</dc:publisher><dc:type>article</dc:type><dc:subject>porous organic cage</dc:subject><dc:subject>capillary column</dc:subject><dc:subject>chiral stationary phase</dc:subject><dc:subject>chiral separation</dc:subject><dc:subject>gas chromatography</dc:subject><dc:subject xsi:type=\"dcterms:LCSH\" >Organic chemistry</dc:subject><dc:subject xsi:type=\"dcterms:LCSH\" >QD241-441</dc:subject><dc:language>EN</dc:language><dc:provenance>Journal Licence: CC BY</dc:provenance><dc:source>Molecules, Vol 21, Iss 11, p 1466 (2016)</dc:source></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>',\n",

       "    'description': 'Porous organic cages have emerged over the last 10 years as a subclass of functional microporous materials. However, among all of the organic cages published, large multicomponent organic cages with 20 components or more are still rare. Here, we present an [8+12] porous organic imine cage, CC20, which has an apparent surface area up to 1752 m2 g -1, depending on the crystallization and activation conditions. The cage is solvatomorphic and displays distinct geometrical cage structures, caused by crystal packing effects, in its crystal structures. This indicates that larger cages can display a certain range of shape flexibility in the solid state, while remaining shape persistent and porous',\n",

However, among all of the organic cages published, large multicomponent organic cages with 20 components or more are still rare. Here, we present an [8+12] porous organic imine cage, CC20, which has an apparent surface area up to 1752 m2 g -1, depending on the crystallization and activation conditions. The cage is solvatomorphic and displays distinct geometrical cage structures, caused by crystal packing effects, in its crystal structures. This indicates that larger cages can display a certain range of shape flexibility in the solid state, while remaining shape persistent and porous.</dc:description><dc:format>application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document</dc:format><dc:identifier>http://livrepository.liverpool.ac.uk/3041616/1/cg-2018-01761s_manuscript_revised_v2.docx</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language><dc:publisher>American Chemical Society (ACS)</dc:publisher><dc:source>Crystal Growth and Design</dc:source><dc:title>Synthesis of a Large, Shape-Flexible, Solvatomorphic Porous Organic Cage</dc:title><dcterms:dateAccepted>2019-05-15</dcterms:dateAccepted><rioxxterms:author>Little, MA</rioxxterms:author><rioxxterms:author>Cooper, AI</rioxxterms:author><rioxxterms:author id=\"https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3095-875X\" >Chong, SY</rioxxterms:author><rioxxterms:author id=\"https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4736-0604\" >Hasell, T</rioxxterms:author><rioxxterms:author>Teng, Baiyang</rioxxterms:author><rioxxterms:author>Briggs, ME</rioxxterms:author><rioxxterms:author>Jelfs, K</rioxxterms:author><rioxxterms:publication_date>2019-05-15</rioxxterms:publication_date><rioxxterms:type>Journal Article/Review</rioxxterms:type><rioxxterms:version>AM</rioxxterms:version><rioxxterms:version_of_record>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.cgd.8b01761</rioxxterms:version_of_record></rioxx></metadata></record>',\n",

The resulting cage-opened fullerendione reacts with oxygen nucleophiles in the presence of (BF3Et2O)-Et-. to form fullerene hemiketal/ketal derivatives through coupling of the two carbonyl groups. Fullerene-mixed peroxide derivatives are involved in all these reactions.

       "    'description': \"PhD ThesisThe development of new porous materials for use in applications such as gas storage \\t\\nand separation processes, catalysis, catalysts supports and the removal of \\t\\nenvironmentally unfriendly species has increased rapidly over the past decade.  \\t\\nResearch into the development of these new materials has been dominated by metal \\t\\norganic frameworks, covalent organic frameworks, nanoporous polymers and, most \\t\\nrecently, porous organic cage molecules. This thesis describes adsorption studies of a \\t\\nmetal organic framework, Zn (TBAPy) and a porous tetrahedral organic cage \\t\\nmolecule of ~ 1 nm diameter formed by the condensation reaction of 1,3,5- \\t\\ntriformylbenzene with 1,2-ethylenediamine. \\t\\nThe development of metal organic frameworks has traditionally involved the \\t\\nformation of rigid network structures, analogous to that of zeolites.  More recently \\t\\nthe focus has shifted to those of dynamic, flexible framework materials, and the \\t\\nresponse of these materials to adsorption of gases and vapours.  The metal organic \\t\\nframework Zn (TBAPy) is based on a zinc metal centre functionalised with benzoate \\t\\nfragments.  The initial two-dimensional structure undergoes rearrangement of the \\t\\npaddlewheel units to form a 3D framework, Zn (TBAPy)' upon desolvation.  The \\t\\nability of this 3D network to separate p-xylene and m-xylene was investigated. It was \\t\\nfound that these isomers produced different effects on the framework, with p-xylene \\t\\nproducing a typical Type I isotherm, whereas m-xylene induced a structural change \\t\\nwithin the material, with a much slower rate of m-xylene adsorption at higher \\t\\npressures.  This could potentially lead to the equilibrium separation of these two \\t\\nisomers by the metal organic framework Zn (TBAPy)'.   \\t\\nThe 1 nm diameter tetrahedral cage molecules formed by the condensation reaction \\t\\nof 1,3,5-triformylbenzene with 1,2-ethylenediamine can exist in a number of stable \\t\\npolymorphs, Cage 1α, Cage 1β and Cage 1γ.  These polymorphs can be \\t\\ninterconverted by exposure to certain organic vapours/solvents.  The conversion of \\t\\nCage 1β to Cage 1α by adsorption of probe molecules ethyl acetate, 2-butanone, \\t\\ndiethyl ether, pentane and methanol was studied.  Adsorption of ethyl acetate, 2- \\t\\nbutanone and diethyl ether produced unusual adsorption isotherms, which included \\t\\ndesorption of adsorbed vapour with increasing pressure during the adsorption \\t\\nisotherms.  This desorption is attributed to the structural change from Cage 1β to Cage 1α.  The unusual desorption step is not observed for methanol or pentane \\t\\nadsorption.  The adsorption of methyl acetate was studied over a wide temperature \\t\\nrange in order to assess the thermodynamic and kinetic characteristics of the unusual \\t\\ndesorption step.  The adsorption of dichloromethane showed the reverse \\t\\ntransformation of Cage 1α to Cage 1β, showing that the inter conversion produces \\t\\nstable polymorphs.  The kinetics of the structural transformation followed an Avrami \\t\\nmodel and the mechanism is an activated process. \\t\\nCage 1α has voids between the cages, which are connected by very narrow \\t\\nconstrictions that allow the kinetic molecular sieving of oxygen, carbon dioxide and \\t\\nnitrogen.  It was found that oxygen adsorbs approximately ten times faster than \\t\\nnitrogen on Cage 1α, with selectivity and rate constants similar to those observed for \\t\\ncarbon molecular sieves.  The thermodynamics and kinetic results are discussed in \\t\\nterms of structural characteristics and diffusion into molecular cage materials. The \\t\\nkinetic molecular sieving is not present in the polymorph Cage 1β, which has wider \\t\\npores.EPSR\",\n",

       "    'description': 'Trp-cage is an artificial miniprotein\\nthat is small, stable, and\\nfast folding due to concerted hydrophobic shielding of a Trp residue\\nby polyproline helices. Simulations have extensively characterized\\nTrp-cage; however, the interactions of Trp-cage with organic surfaces\\n(e.g., membranes) and their effect on protein conformation are largely\\nunknown. To better understand these interactions we utilized a combination\\nof replica-exchange molecular dynamics (REMD) and metadynamics (MetaD),\\nto investigate Trp-cage folding on self-assembled monolayers (SAMs).\\nWe found that, with REMD and MetaD, Trp-cage strongly binds to neutral\\nCH<sub>3</sub> surfaces (−25<i>kT</i>) and moderately\\nadsorbs to anionic COOH interfaces (−7.6<i>kT</i>), with hydrophobic interactions driving CH<sub>3</sub> adhesion\\nand electrostatic attractions driving COOH adhesion. Similar to solid-state\\nsurfaces, SAMs facilitate a number of intermediate Trp-cage conformations\\nbetween folded and unfolded states. Regarding Trp-cage’s aromatic\\ngroups in neutral CH<sub>3</sub> systems, Tyr becomes oriented parallel\\nto the surface in order to maximize hydrophobic interactions while\\nTrp remains caged perpendicular to the surface; however, Trp can reorient\\nitself parallel to the interface as the miniprotein more closely binds\\nto the surface. In contrast, Tyr and Trp are both repelled from COOH\\nsurfaces, though the Trp-cage still adheres to the anionic interface\\nvia Lys and its N-terminated Asn residue',\n",

Simulations have extensively characterized\\nTrp-cage; however, the interactions of Trp-cage with organic surfaces\\n(e.g., membranes) and their effect on protein conformation are largely\\nunknown. To better understand these interactions we utilized a combination\\nof replica-exchange molecular dynamics (REMD) and metadynamics (MetaD),\\nto investigate Trp-cage folding on self-assembled monolayers (SAMs).\\nWe found that, with REMD and MetaD, Trp-cage strongly binds to neutral\\nCH<sub>3</sub> surfaces (−25<i>kT</i>) and moderately\\nadsorbs to anionic COOH interfaces (−7.6<i>kT</i>), with hydrophobic interactions driving CH<sub>3</sub> adhesion\\nand electrostatic attractions driving COOH adhesion. Similar to solid-state\\nsurfaces, SAMs facilitate a number of intermediate Trp-cage conformations\\nbetween folded and unfolded states. Regarding Trp-cage’s aromatic\\ngroups in neutral CH<sub>3</sub> systems, Tyr becomes oriented parallel\\nto the surface in order to maximize hydrophobic interactions while\\nTrp remains caged perpendicular to the surface; however, Trp can reorient\\nitself parallel to the interface as the miniprotein more closely binds\\nto the surface. In contrast, Tyr and Trp are both repelled from COOH\\nsurfaces, though the Trp-cage still adheres to the anionic interface\\nvia Lys and its N-terminated Asn residue.</dc:description><dc:date>\\n          2015-08-20T00:00:00Z</dc:date><dc:type>\\n          Text</dc:type><dc:type>\\n          Journal contribution</dc:type><dc:identifier>\\n          10.1021/acs.jpcb.5b04213.s001</dc:identifier><dc:relation>\\n          https://figshare.com/articles/Trp_Cage_Folding_on_Organic_Surfaces/2139268</dc:relation><dc:rights>\\n          CC BY-NC 4.0</dc:rights>\\n        </oai_dc:dc>\\n      </metadata>\\n    </record>',\n",

In recent years, organic microporous materials with well-defined structure have \\nattracted significant attention, such as metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) or porous \\ncoordination polymers (PCPs) \\n[1]\\n and covalent organic frameworks (COFs).\\n[2]\\n These extended \\nthree-dimensional networks exhibit well-defined pore structures, chemical diversity, and in \\nsome cases ultrahigh surface areas.  There is also increasing interest in the design and \\nsynthesis of porous molecular materials: that is, discrete organic molecules and \\n 2 \\n \\nmacromolecules where intermolecular forces are dominated by noncovalent interactions in the \\nsolid state.\\n[3]\\n Porous molecular materials have some potential advantages with respect to \\nporous extended networks: for example, they can be dissolved in common organic solvents. \\nThis enhances their solution processability, allowing them to be cast or combined with other \\nporous materials as composites.\\n[4]\\n Likewise, due to the lack of covalent bonding in porous \\nmolecular assemblies, porous molecules can exhibit structural mobility, which allows \\ncooperative interactions between the host and guests.\\n[5]\\n As an extreme case, it is also possible \\nto prepare ‘porous liquids’ by dissolving porous cages at high concentrations in a solvent that \\nis size-excluded from the cage cavity.\\n[6]\\n \\nPorous materials have been extensively studied in the bulk, solid state for adsorption and \\nseparation processes. Compared to adsorption-based separation processes, membrane \\nseparation technology can often be more energy-efficient for molecular-level separations of \\ngases and organic chemicals. In a broad context, fabrication of soluble, molecular \\nmicroporous materials to functional thin films would also allow a wider range of applications \\nbeyond membranes, such as sensing, energy storage, and optoelectronics\\n[7]\\n. However, the \\nfabrication of crystalline molecular solids to thin films with well-defined structure is a \\nchallenging task. Significant progress has been made with the delicate fabrication of MOFs \\ninto thin films or membranes using techniques such as secondary crystal growth,\\n[8]\\n in situ \\nsynthesis within a support\\n[9]\\n, solution-stacking of  MOF nanosheets\\n[10]\\n, and polymer-MOF \\ncomposites by coordination-driven in situ self-assembly\\n[11]\\n or incorporation into a polymer \\nmatrix\\n[12]\\n.  \\nBy contrast, industrial membranes are dominated by polymers that are fabricated by simple \\none-step solution-processing techniques. Porous organic polymers and molecules that \\ncombine microporosity and solution processability are hence highly desirable to fabricate the \\nnext-generation porous membranes. Notable examples are polymers of intrinsic microposity \\n(PIMs)\\n[13]\\n, a new class of polymers with unique rigid and contorted macromolecular structure \\n 3 \\n \\nand interconnected free volume that behaves like micropores (dimensions < 2 nm, according \\nto the definition of IUPAC). In particular, some linear PIMs can be solution-processed to thin \\nfilms and selective membranes for molecular separations.\\n[14]\\n Further modifications of PIMs \\nhave generated membranes with remarkable performance in terms of both high permeability \\nand high selectivity.\\n[15]\\n \\nDiscrete porous organic molecules, such as porous organic cages (POCs),\\n[3, 16]\\n are another \\nnovel class of porous materials with surface areas that exceed 3000 m\\n2\\n g\\n-1\\n.\\n[17]\\n Recently, we \\nprepared a series of porous organic cages (POCs) via [4+6] cycloimination reactions.\\n[18]\\n As \\nshown in Figure 1a, various types of cages can be produced by reactions between 1,3,5-\\ntriformylbenzene (TFB) with diamines, such as (1R,2R)-1,2-cyclohexanediamine (CHDA) \\n(CC3), and 2-methyl-1,2-propanediamine (CC13). Owing to their covalent bonding and rigid \\nshape, these molecules form internal cavities and extrinsic porosity due to inefficient packing. \\nPore structures and connectivity are strongly directed by the functional groups on the cage \\nvertices such that it is possible to connect or disconnect the void volume. For example, CC3 \\ncage molecules tend to pack in a window-to-window arrangement to form an ordered \\ncrystalline structure (Figure 1c), leading to the three-dimensional interconnected pore network \\n(Figure 1e). Slow crystallization of cage molecules gives a crystalline structure with long \\nrange of order, while rapid precipitation can result in short range order and defects such as \\ncrystal dislocations and grain boundaries.\\n[5b]\\n Completely disordered packing of cage \\nmolecules, as visualized in Figure 1d, is also feasible by controlling the processing of cage \\nmolecules, for example by rapid removal of the solvent guest solvent molecules. For example, \\nwe used a freeze drying approach to evaporate solvents and thus to render the CC3 in an \\namorphous state.\\n[19]\\n The disordered packing of CC3 cage molecules still leads to \\ninterconnected microporosity that includes both intrinsic intra-cage cavities and extrinsic \\ninter-cage voids (Figure 1f). These amorphous cage materials showed a high level of porosity \\nand tunable gas selectivity. The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area of amorphous \\n 4 \\n \\nCC3 reaches 898 m\\n2\\n g\\n-1\\n, which is twice the surface area of highly crystalline CC3. \\nAmorphous POCs can also be formed from cage molecules with different geometries and \\nvertex groups. For example, we have demonstrated amorphous scrambled porous organic cage \\nmolecules (ASPOC), synthesized using a mixture of different diamines, which leads to a \\ndistribution of cage species that cannot pack effectively, and therefore form amorphous solids \\nrather than crystalline materials.\\n[20]\\n These molecules are also much more soluble in organic \\nsolvents, and can be used to fabricate ‘porous liquids’,[6] or used as a stabilizer for the \\ndispersion of metal nanoparticle catalysts  in solution.\\n[21]\\n \\nWe demonstrate here the solution-processing of porous organic cage molecules into thin films, \\nshowing potential for these materials as membranes for molecular separations. To the best of \\nour knowledge, this is the first time that POCs are fabricated into continuous and defect-free \\nmicroporous thin film membranes with molecular sieving properties, without any other \\nmatrix-forming material, such as a polymer.\\n[4b]\\n The unique structure of POCs and their solid-\\nstate molecular packing differentiates our work from the known literature on other membrane \\nmaterials such as zeolites, polymers, MOFs, carbon molecular sieves, graphene, glass, metals, \\nceramics, and liquids. Hence, these results open up a new field of research on the structure \\nand properties of porous organic cage thin films and their potential technological applications. \\nWe fabricated thin films of POC molecules on various substrates by solution processing \\ntechniques, for example by spin coating. Spin coating is a common and established solution-\\nprocessing method to coat uniform thin films from a variety of solutions on flat substrates. \\nCompared to other solution-processing techniques, such as dip-coating and spray coating, \\nspin-coating is the preferred method to deposit thin and uniform films on flat substrates. We \\nstart from cage molecular solids (Figure 1g) and dissolve them in organic solvents (Figure 1h), \\nthen coat these cage molecules on various substrates. The dense packed cage film coated on \\nthe glass is transparent (Figure 1i), but can be visually observed by staining with iodine,\\n[22]\\n \\n 5 \\n \\nwhich immediately changes the film to a yellow-brown colour upon adsorption. The spin \\ncoating process involves the equilibrium between the centrifugal forces generated at a high \\nspinning speed and the viscous forces owing to the enhanced viscosity from solvent \\nevaporation. In the case of small cage molecules with sizes down to 2 nm, non-covalent \\nintermolecular forces, such as Van der Waals forces, are dominant in attracting the molecules \\ntogether to form continuous films. Therefore, as visualized in Figure 1j-k, the spin-coating of \\ncage molecules on both nonporous substrates and porous substrates leads to the formation of \\nthin films, where the cage molecules pack in a disordered state because of the rapid solvent \\nremoval. The microporosity of cage thin films allows rapid transport and diffusion of \\nmolecules; hence, cage thin films might be used as building blocks for functional materials \\nand devices, such as molecular sensors and separation membranes. \\nTo demonstrate the generality and transferability of this solution-processing approach, five \\ndifferent types of POCs were used to prepare thin films and membranes, including a \\nrepresentative crystalline cage CC3,[18] a related imine-cage, CC13,[5b] an amorphous \\nscrambled porous organic cage mixture (ASPOC) synthesized by dynamic scrambling \\ncovalent reactions,[20] a reduced amine cage (RCC3),[23] and a ‘tied’ cage (FT-RCC3) by \\nreaction of amine groups in RCC3 with carbonyls such as formaldehyde[23] that was shown \\npreviously to have exceptional stability to water, acids, and bases. More details of synthetic \\nchemistry are given in Figure S1 in the Supporting Information. The morphology of three \\nrepresentative POCs, ASPOC, CC3, and FT-RCC3, are shown in Figure 2a-c. In the solid \\nstate, ASPOC shows a poorly ordered morphology, while CC3, CC13, and FT-RCC3 have a \\nregular octahedral crystal morphology (Figure S2). X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the \\ncage solids confirmed their crystalline structure (Figure S3). FTIR spectra for cage film \\nsamples show a strong imine stretch at 1640 cm\\n-1\\n (Figure S4) for the imine cages. \\n 6 \\n \\nCage molecules were dissolved in volatile solvents, such as chloroform (boiling point, \\n61.15°C) or dichloromethane (39.6°C), to a predetermined concentration and purified by \\npassing through PTFE filters (0.2 µm). In this study, the cage solution was dropped on to the \\nsubstrate surface, with the liquid covering the whole surface up to the edges. The substrate \\nwas then accelerated to a very high angular velocity (~500 to 4000 rpm), resulting in a thin \\nuniform layer coated on the surface. Continuous cage films were formed with no observable \\npinholes or defects, as shown in Figure 2d and 2f. Occasionally, we observed by SEM \\nbuckling and exfoliation from the substrate for ASPOC thin films (Figure 2e), which is likely \\ndue to stress upon fracture in liquid nitrogen. The buckling indicates that cage thin films are, \\nto some extent, mechanically flexible. We further confirmed that similar continuous films \\ncould be fabricated from other cage molecules, including the CC13 and RCC3 cages \\n(Supporting Information, Figure S5). These cage thin films are amorphous, whether they are \\nspin-coated on silicon wafer or low-background silicon substrate, as confirmed by XRD \\n(Figure 2m and Figure S6).  \\nThe structure of cage thin films can be easily tuned by controlling the speed of spinning and \\nthe concentration of cage molecules in solution. For example, by varying the weight \\nconcentration of ASPOC molecules in chloroform from 1 wt% to 5 wt%, we were able to \\nchange the thickness of the spin-cast film from 100 nm to nearly a micron (Figure S7). The \\nporosity of cage films can be tuned from microporous to hierarchically porous by changing \\nthe composition of cage solutions, for example, use of co-solvents of dichloromethane (DCM) \\nand methanol at different fractions. For example, CC3 cage molecules were dissolved in a \\nmixture of DCM and methanol, with the weight percentage of methanol in the mixture \\nvarying from 2 wt% to 40 wt%. In this case, the addition of a small amount of methanol into \\nthe solvent significantly enhanced the solubility of the CC3. The resulting spin-coated CC3 \\nfilms show a significantly different morphology. As shown in Figure 2(f-g) and Figure S8, \\n 7 \\n \\ncage films spin-coated from co-solvent with low fraction of methanol (2-10wt%) are densely \\npacked and essentially microporous with no observable mesopores or macropores. By contrast, \\ncage solutions containing excess methanol (> 10 wt%) generate hierarchically porous films \\nwith interconnected nanoparticles with sizes at ~100 nm (Figure 2g), owing to the phase \\nseparation induced by solvent evaporation. XRD patterns confirmed that both dense and \\nporous films are amorphous (Figure S8). Similar phase separation phenomenon occurred for \\nRCC3 cages and consequently macropores were formed in the films when the cage molecules \\nwere spin-coated at low speed (1000 rpm) (Figure S9). \\nFor the more rigid, tied cage, FT-RCC3, hierarchically porous thin films can also be formed. \\nAs the solubility of FT-RCC3 in chloroform or DCM was very low, a small amount of \\nmethanol was again added to the solvent to enhance the solubility of cage molecules (up to 4 \\nwt%) so that thicker films could be prepared, but hierarchically porous films were then \\nobtained (Figure 2h and Figure S10). In this case, the weak peaks in the XRD pattern indicate \\nthe presence of small nanocrystals. These hierarchically porous cage thin films may be useful \\nin a range of applications, such as templates for nanostructured films, or supports for catalysis.  \\nThese high-quality cage thin films have potential for absorption-based sensing based on optics \\nor absorption spectroscopy.\\n[4a]\\n Cage molecules were spin-coated on thin quartz glass \\nsubstrates to form thin films with a thickness of 100 nm. Subsequently, the cage thin films \\nwere exposed to iodine solids in a glass vial. Some of the sublimed iodine was absorbed in the \\ncage thin films, as evidenced by a dark brown coloration in this film (Fig. 1i). We tracked the \\nUV-visible absorbance as a function of adsorption time. As shown in the Supporting \\nInformation (Figure S11), the UV-vis spectra showed a strong absorbance peak at 400 nm \\nupon exposure to iodine. The increase of absorbance corresponds to the amount of iodine \\nmolecules adsorbed in the cage films. The UV irradiation may induce halogenation reactions \\nof iodine with POC molecules, and hence desorption of the iodine molecules is relatively slow \\n 8 \\n \\nand not complete even after 24 h, indicating that it is possible to utilize similar reaction \\nstrategy to modify the cage thin films.  \\nWe further fabricated POC thin film composite (TFC) membranes by spin coating cage \\nmolecules on porous anodized aluminum oxide (AAO) filter discs. The films in this work \\nwere spin-coated directly on the membrane supports without any intermediate coating or \\nsacrificial layer. The size of cage molecules are so small that they can potentially penetrate \\nthrough the surface layer of AAO support (pore size of 20 nm) and enter into the larger \\nnanochannels (pore size of 200 nm) (Figure 2i). Pinhole and defects lead to low selectivity \\n(close to Knudsen diffusion selectivity) and a significant increase of permeance if a \\ncontinuous film is not formed. Nevertheless, defect-free films could be prepared by simply \\nspin coating cage solutions on the surface of the AAO substrates, as shown in Figure 2j and \\n2k, and Supporting information Figure S12. Some cage molecules seem to be embedded in \\nthe 20 nm nano-channels in the AAO support, but they do form a continuous and defect-free \\nskin layer. We performed XRD analyses of these thin films and confirmed that they are \\namorphous (Figure S13). The success rate of fabricating defect-free films was significantly \\nenhanced by using more concentrated cage solutions (up to 4 wt%) (Figure 2l). Such higher \\nconcentration increases the viscosity of the cage solution and consequently results in thicker \\nfilms while the penetration of the cage solution into the interior of the support was also \\nlimited during the spinning process. In some cases, it is relatively difficult to determine the \\naccurate thickness for the thin film composite membranes because of the penetration into the \\nlarge channels in the alumina support that occurred for some cage molecules, including \\nASPOC, CC13, and RCC3. Interestingly, the degree of penetration of cage molecules into \\nthe substrates seems to be related to the structural flexibility of the cage molecules. For the \\nmost flexible RCC3 cages, the material cannot form a continuous film at the surface (Figure \\nS14). In contrast, the more rigid FT-RCC3 cages showed phase separation behaviour, as also \\n 9 \\n \\nobserved on nonporous substrates (Supporting information Figure S14). In addition, polymer \\nthin films were also prepared from a low-free-volume polyimide (Matrimid\\n® \\n5218) and a \\nmicroporous PIM-1 polymer (SEM images are given in Figure S15), as good control for \\nmeasurements of gas transport properties. \\nGas transport in glassy polymeric materials follows the solution-diffusion model, where the \\ngas molecules are absorbed in the free volume elements and diffuse through the membrane. In \\nthe case of microporous cage thin films, gas transport can also be described by the solution-\\ndiffusion model. To have a better understanding of the gas solubility and diffusivity and their \\nrelationships with the structure, we measured gas sorption properties of cage solids using \\nvarious techniques. As shown in Figure 3a, N2 sorption isotherms of ASPOC and amorphous \\nCC3 confirmed the presence of microporosity in these disordered solids. We also measured \\ngas sorption isotherms at room temperature (Figure 3b) and derived the gas solubility at 1 bar \\n(Figure 3c). Detailed isotherms are given in Figure S16. The gas solubility follows the \\nsequence of CO2 > CH4 > N2 > H2, corresponding well to the critical temperature of gas \\nmolecules. These values of gas solubility in cage molecules are comparable to those in PIM-1 \\npolymer.\\n[15b]\\n Particularly, the high CO2 sorption capacity in cage solids reflects the favorable \\nsolubility in micropores or free volume elements and intermolecular interactions between CO2 \\ngas molecules and cages.\\n[18b]\\n  \\nWe further demonstrated that cage thin film composite membranes show remarkable \\nmolecular sieving performance in terms of high permeance and molecular selectivity. Single \\ngas transport properties of cage thin films were measured at 295\\u2009K with industrially important \\ngas molecules with different kinetic diameters, including He (2.65 Å), H2 (2.89\\u2009Å), CO2 \\n(3.3\\u2009Å), Ar (3.40 Å), O2 (3.46\\u2009Å), N2 (3.64\\u2009Å) and CH4 (3.82\\u2009Å),\\n[24]\\n using a time-lag \\napparatus.\\n[25]\\n First, we proved the high gas permeance through the AAO support alone (Figure \\nS17), for example, H2 and CO2 permeance are 1.7×10\\n-4\\n mol m\\n-2\\n s\\n-1 \\nPa\\n-1 \\nand 4×10\\n-5\\n mol m\\n-2\\n s\\n-1 \\n 10 \\n \\nPa\\n-1\\n, respectively. Therefore, the gas permeation resistance of the AAO support can be \\nneglected in TFC membranes. In addition, we also measured the gas transport properties of \\npolymer thin film membranes spin-cast from a dense polyimide (Matrimid\\n® \\n5218) and a \\nmicroporous PIM-1 polymer. For example, PIM-1 thin film gives an initial high CO2 \\npermeability of 2960 Barrer while Matrimid\\n® \\n5218 gives a CO2 permeability of about 10 \\nBarrer. These gas transport properties are very close to those measured with thick polymer \\nfilms in the same apparatus.\\n[25]\\n Therefore, these polymer thin films serve as reliable controls \\nfor comparing the gas transport properties of cage thin films.  \\nGas permeation data for three representative cage thin films, CC3, ASPOC, and CC13, are \\nshown in Figure 3d.  The data reported here are the values measured at the point when the \\nselectivity became stable. More detailed data are shown in the supporting information (Figure \\nS18 and Table S1). For a typical CC3 membrane spin-coated with 1 wt% cage solution in a \\nco-solvent of DCM and methanol (methanol concentration of 2 wt%) at 2000 rpm, the gas \\npermeances follow the order of H2 >CO2 >O2 >CH4 >N2. The initial permeance of H2 is as \\nhigh as 1.53×10\\n-6\\n mol m\\n-2\\n s\\n-1 \\nPa\\n-1\\n, with high H2/N2 selectivity of 30 and a H2/CH4 selectivity \\nclose to 20. The initial CO2 permeance is up to 9.2×10\\n-7\\n mol m\\n-2\\n s\\n-1 \\nPa\\n-1\\n with CO2/N2 \\nselectivity of ~19 and a CO2/CH4 selectivity of ~10. The measured gas permeances of CC3 \\nthin films are 10–20 times higher than that for reported MOF membranes (10–30 µm),[26] or \\nzeolite membranes (see Table S1),\\n[27]\\n presumably because our cage films are much thinner \\n(down to 50 nm). In the case of ASPOC films, gas permeances are relatively lower owing to \\npenetration of the cages into the substrates, even though a concentrated solution (4 wt% in \\nchloroform) was used. CC13, which has two methyl groups per vertex, shows much lower \\npermeance, but still shows molecular sieving performance. For ASPOC, the ideal selectivity \\nof CO2/N2 is surprisingly as high (25–30), which is in agreement with its favourable \\n 11 \\n \\nadsorption of CO2 (1.65 mmol g\\n-1\\n) and high solubility selectivity of CO2/N2 (~6.5). Such \\nbehaviour is similar to that observed in glassy polymers, such as polyimide and PIMs.  \\nWe then calculated the gas permeability from permeance multiplied by thickness (P=J×L). \\nWe quantified the average penetration depth as observed in SEM and assumed this depth to be \\nthe effective thickness of the membrane. We then estimated the apparent permeability. We \\nfurther compare the gas transport properties in the upper bound plot of selectivity versus \\npermeability. A typical H2/N2 gas pair is shown in Figure 4. For a representative 50-nm-thick \\nCC3 membrane, the initial H2 permeability is about 226 Barrer, while CC13 cages show H2 \\npermeability of 48 Barrer. Certainly, these cage thin films have relatively low permeability \\ncompared to PIM-1 polymer thin films (H2 permeability close to 2000–3000 Barrer), but they \\nare still much more permeable than conventional low-free-volume polymers (e.g., H2 \\npermeability of Matrimid at about 20–30 Barrer). Similar results were found for other gas \\npairs as shown in Supporting Information (Figure S18). Based on the gas solubility and \\npermeability, we derived the diffusion coefficients for various gas molecules (D=P/S). The \\ngas diffusivities can be correlated with effective molecular size, as plotted in Figure 3f. For 24 \\nh-aged ASPOC, H2 diffusivity was as high as 9.5×10\\n-7\\n cm\\n2\\n s\\n-1\\n, while N2 and CH4 diffusivities \\nwere 1.1×10\\n-8\\n cm\\n2\\n s\\n-1\\n and 6.1×10\\n-9\\n cm\\n2\\n s\\n-1\\n, respectively. The cage thin films show high \\ndiffusivity selectivity for gas pairs H2/CO2 (~20), H2/N2 (~87) and H2/CH4 (~155). Similar \\nresults were found for amorphous CC3 thin films. These analyses confirm the molecular \\nsieving properties of cage thin films, although their diffusion coefficients are relatively lower \\nthan those of rigid polymer networks. \\nExtensive studies on physical aging of glassy polymer thin films have shown that minor \\ndecreases of free volume with time result in significant loss of permeability.\\n[28]\\n Here, we \\nobserved significant loss in gas permeability for all cage thin films (Supporting Information, \\nFigures S18 and S19). Cages with different structures show varied aging behavior. As shown \\n 12 \\n \\nin Figure 4, ASPOC cages give high H2 permeability of 643 Barrer but with low selectivity \\nof H2/N2 (5.8 initially). The permeability quickly decreased after aging for 24 h while \\nselectivity increased for all gas pairs, e.g., H2 permeability decreased to 187 Barrer, while the \\nH2/N2 selectivity unexpectedly increased to above 30.  Similarly, CO2 permeability dropped \\nto 160 Barrer with CO2/CH4 selectivity increasing up to 17. Afterwards, the ideal gas \\nselectivity maintained relatively stable but the gas permeability continued to decrease over 30 \\ndays. For thinner CC3 (~50 nm), the ideal selectivity was relatively stable, but the \\npermeability also decreased significantly. In the case of thicker CC3 film (~300 nm), both \\npermeability and selectivity showed immediate loss. These films remained amorphous even \\nafter aging for several months.  \\nThe complex aging phenomena of cage thin films are not yet fully understood. In this study, a \\nvery thin layer of cage molecules were coated on the alumina to form thin film composite \\n(TFC) membranes, instead of free-standing cage membranes. Therefore, unlike free-standing \\npolymer films,\\n[15]\\n N2 sorption and surface areas of cage TFC membranes before and after use \\nwere not easily measured. While the permeability in cage membranes decreased significantly \\n(e.g. 10 times lower in 24 h for ASPOC membrane), gas sorption capacities of cage solids \\nremained at high levels after being evacuated under vacuum for 24 h. Since permeability is a \\nproduct of solubility and diffusivity, the loss of gas permeability may be attributed to decrease \\nin diffusivity. From the materials perspective, these amorphous cage thin films are in \\nmetastable states that are kinetically trapped during the spin coating, which leads to an \\ninhomogeneous density within the material. The lower density regions are in pseudo-\\nequilibrium state and tend to pack more densely to minimize free volume over time. \\nPreviously, we designed a simulation methodology for generating amorphous cage models, \\nand investigated gas diffusivities and diffusion mechanism in amorphous organic cage \\nsystems.\\n[29]\\n We found that the contribution of the extrinsic (between cages) and intrinsic \\n 13 \\n \\n(within cages) porosity to the total porosity has a significant effect on pore connectivity and \\ngas diffusion pathway. Denser packing of cage molecules in the amorphous thin film state \\nwould result in a loss of extrinsic voids, which hinders the gas diffusion pathways (e.g. lower \\ndegree of connectivity of free volume or micropores, whether intrinsic or extrinsic) and \\nconsequently decreased the gas permeability in the aged cage thin films.  \\nThe molecular sieve membranes fabricated from porous organic cage molecules are \\ninsufficiently robust for many practical applications due to physical ageing, and limited \\nchemical and thermal stability, for example, in CO2 separation of steam-containing flue gas, \\nor separation of H2/CO2 at high temperatures. For example, hydrolysis of the imine-linkages \\nin cage molecules may occur upon exposure to water, acidic and basic conditions. Further \\nwork is in progress to produce more stable films, for example, transforming cage thin films to \\nmore chemically stable ones (such as FT-RCC3), or introducing stronger intermolecular \\nforces into cages to form rigid and stable networks (e.g., by designing specific hydrogen \\nbonding interactions between cages, or covalent crosslinking). On the other hand, the flexible \\nproperty of cage solids and thin films may be useful in other applications, for example, \\ncontrolled release of guest molecules (e.g. drug molecules), or adaptive materials. \\nIn conclusion, we have demonstrated that porous organic cages can be solution-processed into \\ncoherent thin films with tunable structure and porosity. The thin films show potential in \\nmolecular sensing and selective molecular sieve membranes for molecular-level separations. \\nThe fabrication technique via spin coating is a simple, reproducible, and easily controlled \\nprocess that yields uniform and defect-free thin films with excellent thickness control.  Such \\nease of fabrication is achievable by the solution processability of POC molecules as building \\nblocks. Our work also leads to better understandings of the factors that determine the phase-\\nseparation and microstructure in these systems, with which we could generate hierarchically \\nporous cage thin films that may serve as platform for functional materials. We further \\ndemonstrate the proof-of-concept viability of molecular sieve membranes fabricated from \\n 14 \\n \\nporous organic cage molecules. The solution processability of POCs allows coating and \\nmodification of various membranes to form composite membranes for separation of \\nindustrially and environmentally important gas molecules. Although these first-generation \\nmolecular cage films tend to densify over time, as reflected by loss in gas permeability under \\nvacuum, they are chemically robust as shown by stable selectivity even after 30 days. Our \\nwork suggests a simple and generic approach that facilitates the fabrication of cage thin films \\nand membranes, for example in applications such as functional coatings, composites, sensing, \\ncatalysis, separation membranes, and energy storage.  \\nExperimental Section \\nSynthesis of Porous Organic Cages:  All the cages, CC3, CC13, ASPOC, RCC3, and FT-\\nRCC3 were synthesized following previous work. CC3 was synthesized from reactions \\nbetween 1,3,5-triformylbenzene and (1R,2R)-1,2-cyclohexanediamine in dichloromethane at \\nroom temperature.\\n[18]\\n The crystals were recovered by filtration, and  washed with 95% \\nethanol/5% dichloromethane, and finally dried under vacuum. CC13 was synthesized by \\nreactions between 2-Methyl-1,2-propanediamine and 1,3,5-Triformylbenzene, followed by \\nprecipitation in  petroleum ether, and further vacuum dried[5b]. Amorphous scrmabled porous \\norganic cages (ASPOC) were synthesized by co-reaction of 1,3,5-triformylbenzene (TFB) \\nwith a mixture of both 1,2-ethylenediamine (EDA) and (1R,2R)-1,2-cyclohexanediamine \\n(CHDA) leads to an equilibrium distribution of products incorporating both EDA-linked and \\nCHDA-linked vertices in a single cage molecule[20]. RCC3 was synthesized by reducing \\nCC3 with NaBH4 in a mixture of chloroform and methanol[23]. FT-RCC3 was prepared by \\nreacting the RCC3 cages with paraformaldehyde in methanol at 70 °C[23]. The reaction was \\ncooled to room temperature and the FT-RCC3 was obtained after filtration and washing with \\nmethanol and further dried under vacuum. \\nFabrication of cage thin films: The cage solids were dissolved in solvents to give cage \\nsolution with a certain concentration. In some cases, co-solvents of methanol (MeOH) and \\n 15 \\n \\ndichloromethane (DCM) or chloroform was used with mass ratios changed. The cage solution \\nwas then purified by syringe filters (PTFE, 0.2 µm). After, cage thin films were prepared by \\nspin coating the cage solution on different substrates. A drop of cage solution is applied on the \\nsubstrate which is not spinning initially. Then the substrate is rotated at high speed (500-4000 \\nrpm, typically at 2000 rpm) with an acceleration speed of 1500 rpm. \\nCharacterization techniques: Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analyses were performed \\nusing a Hitachi S5500 microscope. The films were fractured in air and coated with a 2-nm-\\nthick layer of gold using an Emitech sputter coater. Wide angle X-ray diffraction (XRD) was \\nperformed with a Bruker D8 machine operated at 40 mA and 40 kV using Cu Kα radiation \\nwith a step of 0.02° per second. Cage films for XRD analysis were prepared with various \\nsubstrates, particularly cages were coated directly on low-background Si sample holders.  \\nFourier Transform Infrared Spectra (FTIR) were collected on a Nicolet spectrometer. Cage \\nfilms were coated on CaCl2 disks and analyzed in transmission mode. Ultraviolet–visible \\nabsorption spectra were measured using a spectrometer, with an operating spectral range of \\n190–1000\\u2009nm. \\nGas adsorption measurements: N2 adsorption and desorption isotherms were measured at \\n77.3 K using Micromeritics 2020, or 2420 volumetric adsorption analyser. Powder samples \\nwere degassed offline at 110°C for 15 h under dynamic vacuum (10\\n-5\\n bar) before analysis. \\nGas sorption isotherms of CO2, CH4, N2, and H2 were also measured at 295 K with pressure \\nup to 1 bar.  \\nIodine absorption and sensing: The cage solution (1 wt%) were spin-coated on quartz \\nsubstrate at a speed of 2000 rpm. Prior to spin coating, quartz plates were cleaned with \\nacetone and isopropanol in ultrasound bath for 10 min, respectively. The thin films coated on \\nquartz plates were exposed to iodine solids to allow the adsorption of iodine in the films. The \\nUV-visible absorption spectra were tracked as a function of sorption time. \\n 16 \\n \\nFabrication of thin film composite membranes: POCs based thin film composite membranes \\nwere prepared by simply spin coating cage solutions on porous support. Anodized aluminum \\noxide (AAO) membrane (Anodisc, Whatman) with a surface layer of 20 nm nanopores were \\nused as porous supports. The gas permeances through the support are signiciantly higher than \\nthose in cage thin films. The membrane disc as ordered has an annular polypropylene ring. \\nThe support membrane was fixed on a PTFE substrate for spin-coating.  The inorganic \\nmembrane support is quite brittle, so care was taken to fix and transfer the support from spin-\\ncoating to gas permeation tests. \\nGas permeation tests: Pure gas permeation tests were carried out at temperature of 22°C and \\nfeed pressure of 1 bar, using a constant-volume pressure-increase apparatus described in detail \\nelsewhere\\n[15b, 25]\\n. The membrane was loaded in the apparatus and thoroughly evacuated with a \\nvacuum pump (Edwards RV3) prior to gas permeation measurements. The gas permance (J, \\nmol m\\n-2\\n s\\n-1\\n Pa\\n-1\\n) was measured directly. The ideal selectivity for a gas pair (A/B) is calculated \\nfrom the ratio of their permeance. The uncertainties of the as-measured permeance at the \\nmoment of test are within ±10%, and selectivity within ±15%. Gas permeability (P) was \\ncalculated from multiplying the permance with the thickness of the effective layer of POC \\nfilm (P=J×L). P is expressed in Barrer (1 Barrer=10\\n−10\\n cm\\n3\\n(STP)cm·cm\\n−2\\n·s\\n−1\\n·cmHg\\n−1\\n). The \\nsolubility of gas molecules in POCs were quantified from gas sorption measurements up to 1 \\nbar at 295 K. The diffusion coefficient (D) (at 1 bar) is calculated from the permeability \\n(D=P/S). \\nSupporting Information  \\nSupporting Information is available from the Wiley Online Library or from the author. \\n \\nAcknowledgements \\nThis work was financially supported by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research \\nCouncil (EPSRC, UK, EP/H000925/1), European Research Council (ERC) and an NPRP \\ngrant from the QNRF (Qatar).

\\nIntroduction \\n \\n \\n1.1 Synthesis of Cages \\n \\nThe synthesis of porous molecular cages uses a host of different methods. Each of these \\nindividual precursors run through a step by step process for completion. In this section below we \\ngo through the process of creating the Ps, Pm, and Pl precursors that are used in the reaction. It is \\nimportant to know how each step of the process was run because we are simulating each phase of \\nthe synthesis process.  \\nThe synthesis of the simplest precursor Ps, or chemically 1,3,5-Tris(4-propynylbenzyl)-\\n2,4,6-triethylbenzene1, begins with triethylbenzene being converted to 1,3,5-tribromomethyl-\\n2,4,6-triethylbenzene. From there, the tribromomethyl was converted to 1,3,5-Tris(4-\\ntrimethylsilylbenzyl)-2,4,6-triethylbenzene using a copper(I)-catalyzed coupled reaction2. The \\ntrimethylsilylbenzyl groups were then converted to iodiobenzyl using iodine monochloride, \\ncreating 1,3,5-Tris(4-iodobenzyl)-2,4,6-triethylbenzene.3 The triiodo compound reacted with 1-\\npropynylmagnesium bromide using Kumada coupling to finally create the Ps compound4, 1,3,5-\\nTris(4-propynylbenzyl)-2,4,6-triethylbenzene. The copper(I)-catalyzed coupling reaction was \\nused in order to speed up the reaction between the tribromomethyl and the Grignard reagent to \\nmake the trimethylsilylbenzyl. \\nThe formation of the second precursor Pm, or 1,3,5-Tris(4-propynyl-2,6-dimethoxy-1,1’-\\nbiphenyl)-2,4,6-triethylbenzene, begins with synthesizing the compound that is used to extend \\nthe arm lengths of the previous Ps precursor3. 1-bromo-3,5-dimethoxybenzene starts in \\nanhydrous THF and cooled to -78 Celsius3. Then, n-BuLi and trimethylsilyl chloride were added \\nin succession to form (3,5-dimethoxyphenyl)trimethylsilane. This compound was then placed \\n   2 \\ninto anhydrous THF solution and cooled to -78 Celsius with n-BuLi added as well. Trimethyl \\nborate was also added to form 4-trimethylsilyl-2,6-dimetoxyphenylboronic acid3. The 1,3,5-\\nTris(4-iodobenzyl)-2,4,6-triethylbenzene from the synthesis of Ps was reacted via a Suzuki \\ncoupling reaction with the trimethylsilyl created in the previous step, along with Pd(OAc)2, \\nSphos, K3PO4, to then form 1,3,5-Tris(4-trimethylsilyl-2,6-dimethoxy-1,1’-biphenyl)-2,4,6-\\ntrietylbenzene3. Iodine monochloride was reacted with this product within CH2Cl2 to form 1,3,5-\\nTris(4-iodo-2,6-dimethoxy-1,1’-biphenyl)-2,4,6-trietylbenzene. Finally, the 4-iodo-2,6-\\ndimethoxy-1,1’-biphenyl compound was degassed and mixed with PdCl2dppf in THF along with \\n1-propynylmagnesium bromide, to run a Kumada coupling reaction, and form the final product \\nof 1,3,5-Tris(4-propynyl-2,6-dimethoxy-1,1’-biphenyl)-2,4,6-triethylbenzene or Pm.3 \\nThe synthesis of Pl, or 1,3,5-Tris(4-propynyl-2,3’,5’,6-tetramethoxy-1,1’;4’,1’’-terphenyl)-\\n2,4,6-triethylbenzene, begins mimicking the creation of Pm. Firstly, 1-bromo-3,5-\\ndimethoxybenzene was reacted with 4-trimethylsilyl-2,6-dimetoxyphenylboronic acid along with \\nPd(OAc)2, Sphos, and K3PO4 to create trimethyl(2’3’5’6’-tetramethoxy-[1,1’-biphenyl]-4-\\nyl)silane.3 This product was then placed in anhydrous THF, mixed with n-BuLi, cooled to -78 \\nCelsius, and reacted with trimethyl borate to create 4’-trimethylsilyl-2’3’5’6’-tetramethoxy-\\n(1,1’-bipheynyl)boronic acid. The boronic acid is then mixed with 1,3,5-Tris(4-iodobenzyl)-\\n2,4,6-triethylbenzene from the synthesis of Ps, much like the creation of Pm. These two \\nmolecules, along with Pd(OAc)2, Sphos, and K3PO4 reacted via a Suzuki coupling reaction in \\norder to create 1,3,5-Tris(4-trimethylsilyl-2’3’5’6’-tetramethoxy-1,1’;4’,1’’-terphenyl)-2,4,6-\\ntriethylbenzene.3 That product was then placed into CH2Cl2 and mixed with iodine monochoride \\nto create 1,3,5-Tris(4-iodo-2,3’,5’,6-tetramethoxy-1,1’;4’,1’’-terphenyl)-2,4,6-triethylbenzene. \\nFinally, that product was degassed in THF and mixed with 1-propynylmagnesium bromide to run \\nthe Kumada coupling reaction to form the final product 1,3,5-Tris(4-propynyl-2,3’,5’,6-\\ntetramethoxy-1,1’;4’,1’’-terphenyl)-2,4,6-triethylbenzene, or Pl.3 \\nAs a background of one method used above, Suzuki coupling is an organic reaction \\nbetween a boronic acid and an organohalide.6 Within the Pm and Pl syntheses, the precursor for \\nPs was used for both reactions. The iodine group on the Ps precursor acted as the organohalide. \\nThe varying length boronic acids were the boronic acid of the reaction, and the palladium group \\nwas used as the metal catalyst. The importance of Suzuki coupling is that the reaction is able to \\npromote near exponential growth of organic molecule production while minimizing the amount \\n   3 \\nof reagents used. This is done by repeating a small amount of reaction steps. Reacting the initial \\nreagent with TMS and the bromine terminus to create either a TMS and boronic acid terminus \\nand an iodine bromine terminus in equal parts allows for a reaction with the boronic acid and \\niodine to double the length of the initial intermediate.  \\nIn these reactions, Kumada coupling7 was also used in order to save time and materials for \\nthe reactions. As a background of the coupling, a palladium complex cross coupling reaction is \\nused to generate carbon-carbon bonds. This couples a Grignard reagent with an alkyl, vinyl, or \\naryl halide. Palladium is used as a transition metal catalyst and, in our reactions, the bromine was \\nused within the reaction.  \\nAfter their formation, all three precursors were then reacted individually in order to create \\nthe three different molecular cages. The smallest cage, Ts, was created by first taking the Ps \\nprecursor and dissolving it in TCB. From there another compound, molybdenum(IV) propylidine \\nprecatalyst5 was mixed with excess triphenylsilanol ligand and dissolved also in TCB. These two \\nsolutions were mixed together to then create the Ts tetramer cage.3 The formation of the Tm cage \\nfollowed similarly to the Ts cage. Pm was dissolved in CHCl3 along with the molybdenum \\npropylidine(IV) precatalyst to form Tm.3 Tl followed the same path while using the Pl precursor \\nalong with CHCl3 and the molybdenum(IV) propylidine precatalyst to form Tl.3  \\nIn the formation of the tetrameric cage, a process called alkyne metathesis is used8-10. As a \\nbackground for this paper, metathesis is typically an exchanging of bonds between two reacting \\nspecies. This metathesis is used in order to react two species attached to an alkyne bond which \\nthen forms a new connected molecule along with a small byproduct. In this case, the cage was \\nthe main reaction product with an acetylene byproduct. The use of a molybdenum catalyst helps \\nfacilitate the bindings in the two reacting species. Along with the controlled reactions that alkyne \\nmetathesis offers, this reaction is also beneficial for formation due to the fact that it gives much \\nstronger bonds between the newly created alkynes. This stability helps to form a rigid structure \\nwithin the molecular cage to avoid unnecessary bending.  \\nThe formation of these porous molecular cages involves another method called Dynamic \\nCovalent Chemistry (DCC). This method was developed as a conformational analysis by \\nallowing the equilibration of configurational isomers using both acids and bases. Dynamic \\ncovalent chemistry holds most of its appeal by being able to adjust the product distribution of a \\nreaction by changing the reaction environment.11-13 This means that there is the ability to reverse \\n   4 \\nthe formation of unwanted products through changing the environment in which the reaction \\ntakes place. Then by adjusting the environment yet again we’re able to create the desired product \\nfrom the reversed unwanted product. Adjusting the path that the reactant takes in equilibrium can \\nbe controlled thermodynamically by having one product lower in energy than the other, curbing \\nthe formation to one product over any other. Dynamic covalent chemistry takes the appeal of \\nsupramolecular chemistry. That appeal being the ability to control the thermodynamic stability of \\nequilibrium, while also adding an additional ability of reversing unwanted products. These \\ntogether allow for the creation of desired products and works as an error checking process when \\ncombined together.11-13 One drawback from having DCC being an equilibrium process is that it \\nruns much slower than supramolecular chemistry. This is due to the breaking of covalent bonds \\ntaking longer than noncovalent bonds, but these problems can be resolved by introducing a \\ncatalyst to the solution. In addition to speeding up the forward process, the catalyst also allows \\nfor the reverse process to take place, which would happen rarely otherwise. Having the ability to \\nchange compounds using DCC and external environmental factors leads to the ability to create \\ncompounds that can adapt to their surroundings. DCC can also be the key to create highly \\ncomplex covalently bonded architectures. Within DCC there are a number of methods used to \\ncreate porous materials including alkene metathesis14, boronic acid condensation15, and imine \\nformation16. Alkyne metathesis is primarily used in this paper due to its ability to form structural \\nrigidity with its ethylene bonds.  \\nSome applications using the development of porous organic cages include molecular \\nseparation and storage, the ability to separate two different compounds in a solution by \\nextracting one through a selective porous molecular cage, followed by the storage of that \\nmaterial. There are host-guest selectivity and nanometric reaction environments, such as \\nselecting a specific compound from a solution and allowing that compound to react in a \\nnanometric environment; much like how enzymes operate. Finally, there is catalysis, where \\nmuch like the nanometric reaction environments, there is control in speeding up a reaction taking \\nplace through the use of a host of cages.17-21 \\nAlthough scientists want to create these cages for their applications, there is a reason why \\nit is so difficult to create these cages. Throughout the creation of these porous organic cages \\nthere may be a number of side chain reactions that can take place at each individual step, which \\ndeviates from the intended product. During the process of cage formation any multiple variations \\n   5 \\nof chain lengths can attach to cages in formation. This causes the cage forming process to stop or \\nslow down because an unintended product is being formed. In order to get an intended product, \\nthe unintended product must break apart prior to reforming.  \\n A problem with the creation of these porous organic cages is that there is no clear method \\nof development that leads to total cage formation solely by examining the precursor. We intend \\nto use molecular dynamic simulations in order to make predictions of the likelihood for these \\nself-assembled cages to continue through each stage of their reaction. Previous work has been \\ndone with both bond angles22, and precursor size23. Once we are then able to predict cage \\nformation behavior based upon bond angles, precursor size, bond lengths, and other factors, are \\nwe then able to form porous organic cages without multiple processes of trial and error. \\n \\n1.2 Molecular Dynamics \\n \\nMolecular dynamics is a way of simulating molecular behavior based upon the potential \\nenergies of the molecules as well as the trajectories those molecules take. The potential energy \\neach molecule possesses is dependent upon the force field used to describe the molecular system. \\nThis force field then determines how each molecule reacts through using the forces between \\nmolecules based upon their interatomic potentials. The other portion of molecular dynamics are \\nthe trajectories of the molecules. These are calculated by solving the Newtonian equations of \\nmotion for each molecule. Both the three dimensional velocities and three dimensional positions \\nof each particle are taken into account for the calculations of these trajectories. Once the forces \\nand trajectories are calculated for every particle, the molecular dynamics program allows the \\nsimulation to take one time step. This time step then allows all the molecules in the system to \\nmove a small distance. The distance and the directions these molecules take is determined by the \\ntrajectory of the molecule from the previous step and the forces acting upon them. The \\nmovements of these molecules also needs to take into account the interactions it could take with \\nany other molecule in the system, such as collisions or repulsions. With every time step of these \\nsimulations we can calculate different properties that the system holds based upon the average \\nbehavior that all the molecules hold. These properties can include temperature and pressure of \\nthe system, kinetic energy, potential energy, total energy, structure factor, pair correlation \\nfunction, velocity autocorrelation function, and many more. With these properties, found with \\n   6 \\nmolecular dynamic simulations, we can predict how a particular system will behave before \\nrunning this system through a bench top experiment. Along with property prediction, molecular \\ndynamic simulations are used to determine why or how a molecule behaves in a certain manner.  \\nA particular set of software that is used to run molecular dynamic experiments is called \\nGROMACS24,25. GROMACS stands for GROningen Machine for Chemical Simulations and is a \\npackage that is downloaded free online for the use of simulating molecules. Particular to \\nGROMAS, this software is used to simulate organic molecules such as proteins, lipids, and \\nnucleic acids.  \\nWith GROMACS, we use another variety of online databases and software help in order to \\nrun our following simulations. The process of setting up our simulations in order to be run on \\nGROMACS can be found in the next few paragraphs.  \\nFirst, each of the eighteen Protein Data Bank (PDB) files of a molecular cage were \\nprepared. The PDB files were subsequently converted into a format that is applicable to \\nGROMACS using OBGMX26. This translation allowed for the implementation of the Universal \\nForce Field (UFF)27 to the generation of topology files (top) as well as the restraint files (itp). \\nThe PDB file was also duplicated on our server using GROMACS to create a structural file \\n(gro). The restraint file needed to be edited in order for the atom labels to match the structure \\nfile. From here, two different models of simulation were used: with and without solvent. In both \\ncases, the UFF is used to evolve the atomic trajectories. \\n For the simulations without solvent, the simulation box was generated using GROMAC \\nfor our system to be held in. The carbons for the molecular cage were numbered and a separate \\nrestraint file was created to limit the movement of these carbons. Energy minimization was run \\non the cages in order to conform to an appropriate geometry. After the minimization, a NVT \\n(Number of atoms, Volume, and Temperature) canonical equilibration process was run in order \\nto create a suitable environment for the cage to exist within. After equilibration, the restraint file \\nwas edited so that only a few carbons were held to their positions. This was done in order for us \\nto simulate the appropriate interactions of the cage arms within our system. This was also meant \\nto prevent the collapse of the cage due to the non-solvated environment we set up. Once the \\nsystem was equilibrated to the correct temperature, a production simulation was run on our \\nsystem for six nanoseconds. The first three being used as another equilibration phase while the \\nlast three were used for analysis. Once the production step had been run, we computed the \\n   7 \\ndistance between the two center of masses of the alkyne carbons on each arm. The total \\ntrajectory file for the final three nanoseconds of the simulation and the structure file were used to \\ncreate videos to monitor the cage’s movements using VMD.28 \\n For the simulations with explicit solvent, the number of chloroform molecules used as \\nsolvent for these simulations were based off the number of solvent molecules used per molecular \\ncage during the synthesis. This number was calculated based off of density of the solvent \\nmolecules and size of the simulation box per molecular cage. The chloroform topology file, \\nrestraint file, and structure file were all generated in the same fashion as the cage files. The \\nsimulation box was constructed using packmol29 to fill the box with the correct number of \\nchloroform solvent molecules. Position restraints for the carbons of the cage were generated and \\napplied similarly to the simulation without solvent. The energy minimization step was run on \\nboth the solvent and cage. For equilibration, first an NPT (Number of atoms, Pressure, and \\nTemperature) equilibration step was run to stabilize the pressure in the box environment for \\n100ps at the ambient pressure at 300 K. This process was followed by NVT equilibration for \\ntemperature fluctuation stability. After the equilibration, all the carbons of the system were \\nunconstrained for the production simulations. The production phase was run for a total of 4 \\nnanoseconds, the first nanosecond being used for equilibration and the last three nanoseconds for \\nanalysis. Distance calculations were run for the alkyne distances of interest similarly to the \\ncalculation run on the environment without solvent.  \\n We only recorded the intramolecular interactions for each of the transition cages leading \\nto the next cage along our desired path. Monitoring the intermolecular reactions between a \\nforming cage and other precursors would hold another level of challenges. In this work, we \\ndecided to only record the intramolecular interactions, because the large number of scenarios to \\nmonitor intermolecular interactions would be beyond the scope of this paper. \\nHerein, this paper uses classical molecular dynamic (MD) simulations to measure the \\nprobability of reaction for a POC precursor with varying arm lengths. Previous work used MD \\nsimulations to study the structure and flexibility of POCs30 as well as gas diffusion within pores \\nof MOFs.31 This paper also measures the reaction probability of the multiple arm length \\nprecursors at different key stages of the POC while transitioning to the desired product. MD \\nsimulations give a view of a dynamically evolving system of hundreds of atoms over a timescale \\n   8 \\nuseful for measuring reactions. MD simulations also allow for the ability to observe molecular \\ninteractions and measure useful properties of the system.  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n   9 \\nChapter 2 \\n \\nCages in Solvent \\n \\n Classical MD simulations allow for a longer timescale to capture events that are not \\nnormally viewable with ab initio calculation. Our computational approach used these MD \\nsimulations with GROMACS in order to predict the most likely state of equilibrium that each of \\nthe cages and intermediates are likely to maintain.  We then compare the different states of \\nequilibrium between the different length arms to determine which arm length is more likely to \\nreact into the next intermediate.  \\n We compare the possibility of reaction amongst the three intermediates by measuring the \\ndistance between the two alkyne carbons where we are expecting the reaction to take place. Once \\nwe measure the distance between the two alkynes bonds, it is then compared to the van der \\nWaals distance for two carbon atoms. By measuring the alkyne distance in comparison to the van \\nder Waals distance, we can get a prediction as to how likely a chemical reaction will take place. \\nWe continue under the assumption that if the distance between the two alkyne carbons was at or \\nless than the van der Waals distance, we would then assume that the reaction took place. \\nOpposed to that, if the measured distance was outside the van der Waals distance it was then \\nconsidered that the reaction did not take place. In the simulations with explicit solvent we used \\nthe van der Waals distance of 4.5 Å.  \\n The simulations with explicit solvent place 1,000 chloroform molecules, with the \\nmolecular cage of interest, into a 55 x 55x 55 Å3 cubic box. The NPT runs for 100,000 steps with \\nthe step size being 1 femtosecond, setting the box pressure to 1 atmosphere. The NVT \\nequilibration runs for 100,000 steps with the step size being 0.1 fs, setting the box temperature to \\n300 Kelvin. The production phase is run for 40,000,000 steps at 0.1 fs per step and analyzing \\nonly the final 30,000,000.  \\n   10 \\nFrom this point forward, when discussing the simulations taking place at each stage of \\nthe reaction, I refer to each of these stages as the intermediates of the overall reaction. These \\nintermediates take place between the initial precursor and the final cage.  \\nTo distinguish these intermediates from one another, we use the nomenclature [A-B-C]. \\nWhere A refers to the number of vertices (corners) within the intermediate, B refers to the \\nnumber of edges connecting each vertex, and C refers to the number of completed intermediate \\nfaces (sides) that contain no open bonds. \\n Our hypothesis for these molecular cage intermediates, based off of experimental results, \\nis that precursors with shorter arm lengths have higher probability to form the final cage.  \\n \\nFigure 1. Molecular configurations of molecular cages with short, Ps (a), medium, Pm (b), and long, Pl (c), \\narm lengths [4-5-2] intermediates from MD simulations with explicit solvent. (d) Schematic drawing. \\n \\nThe [4-5-2] molecular cages Ps, Pm, and Pl are shown in Figure 1 a-c. We can see that \\nthis intermediate has the least number of unconnected bonds, which allows for higher degrees of \\narm rotation and movement. The distance being measured is between the ends of the two open \\narms during the cage formation. With Figure 2a-b we can see the results from the distance \\ncomparison between these alkyne bonds for all three arm lengths. The distance between the \\nalkyne carbons is small on average for all three arms. We can see from the results that cage with \\nthe shortest arm length, Ps, has the largest distance, which is contrary to the original hypothesis \\nthat the shorter arms would have the shortest distance. To look into this unexpected result, our \\ntrajectory file showed that the molecular cage for Ps has bent inward and collapsed upon itself. \\nLeaving the alkyne lengths to have a much larger distance than in a normal configuration. The \\n(a) (b) (c)\\n(d)\\nPm PlPs\\n   11 \\nremaining lengths for Pm and Pl were within the van der Waals distance for a large amount of \\nthe time for the entire simulation.  \\nAlso, while the two alkyne bonds are within a reasonable distance from each other, it is \\nunlikely that any intermolecular reactions between these cage arms and another precursor would \\noccur. Not forming any intermolecular bonds is due to the fact that the arms are much closer to \\nthe body of the cage and it would be harder for other precursors to try and wedge between these \\ntwo alkyne groups. The average values for Ps, Pm, and Pl, shown in Table 1, reflect the graph in \\nFigure 1a with these values occurring above or below the van der Waals distance. Table 1 also \\nshows how Ps is less likely to form its alkyne bond. The percentage in range demonstrates that \\nthe Pm and Pl precursors are very likely to proceed to the next phase of the reaction scheme \\nwhile Ps is less likely. The standard deviations show that Pm and Pl are very well equilibrated in \\ntheir state during this simulation, while also showing some evidence that Ps may not be within a \\ntrue equilibrium state, given the deformation of the cage. Cage deformation is also shown in \\nFigure 1a from 2500 ps to 3000 ps of the Ps precursor can be seen going slightly out of \\nequilibrium.  \\n \\nFigure 2.

Molecular configurations of molecular cages with short, Ps (a), medium, Pm (b), and long, Pl (c), \\narm lengths [3-2-0] intermediates from MD simulations with explicit solvent. (d) Schematic drawing. \\n The [3-2-0] molecular intermediate, shown in Figure 3a-c, has fewer total atoms than the \\n[4-5-2] cage, but has the same number of alkyne bond distances being measured. The amount of \\nunrestrained movement that each arm of the cage can take is much more flexible in this [3-2-0] \\nintermediate than the [4-5-2] intermediate because the [3-2-0] is not as complete a structure. We \\ncan also see that this set of simulations favor the hypothesis for Ps, Pm, and Pl. The Ps arm \\nlength has the highest percentage of frames within the van der Waals distance, followed by Pm, \\nand then Pl. The number of oligomer side reactions happening with Pl is much more likely than \\nPs, since Ps is most likely to continue along the intended reaction mechanism. The average \\nvalues for Ps, Pm, and Pl in Table 2 show that the expected trend is consistent for these three \\nprecursors. The percent in range shows that the smaller precursor arm length is much more likely \\nto react into the next stage of the pathway. Continuing down Table 2, the standard deviation for \\nthese arms show that all three precursors are well equilibrated in the simulation environment and \\nthat these geometries are stable. \\n(a) (b) (c)\\n(d)\\nPs Pm Pl\\n   13 \\n \\nFigure 4.

To continue with the reaction \\nmechanism of interest, one or both of these bonds must be created. The creation of these bonds \\ncan become a challenge if the freedom of movement with the arms is high, allowing for twisting \\nof the free arms and side reactions to take place. From the results, Figure 6a-f, we can see that \\nthese simulations agree with our hypothesis when comparing the three arm lengths. The Pl arm \\nlengths are much further apart in distance than the Pm, and Ps is also much closer than Pm \\nrespectively. The average lengths and percentage of time within the van der Waals distance show \\nthat the Ps is much more likely to form the necessary bonds than the Pm and Pl. The Pm distance \\nresults show that, while being outside the van der Waals distance, the two alkynes being \\nmeasured in the Pm intermediate are more likely to form a bond than the two alkynes in the Pl \\nintermediate. The percentage of frames in range and averages for [4-4-1] show that it is unlikely \\nfor Pl and Pm to proceed with the next phase of the reaction while Ps can form one of the alkyne \\nbonds. The averages and graph from Figure 6a-c show that the distances increase as the arm \\nlengths get larger, as we expected. The standard deviations for each of the arms are high with the \\nexception of Ps2. This high standard deviation can indicate that these configurations of the \\ndifferent semi-formed cages are not quite in their equilibrium state and may require a longer \\nsimulation time, but the trend remains the same that Ps is more likely to react than Pm and in \\nturn Pl. \\n \\n   15 \\n \\nFigure 6.

Molecular configurations of molecular cages with short, Ps (a), medium, Pm (b), and long, Pl (c), \\narm lengths [4-3-0] intermediates from MD simulations with explicit solvent. (d) Schematic drawing. \\n \\n The [4-3-0] molecular cages have an even higher freedom of movement than the [4-4-1] \\ncage and the [4-5-2] cage. This intermediate has three pairs of bonds that are open to movement \\nand are recorded for distances, as seen in Figure 7a-c. Because the number of unreacted alkynes \\nis higher, so is the amount of rotational freedom that the arms have. This higher rotational \\nfreedom allows the alkynes to be more likely to move away from their reactive position. The \\nresults from the distance calculations show, Figure 8a-f, that despite the amount of freedom \\nhaving increased, the cage is contained within a certain configuration. We can see that the results \\nfor [4-3-0] run contrary to our predictions as well. While all the cages have at least one bond \\nwithin the van der Waals distance for a majority of the time, our predictions are off when it \\ncomes to assigning likelihood of reaction for Ps, Pm and Pl. For this cage, Pm is the most likely \\nto react followed by Pl and then Ps. The trajectory file for this cage showed that there is not \\nmuch that can be seen for an explanation as to why Ps is less likely to react than Pm and Pl. The \\ncage, again, appears to have its arms fold onto the cage and collapse, leading to a lower \\nequilibrated state than the original configuration. This lower state then causes the distances \\nbetween the alkyne bonds to be higher on average. From Table 4, the average alkyne distances \\nand percentage within range of the van der Waals distance can confirm that Ps is less likely than \\nPm and Pl to form bonds. The standard deviation of these distance values for the Ps system show \\nthat the system is not in equilibrium and is changing structure, shown also in Figure 10a after \\n1500 ps. \\n(a) (b) (c)\\n(d)\\nPs Pm Pl\\n   17 \\n \\n \\nFigure 8.

This side reaction is the \\nformation of a dimeric cage structure, which occurs by using only two precursors instead of four. \\nWe took a look at this side reaction to see how likely it is to occur as compared to the main \\nreaction. \\n   18 \\n \\n \\nFigure 9. Molecular configurations of molecular cages with short, Ps (a), medium, Pm (b), and long, Pl (c), \\narm lengths [2-1-0] intermediates from MD simulations with explicit solvent. (d) Schematic drawing. \\n The dimeric cage begins by creating two connections between two of the precursors. As \\nseen in Figure 9a-c this is what we’re measuring for with the [2-1-0] cage simulations. As seen \\nby the results, in Figure 10a-f, we have a similar pattern to our main pathway results. The Pl \\nholds the longer distances, followed by Pm, and then Ps having the shortest distances. We \\nexpected to see much closer distances with the Pl arms because of their freedom to move closer \\ntogether and possible overlap, but when we reviewed this in our trajectory file, the free alkyne \\narms move away from each other and hold their relaxed positions. The percentage that these \\nalkyne bonds are within range of a reaction are zero percent across the board for all bonds, \\nshown in Table 5. Solely based off of these simulations we would not have a reaction occur, \\nespecially at the larger arm lengths. The fact that no reactions would occur is contrary to what is \\nshown in experiments. The standard deviations shown in Table 5 inform us that the structure is \\nwell equilibrated and must be within an energy minimum well.  \\n(a) (b) (c)\\n(d)\\nPs Pm Pl\\n   19 \\n \\nFigure 10.

(d) Schematic drawing. \\n \\n The second phase of the dimeric reaction is to have the third and final arm react in order \\nto complete the structure. Figure 11a-c show the structure of [2-2-1] cage intermediate. The \\nresults from the distances for these intermediates, Figure 12a-b, are interesting because they \\nshow something contrary to our experimental results as well as not following along with the \\nresults from the [2-1-0] intermediate. None of the alkyne carbons were close enough in distance \\nto create a bond, but also all of the arm lengths have relatively the same distances. These results \\nrun against the evidence we have from experiments, where the Pl and Pm precursors form \\ndimeric structures along with the tetrameric version. These simulation results may be due to the \\nlimitations of the MD simulations that we used for this experiment. The force field used could \\nmimic tetrameric formation more favorably than the dimeric formation. Or possibly the MD \\nsimulation did not run for a long enough time to allow for the structure to escape from an energy \\nminimum. In either case, the results show that the average lengths of Ps are shorter than Pm, \\nwhich is in turn shorter than Pl. Table 6 confirms that none of the bonds come within range of a \\nreaction at all, and that the averages for all three precursors are relatively the same distance. \\nThese close averages are good for Pl and Pm to be closer or as close as Ps. Because by arm \\nlength alone the Ps has a smaller distance to clear in order to form a bond between the alkynes. \\nThe equilibrated structures for Pm and Pl are closer to forming a dimer than the [2-1-0] \\nstructures. We can also see that, based off the standard deviation, these structures are well \\nequilibrated as well. However, the fact that the distances are so far off from the van der Waals \\n(a) (b) (c)\\n(d)\\nPs Pm Pl\\n   21 \\ndistance for reaction to occur means that our simulations run counter to the experimental results \\nwith [2-2-1] as well.  \\n \\n \\nFigure 12.

Initially the cages collapsed due to the \\nnon-solvated environment. This collapse prompted us to add in constraints on a small selection \\nof carbon atoms. These constraints were added in order to maintain the structure of the cage \\nthroughout the simulation. The carbon atoms being constrained were picked so that they did not \\ninhibit the mobility of the free alkyne arms. The simulations without solvent were eventually \\nreplaced by the solvent simulations to better mimic the experimental environment. These \\nsimulations were also replaced because of the lack of equilibrium structure that the molecule \\nmaintained. The solvent simulations were much more radical and free moving with the alkyne \\narms than the solvent simulations. This can be because of the increased energy needed to \\ndisplace the solvent molecules that are blocking the arms of the cage. \\n The first simulation without solvent is the [4-5-2] cage. The configuration for the [4-5-2] \\ncage can be seen in the previous Figure 1a-c, the simulation without solvent is the same \\nexcluding the solvent molecules. We can see, in Figure 13a-b below, that the fluctuations of our \\narms for this cage is much larger than the same cage in solvent. All three of the arm lengths for \\nthis cage’s lone alkyne measurement are outside of the van der Waals distance a majority of the \\ntime. Pl and Ps come nowhere close to the distance for the alkyne bonds to interact. The Pm cage \\ndoes have a brief period between 1000 ps and 2000 ps that shows a stabilization in the arm pairs \\nat a very close distance. This also could likely be attributed to our equilibration not running for \\nlong enough in this simulation, but it could also be a brief dip into an energy well for a stabilized \\ndistance. Shown in Table 7 is the data for the percentage of time that each of the cage arm \\nlengths spends within the range of the van der Waals distance. This is the highest for Pm, \\n   23 \\nfollowed by Ps and then Pl. The case for Pm having the highest percentage within range is \\nbecause of the uncanny stabilization that we see in Figure 13a. Judging from the rest of the \\nsimulation for Pm, the alkyne distance does not dip into range very often, showing that this is an \\nanomaly from the average. The averages for the three arms are all outside of the van der Waals \\nrange meaning that none of them are likely to react. The standard deviation for all of the bonds is \\nhigh, indicating that these intermediates are less stabilized than their solvent counterparts. \\nHowever, this is also due to the fact that the arms for the cages are allowed to range over a larger \\nenergy landscape than in the solvent reaction. \\n  \\n \\nFigure 13.

The distances between the two alkyne \\narms, shown in Figure 14a-b, are over a much broader range of distances than its explicit solvent \\ncounterparts. As shown in Figure 14a-b, the general trend that we predicted from experiments \\nwith our collaborator is shown here. The Ps arm length is shorter in distance than the Pm and Pl \\narm lengths. For these simulations, the Ps is within the van der Waals range a large percentage of \\nthe time, see Table 8, and can be considered likely to react to the next stage of the cage \\nformation. However Pm and Pl do not appear to be close enough to react at all. The average \\ndistances reflect this fact. The standard deviations for arms are higher than their solvent \\nsimulation counterparts as well. Again, due to the free range for not having solvent molecules, \\nand being allowed to sample over a larger energy landscape, the Ps and Pm have lower standard \\ndeviations compared to the Pl arm. This fact can explain how the Pl has a larger percentage \\nwithin the van der Waals range compared to Pm because the Pl arm fluctuates wildly between \\ndistances lower than 5 Å and above 10 Å.  \\n \\nFigure 14.

The results for the simulation of [4-4-1] cage are in Figure 15a-c. This shows us \\nthat the general trend between Ps, Pm, and Pl results back up our earlier stated hypothesis well. \\nThe Ps arm length is lower than Pm and in turn lower than Pl. Given the trace shown in Figure \\n15a-c, we can see that the system is equilibrated and ranges over its energy surface without being \\nstuck in any energy wells. This also shows a trend that at least one of the arms, of the two being \\nmeasured, has a higher percentage within the van der Waals range than the other arm. We \\nviewed this in our trajectory files and noticed that one of the arms taking precedence over the \\nother. This could be in order to allow one arm to react in this cage, the other arm must go out of \\nits own reaction space in order to give a favorable position for another arm. Since this structure is \\nsymmetric, we can say that it does not matter which arm is taking precedence over the other, just \\nthat the trend is taking place. The average arm lengths, Table 9, for the Ps, Pm, and Pl show us \\nthe trend that we predicted with our collaborators, and it also shows the trend that we predict \\nwith one arm beating out the other arm in the system.

As shown in Figure 16a-c, we have the Ps cage showing a smaller \\ndistance between all three of its alkyne bond formation distances versus the three Pm bonds. The \\nthree Pm arms are also shown to have a smaller distance than the Pl arms respectively. The \\n   27 \\nequilibration for all nine of these arms is shown to be less equilibrated than the previous \\nsimulations without solvent. It can be gathered that each of the cages go in and out of lower \\nenergy states, as seen in Figure 16b with Pm. The percentage values in Table 10 correspond well \\nwith what we can gather in Figure 16. Showing that all three Ps distances are closer together for \\na much longer time than Pm and Pl. We can expect the Ps intermediate is more likely to continue \\non with the reaction as compared to the other two bond distances. The average values show that \\none bond is more likely than the others to react initially, much like how the reaction for [4-4-1] \\nworked mechanically. The standard deviations for the are all within the normal values seen in the \\nsimulations without solvent. With the exception of the Pm cage having a much lower standard \\ndeviation as compared to the rest of our simulations without solvent.  \\n \\n \\nFigure 16.

We are then measuring the other two arms of each precursor to determine if the \\nalkyne bonds will form an intramolecular bond. With the [2-1-0] intermediate, looking at Figure \\n9a-c we can see that in our simulations without solvent, Figure 17a-f, these simulations allow for \\nmuch closer contact between the alkyne bonds we’re monitoring. From what we can see in \\nFigure 17a-c, and the percentage under the van der Waals distance in Table 11, there is a very \\nsmall difference between Ps, Pm, and Pl arm lengths. The Ps arm length has both of its arms at a \\nclose distance, while Pm and Pl have only one arm at a close distance and one arm far away. \\nThis could be an extension of the behavior seen from the previous tetrameric cages, where one \\narm is allowed to maintain a minimum distance at the sacrifice of the other arm. Looking at the \\naverage distances and the standard deviations in Table 11 we can see that the closer of the two \\nbond distances has a much smaller standard deviation than the other bond distance. Showing that \\nthere is some stability being reached and allowed to maintain a minimum energy. We can also \\nsee, with Figure 17a and c, that the Ps and Pl arm length intermediates have not quite reached an \\nenergy minimum. Ps has clear spikes in distances meaning that it is still equilibrating somewhat. \\nWhile Pl has the same problem but to a lower extent. These spikes in distances mean that, given \\nour averages, what we see is probably the behavior of our system. If given a lengthier simulation \\nwill be able to confirm these configurations. Not much can be concluded about the theory of Pl \\nbeing closer than Pm for this simulation. This is due to all the results for the three cages being \\nvery close to each other. The conclusion that the Pm and Pl arm lengths are both more likely than \\nthe Ps arm length to form the dimeric cage based off the distances, which is good for our \\n   29 \\nproposed theory. But determining the difference between Pm and Pl is slim. What we can see is \\nthat Pm has a higher probability to form both bonds than the Pl cage.  \\n \\n \\nFigure 17.

This intermediate can be seen in \\nFigure 10a-c. We are only monitoring the last alkyne bond that needs to be formed for the \\ndimeric cage to complete. In Figure 18a-b we can see the results from the simulations of the \\nthree arm length cages. In the figure we can see that Ps and Pm are both lower in distance than \\nthe Pl arm length, and this can be confirmed in Table 12. Table 12 shows that the average \\ndistance for Ps and Pm are actually equal. The only difference between the two being the \\nstandard deviation of the Pm cage is slightly lower than the Ps cage. The only conclusion we can \\nestablish off this is that the Pm cage is in a more stable state than the Ps, which means that it’ll \\nspend more time in this configuration. While the Ps distance fluctuates closer to a shorter \\ndistance in order to form a bond.  \\n \\n \\nFigure 18.

Both of our \\nsimulations, with and without solvent, show that the shorter arm length precursors are more \\nlikely to form the final product than the longer arm length precursors. The shortest arm length \\nprecursor, Ps, is able to form the final tetrameric cage more efficiently than the other two arm \\nlengths, because the distances for the two free alkyne arms are closer in contact with each other \\nfor the Ps than they are Pm and Pl. Hence the intermediate structures favor the shorter length \\narms when continuing along the main mechanistic reaction pathway. It is also shown that the Pm \\narm lengths favors slightly better than the Pl arm lengths. This work is useful to help design \\nfuture porous organic cages with desired structures and cut back on the Edisonian trial-and-error \\nexperimental approach. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n   32 \\nReferences \\n \\n(1) Martin, M; Gasparini, G; Graziani, M; Prins, L.

Creation of these small porous cage molecules is challenging because there is no consistent method to synthesize them in organic solvents. Harnessing the congregation capabilities of the cage-precursors in a systematically predictable fashion remains largely empirical. Herein, we use molecular dynamics simulation to predict the likelihood for the self-assembled cage-precursors to advance through each stage of the reaction. We found that with varying arm lengths of the organic precursor, precursors with shorter arm length are statistically more likely to complete these synthetic reactions. This knowledge is useful to guide the design of precursors for synthesizing new porous cages with desired structure.</dc:description><dc:date>\\n2018-03-13T15:49:13Z</dc:date><dc:date>\\n2018-03-13T15:49:13Z</dc:date><dc:date>\\n2017-12-11</dc:date><dc:date>\\n2017-12</dc:date><dc:type>\\nText</dc:type><dc:type>\\ntext</dc:type><dc:identifier>\\nhttp://hdl.handle.net/2142/99413</dc:identifier><dc:language>\\nen</dc:language><dc:rights>\\nCopyright 2017 Wade Fuerste</dc:rights><dc:format>\\napplication/pdf</dc:format>\\n</oai_dc:dc>\\n</metadata></record>',\n",

materials \\nPorous materials are important in a wide range of applications such as catalysis, \\nseparations, and energy storage.\\n1\\n They can be divided into the following groups \\naccording to their pore size: macroporous materials with pore sizes larger than 50 nm; \\nmesoporous materials with pore sizes between 2 and 50 nm; microporous materials \\nwith pore sizes less than 2 nm.\\n2\\n The main focus of this thesis is to evaluate new \\nmaterials for H2, N2, CH4, and CO2 storage and the associated gas selectivity. The \\ntarget set by the US Department of Energy (DOE) for H2 storage is not less than 45 \\nmmol g\\n-1\\n (9 wt %) by 2015 at room temperature.\\n3\\n Unfortunately, as yet, porous \\nmaterials have not achieved this target. The DOE defines the CH4 storage target as \\n180 v/v under 35 bar and ambient temperature.\\n4\\n Some activated carbons have \\nachieved CH4 storage values of up to 200 v/v.\\n5\\n CO2 emissions from fossil fuel \\ncombustion and power plants are a global environmental problem. Thus CO2 capture \\nand storage (CCS) is a key issue and challenge. Potential materials for CCS need not \\nonly to adsorb a large amount of CO2, but also to separate CO2 from a mixture of \\nother gases.\\n1a\\n \\nThe main classes of porous materials are crystalline and amorphous materials. \\nCrystalline porous materials are in general better understood because the structures \\nof the materials can be determined by X-ray diffractions. In contrast, amorphous \\nporous materials are difficult to characterize due to lack of periodic structure.\\n1b\\n There \\nare several well-known classes of microporous materials including zeolites,\\n6\\n \\nactivated carbons,\\n7\\n covalent organic frameworks (COFs),\\n8\\n metal-organic frameworks \\n(MOFs),\\n9\\n polymers of intrinsic microporosity (PIMs),\\n10\\n conjugated microporous \\npolymers (CMPs),\\n11\\n and porous organic molecules.\\n12\\n This thesis will focus on the \\ndesign the synthesis of porous organic molecules in either a crystalline or amorphous \\nsolid state. \\n \\nIntroduction \\n3 \\n \\n1.2 Porous frameworks \\n1.2.1 Metal organic frameworks (MOFs) \\nMetal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have received considerable attention over the last \\ndecade due to their interesting pore structures, chemical diversity, and potential \\napplications in various fields such as gas storage, separation, shape/size selectivity, \\ncatalysis, sensors and drug delivery.\\n13\\n MOFs have extended crystalline structures, \\ncontaining metal clusters and organic ligands. One-, two- and three- dimensional \\nstructures (1D, 2D and 3D, respectively) are formed by linking metal sites and \\norganic ligands, where the dimensionality can be controlled by the connectivity and \\ngeometry of the secondary building blocks. More importantly, due to the large \\nnumber of choices of both metal clusters and organic linkers, the number of potential \\nstructures of MOFs is vast. The concept of ‘reticular chemistry’ was proposed by \\nYaghi and O’Keeffe to design and construct porous MOFs materials by using \\nsecondary building units (SBUs).\\n14\\n A large number of topologies results from linking \\nvarious molecular ligands and metal clusters. By choosing appropriate building \\nblocks and synthetic methods, MOFs with well-defined pore sizes, shapes and \\nfunctionalities can be formed that result in desired properties. One of most \\nwell-known 3D MOFs is MOF-5, consisting of zinc clusters and 1,4 \\nbenzenedicarboxylate (BDC) that generate a cubic extended porous structure \\nreported by the Yaghi group that can be used for hydrogen storage.\\n15\\n MOF-5 adsorbs \\n22.5 mmol g\\n-1\\n (4.5 wt %) H2 at 78 K and 20 bar. A number of analogues of MOF-5, \\nIRMOFs (IsoReticular MOFs), have been investigated using different organic linkers \\nas shown in Figure 1.\\n9\\n To date, MOFs have demonstrated high porosity, for example, \\nMOF-201 has Brunauer−Emmet−Teller (BET) and Langmuir surface areas of 6240 \\nand 10400 m\\n2\\n/g, respectively.\\n16\\n High values of H2 storage have been achieved within \\nMOFs such as MOF-177 (37.5 mmol g\\n-1\\n which corresponds to 7.5 wt% at 70 bar, 77 \\nK) \\n17\\n and NOTT-112 (50 mmol g\\n-1\\n which corresponds to 10 wt% at 77 bar, 77 K).\\n18\\n \\nFor CH4 storage, IRMOF-6 has a CH4 uptake of 10.7 mmol g\\n-1\\n (155 v/v) at 298 K \\nand 36 atm.\\n19\\n MOF-177 has a CO2 storage capacity of up to 33.5 mmol g\\n-1\\n at room \\nIntroduction \\n4 \\n \\ntemperature and pressures up to 42 bar.\\n20\\n The uptake of CO2 in MIL-101 has reached \\na capacity of 40 mmol g\\n−1\\n at 5 MPa and 303 K.\\n21\\n MOFs also selectively adsorb and \\nseparate H2 over other gases, CO2 over N2, CO2 over CH4, xylene and alkane \\nisomers.\\n13, 22\\n Although MOFs possesses flexible structures, high surface areas and \\nlarge pore volumes, some of them show low thermal or hydrolytic stabilities, and \\npore structures can collapse after desolvation. \\n22-23\\n \\n \\nFigure 1. A series of IRMOFs with different functional organic linkers. The yellow \\nspheres represent the internal voids. The extended organic linker increases the \\ninternal void and it also allows the formation of catenated structure. (Figure taken \\nfrom the Ref.\\n9\\n) \\n1.2.2 Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) \\nCovalent Organic Frameworks (COFs) are a class of purely organic crystalline \\nporous materials. 2D layered structures or 3D networks can be constructed by strong \\ncovalent bonds between B, C, O and Si atoms. COF-1 was synthesized by the \\nself-condensation reaction of 1,4-benzenediboronic acid (BDBA) itself which \\nproduced a staggered layer framework linked by planar boroxine rings, B3O3 (Figure \\nIntroduction \\n5 \\n \\n2b).\\n8\\n COF-5 was synthesized by the condensation reaction of 1,4-benzenediboronic \\nacid (BDBA) and hexahydroxy triphenylene (HHTP), giving an eclipsed framework \\nstructure (Figure 2b).\\n8\\n COF-1 and COF-5 show apparent surface areas of 711 and \\n1590 m\\n2\\n/g, respectively.\\n8\\n These materials exhibit high thermal stability up to 600 °C, \\nbut rather low hydrolytic stability in some cases. Furthermore, a series of 3D COFs \\nwere reported by self-condensation and co-condensation reactions of the rigid \\nmolecular building blocks, tetrahedral (tetra(4-dihydroxyborylphenyl)methane, \\nTBPM and its silicon analogue TBPS ) and triangular (HHTP) monomers shown in \\nFigure 2a.\\n24\\n The 3D COFs (Figure 2c) exhibit very low crystal densities (0.17 g/cm\\n3\\n \\nfor COF-108) and high porosities (BET surface area of 4210 m\\n2\\n/g for COF-103).\\n24\\n \\nCOFs have lower densities than MOFs and the low densities coupled with large pore \\nvolumes in 3D COFs result in their higher gas uptakes. Some of the COFs have \\nshown very high CH4 storage capacities. The CH4 sorption capacity of COF-1 is 2.5 \\nmmol g\\n-1\\n (195 v/v) at 298 K and 35 bar, which has exceeded the US CH4 storage \\ntarget.\\n25\\n Simulations of H2 adsorption isotherms for COFs suggest that COF-105 and \\nCOF-108 reveal high H2 storage capacities.\\n26\\n The predicted H2 uptake is 50 mmol g\\n-1\\n \\n(10 wt %) at 77K and 80 bar for COF-105 and 50 mmol g\\n-1\\n (10 wt %) at 77 K and \\n100 bar for COF-108.  \\n \\n \\n \\nIntroduction \\n6 \\n \\n \\nFigure 2.

The ‘cost’ of irreversible chemistry is that the materials are amorphous, \\nnot crystalline, but benefit is that these solids can show significantly better physical \\nstability in some cases. Polymers of intrinsic microporosity (PIMs) have rigid, \\ncontorted structures and a large amount of interconnected free volume is created by \\nthe inefficient packing of polymer chains reported by McKeown and Budd.\\n27\\n PIMs \\ncan be prepared either as insoluble networks or, uniquely, as soluble linear polymers. \\nMost PIMs are synthesized by a highly efficient dibenzodioxane-forming reaction \\nusing a spirobisindane monomer and an o-dihalide monomer. The first PIM networks \\nwere prepared based on porphyrins and phthalocyanines.\\n28,29\\n The porphyrin-based \\nCOF-1\\nCOF-5\\nCOF-102 COF-105 COF-108\\n2D-COFs\\n3D-COFsBDBA HHTP\\nTBPM (X = C)\\nTBPS (X = Si)\\nA.\\nB.\\nC.\\n(a) (b)\\n(c)\\nIntroduction \\n7 \\n \\nPIMs exhibit large surface areas of 900-1000 m\\n2 \\ng\\n-1\\n.\\n29\\n PIMs containing Zn\\n2+\\n, Cu\\n2+\\n, \\nCo\\n2+\\n and 2H\\n+ \\ncenters are synthesized by the phthalocyanie formation reaction which \\nhave surface areas of 450-950 m\\n2 \\ng\\n-1\\n.\\n28\\n Furthermore, the PIM networks were \\nsynthesized containing hexaazatrinaphthalyene (HATN) for catalyst support,\\n30\\n with \\ncyclotricatechylene (CTC) for hydrogen storage,\\n31\\n and with \\n9,10-diethyl-2,3,6,7,12,13-hexahydroxytriptycene (Trip), showing a high surface \\narea of 1065 m\\n2\\n/g. \\n32\\n The molecular repeated units for PIMs are shown in Figure 3. \\nSoluble linear PIMs have a BET surface area of up to 850 m\\n2\\ng\\n-1\\n.\\n10\\n The structures of \\nsoluble PIM-1 and PIM-7 are shown in Figure 3. A significant advantage of these \\nmaterials is their solution processability. PIM-1 film can be cast from solution and \\nPIM membranes have shown high permeability and gas separation such as for \\nO2/N2.\\n27, 33\\n It is noted that soluble liner PIMs with low molecular weight chains have \\nlow surface areas and the porosity increases with increasing chain length. For \\nexample, PIM-4 with molecular weight of 5.0 x 10\\n3\\n g mol\\n-1 \\nshows a BET surface \\narea of 440 m\\n2\\n g\\n-1\\n, while PIM-1 with molecular weight of 2.7 x 10\\n5\\n g mol\\n-1\\n shows a \\nBET surface area of 750 m\\n2\\n g\\n-1\\n.\\n10, 27\\n  \\nIntroduction \\n8 \\n \\n \\nFigure 3.

The micropore \\nsize distributions and surface areas of these materials can be tuned by varying the \\nlength of the organic linkers, even though the materials are amorphous.\\n11, 35\\n Gas \\nsorption analysis reveals that the shortest strut length gives rise to the smallest pore \\nsize and highest micropore volume and surface area (such as CMP-0). In contrast, the \\nlargest strut length results in the largest pore size, but the lowest micropore volume \\nIntroduction \\n9 \\n \\nand surface area (such as CMP-5). Atomistic simulations suggest that short rigid \\nstruts have low flexibility between the struts and adjacent connected benzene \\nnodes.\\n35\\n The lower interpenetration in CMP-0 gives rise to a higher porosity.\\n35\\n \\nCMP-5 has the longest struts and hence there is more geometric interpenetration.\\n35\\n \\nThe flexibility of the network makes the packing closer that reduces the porosity.\\n35\\n \\nMany applications using CMPs have been investigated in the last few years. For \\nexample, metal-CMPs containing rhenium, rhodium and iridium have been designed \\nfor heterogeneous catalysis.\\n36\\n Moreover, metalloporphyrin CMP possesses a surface \\narea of 1270 m\\n2\\n g\\n-1\\n and can be used as a heterogeneous catalyst for the oxidation of \\nvarious sulfides with up to 99 % selectivity and 98 % conversion.\\n37\\n CMPs based on \\npyrene building blocks have shown high luminescence and emission colour.\\n38\\n \\nPolyphenylene CMPs (PP-CMPs) has been reported for light harvesting.

In brief, the approach is to pack discrete molecules \\nwith the packing dictated by weak van der Waals forces, so that porosity can be \\ngenerated in either the amorphous or the crystalline solid state. However, most \\norganic molecules pack efficiently with minimal void volume and are generally \\nnonporous.\\n12\\n Solvated organic molecular solids may have cavities or channels where \\nsolvents molecules are situated. Upon desolvation, however, these voids usually \\ncollapse and hence permanently porous organic molecules are comparatively rare \\nwith respect to porous networks or frameworks.\\n12\\n  \\nIt is worth defining of the term ‘porosity’ for porous molecules. In general, porosity \\nIntroduction \\n13 \\n \\ncan be divided into intrinsic and extrinsic porosity.\\n44\\n Intrinsic pores arise from the \\nintrinsic voids in a molecule, whereas extrinsic pores result from inefficient \\nmolecular packing.\\n44\\n Some porous molecules exhibit both intrinsic and extrinsic \\nporosity. A review by Barbour described three distinct categories of porosity: \\nconventional porosity, porosity ‘without pores’, and virtual porosity.44 Conventional \\nporosity is generated by permanent voids or channels in the materials. The \\nconventional porosity of a material can be measured either experimentally by gas \\nadsorption analysis or computationally by rolling a probe around the surface of the \\npores, which is dependent on the radius of the probe. The typical probe radii are 1.82 \\nÅ for N2 probe, 1.72 Å for CO2 probe and 1.42 Å for H2 probe.\\n45\\n Porosity ‘without \\npores’ is used to describe materials without channels or voids in the structures which, \\nhowever, are still accessible to a guest molecule.\\n44\\n For example, \\np-tert-butylcalix[4]arene does not have connected channels in the static crystal \\nstructure, but guest molecules can nonetheless diffuse in the lattice voids by a \\ndynamic process.\\n46\\n Virtual porosity is not a class of porosity, but rather the result of \\nvisualizing the structure using the capped-stick or ball-and-stick display style. This \\nkind of ‘porosity’ disappears when using a space-filling display style.44 Virtual \\nporosity also can be created by artificially deleting solvents in the structure, but this \\nassumes that the structure will not rearrange upon desolvation, which is not typically \\nthe case.\\n44\\n  \\nThere have been a number of reports of organic molecules that pack inefficiently in \\nthe solid state and which are stable to desolvation, thus forming permanently porous \\nmolecular crystals such as calixarenes,\\n47\\n cucurbit[6]uril,\\n48\\n some dipeptides,\\n49\\n \\n3,3’,4,4’-tetra(trimethylsilylethynyl) biphenyl,50 and imine-based organic cages.43a In \\ncomparison to many conventional microporous materials, porous organic molecules \\nhave potential advantages due to their good solution processability and functional \\ngroup modification.\\n12, 43a\\n These porous organic molecules have desirable properties \\nfor gas storage, molecular separations and catalysis. In the following section, the \\nvarious classes of porous molecules will be introduced in more detail.  \\nIntroduction \\n14 \\n \\n1.4.1 Calixarenes \\nCalix[n]arenes are a class of macrocyclic compounds that are useful building blocks \\nin supramolecular chemistry.\\n51\\n The molecules possess a bowl-shaped conformation \\nwith defined upper and lower rims (Figure 7) and the cavity of calixarenes can be \\nused to accommodate guest molecules.\\n51\\n Calixarenes are generally formed via a \\nphenol-formaldehyde condensation reaction.\\n52\\n Various calix[n]arenes derivatives \\nhave been synthesized by modifying functionality either at the upper or lower rim. \\n53\\n \\nThe simplest representative of calix[n]arenes is calix[4]arene (Figure 7).\\n47\\n \\nCalix[4]arene is observed to incorporate methane and freon molecules in the \\ninterstitial voids forming highly stable host-guest systems.\\n47\\n  \\n      \\nFigure 7.

(b) A representative collapsed cage obtained from the final \\nconfiguration of a 10 ns NPT MD simulation of a desolvated CC7 cell. (Figure \\nadapted from Ref.\\n75c\\n)  \\nCC9 and CC10 cage molecules with bulky aryl groups attached to the vertices have \\nbeen reported (Figure 25).\\n75b\\n The vertex functionality enhanced the extrinsic porosity, \\nand a polymorph study was carried out for these cage molecules. These materials \\nhave high gas uptakes.  \\n \\nFigure 25. Imine reaction for the [4 + 6] Schiff-base condensation yielding CC9 (X = \\nH) and CC10 (X = F) cage molecules. (Figure taken from the Ref.\\n75b\\n) \\nA series of amorphous scrambled cage molecules has also been synthesized. These \\namorphous cage molecules show high level of porosities (BET surface areas up to \\na b\\nIntroduction \\n34 \\n \\n898 m\\n2\\n g\\n-1\\n) and gas selectivity can be tuned by the cage functionality. Chapters 5 and \\n6 describe an experimental and molecular dynamic study on these amorphous cage \\nmaterials.  \\n1.5.4 Zhang research group \\nZhang and his co-workers have synthesized a shape-persistent organic cage molecule \\nin a [2+3] cycloimination reaction.\\n79\\n This cage molecule has a very small internal \\nvoid and the packing diagram shows that the molecules close pack to each other in a \\nlayered structure form (Figure 26). The crystalline [2+3] cage material showed a low \\ngas uptake of CO2 and H2 at 1 bar and 20 ºC. The gas uptake of CO2 was 0.19 mmol \\ng\\n-1\\n, whereas the material hardly adsorbed N2 (0.0027 cm\\n3 \\ng\\n-1\\n). However, the material \\ndisplayed a high ideal CO2/N2 (CO2/N2 = 73/1 (mmol/mmol)) adsorption selectivity \\nat 1 bar and 20 ºC. In addition, the imine reduction reaction for the cage molecule \\nwas carried out. The CO2/N2 adsorption selectivity for the amine cage material at 1 \\nbar and 20 ºC decreased to 39/1(mmol/mmol). The authors suggested that the good \\ngas selectivity can be attributed to the well-defined pore structure and the strong \\ninteraction of CO2 with the imine groups of the cage molecules, although in reality \\nthe selectivity must be considered in the context of the capacity, as pointed out in a \\npublication arising from my own work.\\n23a\\n \\n \\nFigure 26. (a) Crystal packing of [2+3] cage molecules. The 1D channels are shown \\nusing an orange Connolly surface (probe radius of 1.82 Å). (b) CO2 and N2 \\nadsorption isotherms at 20 °C and 2 bar. (Figure taken from the Ref.\\n79\\n) \\na\\nb\\nIntroduction \\n35 \\n \\nThe same research group also reported a series of related [2+3] cage compounds with \\ndifferent sizes of internal cavities that exhibited ideal CO2/N2 selectivity in the range \\nfrom 36/1 (mmol/mmol) to 138/1 (mmol/mmol) at 20 ºC and 1 bar.\\n80\\n Although the \\nactual CO2 adsorption capacity of these [2+3] cage molecules at 1 bar and 20 ºC is \\nmuch lower than other organic molecules published, the selectivity is extraordinarily \\nhigh, although errors may be substantial when gas capacities become this low. \\nMoreover, a series of organic cage frameworks were reported by Zhang and \\ncoworkers with ideal gas selectivities for CO2/N2 of up to 213/1 (mmol/mmol) at 1 \\nbar and 20 ºC. \\n1.6 Aims of this PhD project \\nMy PhD project aims to synthesize and simulate crystalline and amorphous porous \\norganic cages for potential applications in gas storage and separation. The cage \\nmolecules are synthesized in a simple one-step cycloimination reaction by various \\ntrialdehyde and diamine monomers. The molecules pack in the solid state by weak \\nwan der Waals interactions. The porosity in these materials is due to both the intrinsic \\nmolecular voids and extrinsic voids from inefficient packing. First, I aim to \\ninvestigate that the effect of functional groups on the cage vertices on the porosity of \\nthe crystalline cage materials. Next I will attempt to design crystalline cage \\nmolecules that are capable of selective guest binding for gas separation. Furthermore, \\namorphous cage molecules will be also investigated. I will study the gas selectivity \\nin these materials and how to tune the properties by modifying reaction conditions or \\nintroducing functionality in the cages.  \\nOn the basis of the materials obtained by synthesis, molecular simulations will be \\nused to rationalize the properties and understand molecular packing. In particular \\nwith respect to gas selectivity, molecular dynamics are carried out to simulate gas \\ndiffusion properties. For the amorphous cage materials, a simulation methodology is \\nused to generate amorphous cage models. This method will be applicable to structure \\ngeneration of other classes of amorphous molecules. In the future, I hope it can be \\nIntroduction \\n36 \\n \\nused to predict properties of other amorphous cage molecules and related molecular \\nmaterials. \\n1.7 References \\n \\n1.

The main \\nexperimental characterization techniques used in this thesis are gas sorption, X-ray \\ndiffraction (XRD), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), Fourier transform infrared \\nspectroscopy (FTIR), scanning electron microscope (SEM), high performance liquid \\nchromatography (HPLC), mass spectrometry (MS), and nuclear magnetic resonance \\nspectroscopy (NMR). Generally, gas sorption analysis is used to measure gas uptake, \\nsurface area, pore size distribution, and pore volume of porous solids. XRD has been \\nperformed to determine the crystal structure and phase purity of materials. TGA \\nprovides information about the decomposition temperature and solvent loss of \\nmaterials. The morphology of materials can be observed by SEM. MS is an \\nanalytical technique to measure the accurate molecular weight of a compound. HPLC \\nis used to indentify molecular mass distributions for mixtures of compounds and to \\npurify each component in the mixture. NMR and IR techniques are important tools \\nfor determining molecular structures.  \\nMolecular simulation is an alternative approach to characterize porous materials in \\nmicroscopically scope. It has been widely used to rationalize materials properties and, \\nless often, to design new materials with particular properties. Calculation techniques \\nused in the thesis include density functional theory (DFT), molecular dynamics (MD), \\nforce fields, and energy minimization. Some basic theoretical backgrounds will be \\ndiscussed in detail here. \\n2.2 Gas adsorption \\nGas adsorption is used to describe a surface phenomenon where gas molecules are \\nintroduced and bound to a solid surface.\\n1\\n As shown in Figure 1, the solid is called the \\nadsorbent and the gas is referred to as the adsorbate. Porous materials are often used \\npractically as adsorbents. The analysis is widely used to estimate the surface area, \\npore size, and pore volume of porous materials. The adsorption process can be \\nclassified into two categories: physical adsorption (physisorption) and chemical \\nadsorption (chemisorption), depending on the strength of the interaction between the \\nadsorbate and the adsorbent.\\n2\\n Some features have been used to distinguish between \\nphysisorption and chemisorption. For chemisorption, a chemical bond is formed \\nExperimental and computational methods  \\n45 \\n \\nbetween adsorbate and adsorbent which leads to a non-reversible process. The \\nadsorption process is limited to a single layer (monolayer) formation of adsorbates \\non the surface. \\nPhysisorption involves a weak van der Waals interaction between the adsorbate and \\nthe adsorbent surface. Therefore, the adsorption heat of physisorption is typically low. \\nUnlike chemisorption, physisorption is a totally reversible process and desorption \\ncan occur without dissociation of adsorbed molecules. Multiple layers (multilayers) \\nof adsorbates can also be formed during the physisorption process, if the pores in the \\nmaterial are large enough to permit this.  \\n \\nFigure 1. The illustration of gas adsorption.(Figure adapted from Ref.\\n1\\n) \\n2. 2.1 Gas adsorption isotherms  \\nGas adsorption isotherms can be obtained by measuring the amount of gas adsorbed \\nas function of a pressure at a given temperature (typically N2 isotherm at 77 K and up \\nto 1 bar).\\n2c, 3\\n A desorption isotherm is measured by reducing the pressure. The N2 \\nsorption isotherms are classified into six different types (Type I – VI) shown in \\nFigure 2.  \\nType I is a typical adsorption isotherm for microporous materials. The amount of gas \\nadsorbed increases rapidly at low relative pressures where micropores are filled by \\ngas molecules. The gas uptake reaches saturation at high relative pressures where \\npores are completely filled. Type II isotherm is observed for macroporous solids. The \\nExperimental and computational methods  \\n46 \\n \\npoint a in Figure 2II indicates a transition stage for adsorbates from monolayer to \\nmultilayer formation. Type III isotherm shows a very low gas uptake at low relative \\npressures indicating a weak adsorbate-adsorbent interaction. Type IV isotherm is \\nobserved for many mesoporous solids. The monolayer gas sorption is formed at low \\nrelative pressures (the point from a to b in Figure 2IV) which is similar to the Type II \\nisotherm. After the point b, the multilayer formation is followed. The high gas uptake \\noccurs after the point c due to gas condensation in the mesopores. Hysteresis is \\nobserved in Type IV isotherm. Type V isotherm has a low gas uptake at low relative \\npressures that is similar to type III isotherm and a hysteresis loop exists. Type VI \\nisotherm represents a stepwise adsorption process.  \\nFigure 2. The IUPAC classifications of adsorption isotherms. I – VI are type I – VI \\nisotherms, respectively. (Figure taken form Ref.\\n3\\n) \\nHysteresis can be observed in the adsorption isotherms for a number of gas-solid \\nsystems. The hysteresis loops are usually due to capillary condensation. Four types \\nof hysteresis loops are classified by IUPAC.\\n3 They are illustrated in Figure 3. Type \\nH1 has a steep adsorption and desorption curve at high relative pressures. Type H1 is \\na normally observed by porous solids with uniform pore size distribution. Type H2 is \\ngiven by porous solids with irregular sizes or shapes. Type H3 and H4 is seen by \\nporous solids with slit-shapes pore sizes. Type H4 is normally observed by \\na\\na\\nb\\nc\\nd\\nExperimental and computational methods  \\n47 \\n \\nmicoporous solids with Type I adsorption isotherm.  \\n \\nFigure 3. The IUPAC classifications of hysteresis loops. (Figure from Ref.\\n4c\\n) \\n2.2.2 Langmuir adsorption model  \\nOne widely-used model for describing gas adsorption processes was proposed first \\nby Langmuir. The assumptions of the Langmuir model are based on\\n2c, 4\\n: \\n1. Adsorption process occurs on the monolayer coverage. \\n2. All adsorbent surface sites are equivalent and each site can only \\naccommodate one adsorbate molecule.  \\n3. The interactions between adsorbate molecules on adjacent sites are not \\nconsidered.  \\nThe processes of adsorption and desorption are dynamic. The rate of adsorption \\ndepends on the pressure of adsorbate, P, and the fractional coverage of a surface,  , \\nis defined as: \\n   \\n                                   \\n                              \\n     (2. 1) \\nThe rate of adsorption is: \\n                                  (2. 2)  \\nExperimental and computational methods  \\n48 \\n \\n(   is the rate constant for adsorption step) \\nAnd  the rate of desorption is: \\n                            \\n  \\n  \\n                      (2. 3) \\n(   is the rate constant for desorption,    is activation energy of desorption) \\nAt equilibrium, the rate of adsorption and desorption are equal. Therefore, the \\nequation can be written as follows: \\n                  \\n  \\n  \\n     (2. 4) \\n \\n   \\n \\n    \\n        \\n  \\n  \\n     \\n   (2. 5) \\nwhere the overall rate constant K can be defined by: \\n    \\n   \\n        \\n  \\n  \\n   \\n   (2. 6) \\nIf n is the number of sites occupied and nm is the monolayer capacity, the fractional \\ncoverage of a surface,   can be written as: \\n   \\n \\n  \\n (2. 7) \\nLangmuir equation can be written as follow: \\n \\n  \\n \\n  \\n    \\n   (2. 8) \\nwhere P is the equilibrium pressure (mbar). n is the amount adsorbed (mmol/g). nm is \\nthe amount adsorbed in the monolayer (mmol/g). K is an adsorption coefficient. \\nExperimentally,   can be expressed as the volume of gas adsorbed (    ) divided by \\nthe volume of gas on the monolayer (     ): \\n  \\n    \\n     \\n   (2. 9) \\nThe Langmuir equation can be rewritten in the linear form as: \\n                            (2. 10) \\nExperimental and computational methods  \\n49 \\n \\nThe plot of P/ n against P will give a straight line with the slope of 1/nm.  \\nThe specific surface area can then be calculated via: \\n                         (2. 11) \\nwhere am is the molecular cross sectional area (nm\\n2\\n) and L is the Avogadro \\nconstant(6.023 × 10\\n23\\n mol\\n-1\\n).  \\n2.2.3 Brunauer-Emmett-Teller model (BET model)  \\nThe Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) model is most widely used to determine the \\nadsorption isotherms and surface areas of porous solids for the multilayer \\nadsorption.\\n2c, 5\\n The BET theory assumes that there is no interaction between \\nadsorption layers. The first monolayer of adsorbate has a fixed heat of adsorption, \\nwhereas the second and subsequent layers have heats of adsorption equal to the latent \\nheat of evaporation. The Langmuir model is applied to each adsorption layer. \\nTherefore, the BET equation can be expressed as: \\n \\n         \\n  \\n \\n   \\n \\n      \\n    \\n \\n \\n  \\n   (2. 12) \\nwhere, P is the equilibrium pressure. Po is the saturated gas pressure at 77 K. V is the \\ntotal gas adsorbed volume. Vm is the volume of gas adsorbed on monolayer. C is a \\nconstant. \\nA plot of \\n \\n         \\n against \\n \\n  \\n gives a linear graph.The gradient \\n      \\n    \\n and intercept \\n \\n   \\n \\ncan be obtained from the plot. The BET equation is widely used for N2 adsorption at \\n77 K and is applied to estimate the BET surface area. From both values of the slope \\nand the intercept, the value of Vm can be calculated and used to calculate the surface \\narea (SA), as follows: \\n                (2. 13) \\nwhere, L is the Avogadro number (6.023 × 10\\n23\\n mol\\n-1\\n) and Vo is the molar volume of \\nN2 (22,414 dm\\n3\\n/mol at the standard temperature and pressure) and σ is the area \\noccupied by each adsorbate molecule (16.2 Å\\n2\\n for a nitrogen molecule). The BET \\nequation has shown it to be linear only in the pressure range 0.05 < P/P0< 0.35 for \\nopen surfaces. \\nExperimental and computational methods  \\n50 \\n \\n2.3 Gas diffusion  \\nGas diffusion properties in porous materials play an important role in various \\napplications such as gas separation, catalytic process. The typical approach to \\ncharacterize diffusion is Fick’s laws.1 The first law by Fick describes a linear \\nrelationship between the matter flux,     and the concentration gradient     : \\n                 \\n  \\n  \\n    (2. 14) \\nwhere: D is the diffusion coefficient, the proportionality constant. C is the \\nconcentration and a  is diffusion distance.  \\nThe transport diffusion can be calculated from the matter flux and the concentration \\ngradient (from high concentration to low concentration). The illustration of transport \\ndiffusion is shown in Figure 4 (left). The transport diffusivity can be defined as the \\nequation below in terms of the corrected diffusivity, D0: \\n                 \\n    \\n    \\n      (2. 15) \\nHere, the partial derivative involves the adsorbate concentration , and the bulk \\nphase fugacity, f. \\nThe self-diffusion describes a movement of a molecule when the system is \\nequilibrated as shown in Figure 4 (right). In the three dimensional materials, the self-\\ndiffusivity can be determined by the mean square displacement (MSD) of molecular \\ntrajectories after t time by the Einstein relation: \\n             \\n \\n  \\n  \\n \\n     \\n \\n     \\n \\n    (2. 16) \\nwhere, \\n \\n     is the position of a molecular at time t, \\n \\n     \\n \\n     is the vector \\ndistance travelled by a diffusing molecule over time interval of the length t and the \\nangular brackets indicate an ensemble average.  \\nMolecular Dynamic (MD) simulations can be performed to study self-diffusivities of \\ngas molecules in porous solids based on the Einstein expression.\\n6\\n The self-\\ndiffusivities can be calculated from MSD plots. At extremely short times of the MSD \\nplot, the motion of the gas molecule is ballistic and the equation can be written as \\nExperimental and computational methods  \\n51 \\n \\n  \\n \\n     \\n \\n     \\n \\n      , therefore the slope of logarithmic plot of MSD is 2. There \\nis an intermediate region after the ballistic motion on the MSD plot and the slope of \\nlogarithmic plot is 0.5. The motion of gas molecule in this region is single file \\ndiffusion. Normal diffusion occurs when the slope of logarithmic plot is 1. For the \\nnormal diffusion, the MSDs should increase linearly with the time. The self-\\ndiffusivities for gas molecules in this thesis were determined from the data of normal \\ndiffusion region. More MD simulation details will be discussed in Chapter 6. \\n  \\n \\nFigure 4. Illustration of transport diffusion (left) and self-diffusion (right). (Figure \\ntaken from Ref.\\n1\\n) \\n2.4 X-ray diffraction techniques \\n2.4.1 X-ray diffraction  \\nX-ray diffraction is a very useful technique for characterizing structures (cell \\nparameters, space groups, full atomic positions), and phase purity of crystalline \\nmaterials.\\n7\\n Crystalline solids consist of parallel rows of atoms with a characteristic \\ninteratomic distance. Diffraction can occur when the wavelength of the X-ray has a \\nsimilar value of the interatomic distance of crystals. It can be expressed by Bragg’s \\nlaw.  \\n \\nHigh concentration Low concentration \\nEquilibrium \\nExperimental and computational methods  \\n52 \\n \\n \\nFigure 5. Bragg diffraction with two X-rays entering a crystal planes with a spacing, \\nd. (Figure taken from Ref.\\n7b\\n) \\nAs shown in Figure 5, two X-rays are shown here and the spacing between the \\natomic planes is labelled as d. The X-rays reflect off the atomic planes at the same \\nangle as the angle of incidence θ.  \\nThe difference in path length = AB + BC             (2. 17) \\nThis must be equal to an integral number, n, of wavelengths. And the wavelength of \\nX-rays is λ, then, \\n                (2. 18) \\nn - An integer determined by the order given \\nλ - Wavelength of x-rays \\nd - Spacing between the planes in the atomic lattice \\nThis is Bragg’s law for X-ray diffraction. When these X-rays are incident on the \\nsample they are diffracted by the atomic structure of the sample. The resulting \\ndiffraction patterns of X-rays at certain angles are then interpreted using Bragg’s law \\nto show structural information about the sample.  \\n2.4.2 Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD)  \\nA powder sample consists of many thousands of small crystallites in random \\norientations. Each small crystallites can give a diffraction pattern when a beam of X-\\nrays is scattered at specific angles upon the sample.\\n8\\n The diffracted beam produces a \\nExperimental and computational methods  \\n53 \\n \\ncone, and these cones will form circles on a flat plane which are Debye-Scherrer \\nrings shown in Figure 6.\\n8\\n The signal generated from Debye-Scherrer rings is \\nrecorded as peaks in the diffraction pattern. The diffraction pattern shows that the \\nintensity of diffracted beams is measured as a function of 2θ. X-ray powder \\ndiffraction can be used for phase identification of crystalline materials, such as \\ndetermination of unit cell dimensions, measurement of sample purity, and \\ndetermination of crystal structures using Rietveld refinement, particularly when it is \\nnot possible to grow diffractable crystals for single crystal XRD below.\\n9\\n  \\n \\nFigure 6. The diffraction from a powder sample. Cones and Debye-Scherrer rings \\nproduced by powder diffraction. (Figure taken from Ref.\\n8b\\n) \\n2.4.3 Single crystal X-ray diffraction \\nSingle crystal X-ray diffraction is the technique of choice for determining crystal \\nstructure, including unit cell dimensions and the positions of the atoms and chemical \\nbonds in the lattice.\\n7b\\n The crystals for this analysis must be single and sufficiently \\nlarge. The diffraction pattern generated from a single crystal is an array of spots in \\nreciprocal space. Each spot represents the direction of the hkl reflection in the unit \\ncell and is corresponded to a structure factor, Fhkl. The crystal structure is calculated \\nfrom the diffraction patterns by applying a three dimensional Fourier Transform. The \\natom positions will be calculated from the electron density distribution. The \\nstructures of cage molecules are determined by single crystal X-ray diffraction in \\nthis thesis. The data in this thesis is collected and refined by Dr John Bacsa, our \\ndepartmental crystallographer at the time of this work. \\nExperimental and computational methods  \\n54 \\n \\n2.5 Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA)  \\nTGA is used to characterize the thermal stability and solvent losses of the materials. \\nIt measures gravimetric weight loss from a sample as a function of increasing \\ntemperature. This is carried out under a flow of gas (in air or in an inert atmosphere \\nsuch as N2).\\n7b\\n \\n2.6 Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) \\nThe FTIR spectrum represents the absorption of different IR frequencies by chemical \\ncompounds. It is used to identify the type of chemical bonds because different \\nfunctional groups have characteristic vibrational frequencies. This thesis mainly uses \\nFTIR to characterize imine organic cage molecules, which have a strong imine \\nstretch at around 1640 cm\\n-1\\n in the IR spectra. \\n2.7 Scanning electron microscope (SEM) \\nIn SEM, high energy electrons are used to generate high magnification images of the \\nsurface of solids. SEM is also capable of performing analyses of morphology or \\ntopology, chemical composition, crystal orientations of porous solids.\\n7b\\n Here, I use it \\nto characterize sample morphology. \\n2.8 Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy \\nNMR is a powerful technique to determine molecular structure of organic \\ncompounds. It can provide definitive information about the molecules and their \\nenvironment based on the interactions of nuclear magnetic moments with \\nelectromagnetic radiation, in either liquid or the solid state. An NMR spectrum is \\ncomposed of a number of peaks. The positions and intensities of the peaks can \\ndetermine chemical environments of atoms. Due to good solubility of cage molecules, \\nsolution NMR is used in this thesis to characterize the molecular structures.  \\n2.9 High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) \\nHPLC is an analytical technique to separate a mixture of compounds. Moreover, \\neach component can be identified and quantified when HPLC combines with mass \\nspectrometry. HPLC utilizes the different interaction between the compounds, a \\ncolumn which contains a solid stationary phase and liquid mobile phase to separate a \\nExperimental and computational methods  \\n55 \\n \\nmixture of compounds. By choosing the proper column or mobile phase, the \\ncompounds can separated based on hydrophobicity or size. Reversed phase \\nchromatography which includes a non-polar stationary phase and polar mobile phase \\n(solvents) are used to separate cage molecules in this thesis. The separation is based \\non molecular hydrophobicity properties. HPLC can also be used preparatively to \\nseparate samples on a larger scale (see e.g., Chapter 5, section 5.8). \\n2.10 Mass spectrometry (MS) \\nMass spectrometry (MS) is a useful technique to measure the mass of a compound \\nand to determine the elemental composition. The compound is ionized for the \\nanalysis. A range of different ionization methods have been used including electron \\nionization (EI), chemical ionization (CI), electrospray ionization (ESI) and matrix-\\nassisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI). Here, we use MS to validate the \\nidentity of newly synthesized cages, and to ensure that catenanes are not formed.\\n10\\n \\n2.11 Equipment details \\nNMR. Solution \\n1\\nH NMR spectra were recorded at 400.13 MHz using a Bruker \\nAvance 400 NMR spectrometer. \\n13\\nC NMR spectra were recorded at 100.6 MHz. \\nThermogravimetric Analysis. TGA analysis was carried out using a Q5000IR \\nanalyzer (TA instruments) with an automated vertical overhead thermobalance. In a \\nmeasurement, a sample was placed in a platinum pan and heated to 500-600 °C for \\ncage materials with a heating rate of 5 °C / min under N2 gas, and then cooled down \\nto 25 °C with a rate of 50 °C / min.  \\nPowder X-ray Diffraction. PXRD data were collected on a Panalytical X’pert pro \\nmulti-purpose diffractometer (MPD) in transmission Debye-Scherrer geometry \\noperating with a Cu anode at 40 kV 40 mA. Samples were ground and mounted as \\nloose powder onto a transparent film and spun at 2s/rotation. PXRD patterns were \\ncollected in 161 hour scans with a step size of 0.013 degrees 2θ and scan time of 115 \\ns/step over 5 – 50 deg 2θ. The incident X-ray beam was conditioned with 0.04 rad \\nSoller slits and an anti-scatter slit of 1/2 deg. The diffracted beam passed through an \\nautomatic antiscatter slit (5 mm), 0.04 rad Soller slits and Ni filter before processing \\nby the PIXcel detector operating in scanning mode.  \\nExperimental and computational methods  \\n56 \\n \\nThe data for CC6 in Chapter 4 were also measured on a Bruker D8 advance \\ndiffractometer using monochromatic Cu Kα1 radiation (λ = 1.54056 Å). Samples \\nwere mounted in 1.0 mm diameter special glass capillaries and recorded over 3 - 40 \\ndeg 2θ. \\nGas Sorption Analysis. All samples were tested with gases of the following purities: \\nhydrogen (99.9995% - BOC gases), carbon dioxide (SCF grade – BOC gases) and \\nmethane (ultrahigh purity -BOC). Surface areas and pore size distributions were \\nmeasured by nitrogen adsorption and desorption at 77.3 K using either a \\nMicromeritics ASAP 2420 or ASAP 2020 volumetric adsorption analyzer. Samples \\nwere degassed offline at 120 °C for 15 h under vacuum (10\\n-5\\n bar) before analysis. \\nPore size distributions and pore volumes were derived from the adsorption branches \\nof the isotherms using non-local density functional theory model (NL-DFT) within \\nthe Micrometritics ASAP software.  \\nHydrogen isotherms were measured using a Micrometrics ASAP 2420 volumetric \\nadsorption analyzer at 77.3 K. High pressure hydrogen adsorption and desorption \\nisotherms up to 10 bar were measured using Micrometritics ASAP 2050 sorption \\nanalyzer.  \\nCarbon dioxide isotherms were measured at 273 and 293 K using a Micromeritics \\n2020 volumetric adsorption analyzer. \\nMethane isotherms were measured using either a Micromeritics ASAP 2420 at 298 K \\nusing a water bath, 273 K using an ice water mix and at 196 K using an acetone dry \\nice mixture, or a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 at 263, 273, 283 and 293 K using a \\nchiller/circulator. \\nFourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy.

First they attempt to solve \\nthe Schrödinger equation. The Schrödinger equation describes the movement of a \\nparticle of mass, m, in three dimensions with energy, E. The time independent \\nSchrödinger equation is written as: \\n  \\n \\n \\n  \\n            (2. 19) \\nwhere, m is the mass of the particle, ħ is Planck’s constant,    is relative to cartesian \\ncoordinates, x, y and z (     \\n  \\n   \\n \\n  \\n   \\n \\n  \\n   \\n ),   is the potential energy, and   is the \\nwavefunction. It can be rewritten as: \\n        (2. 20) \\nwhere,   is the Hamiltonian operator of the system. \\n2.12.1.1 Wavefunction methods \\nA number of approximations and methods have been used to solve the Schrödinger \\nequation.\\n11\\n In the Born-Oppenheimer (BO) approximation, electronic and nuclear \\nmotions are considered separately. The nuclei are assumed to be stationary and \\nelectrons are assumed to be in the ground state. The electronic time independent \\nSchrödinger equation can be expressed for N electrons in the external field generated \\nby nuclei. A further approximation related to wavefunction methods is the Linear \\nCombination of Atomic Orbitals (LCAO). The method assumes the wavefunction as \\na series of functions of atomic orbitals.  \\nThe Hartree-Fock (HF) method is the basis of molecular orbital theory, which can be \\nused to solve the Schrödinger equation for a many-body system.\\n11\\n This method treats \\nmany electron wavefunctions as a series of electron wavefunctions without \\nconsidering electron correlation effects. A simple approximation for the many-body \\nwavefunctions is given by a single Slater determination of N electrons. A self-\\nconsistent field (SCF) procedure is used to solve the equations.\\n11\\n The HF method is \\nExperimental and computational methods  \\n59 \\n \\nwidely used for energy calculations of small molecules. The disadvantages of the \\nmethod are that electron correlation is not accounted and it is computationally \\nexpensive. Furthermore, post Hartree-Fock methods are used to improve the energy \\ncorrelation effects in the calculations. \\n2.12.1.2 Density functional theory (DFT) \\nDensity Functional Theory (DFT) is mainly concerned with the relationship between \\ntotal electronic energy and overall electronic density rather than the wavefunction.\\n11-\\n12\\n DFT calculations have been carried out in this thesis and more details will be \\ndescribed in the following sections.  \\nThe Hohenberg-Kohn theorems are considered as functional theorems of DFT.\\n13\\n For \\na system with a non-degenerate ground state, the first theorem means that the ground \\nstate electron density, \\uf072 (r) of a many electron system can uniquely determine the \\nexternal potential Vext, with which it is sufficient to construct the full Hamiltonian \\noperator and hence calculate any ground state property of the system. The total \\nenergy can be written as: \\n                       (2. 21) \\n                   (2. 22) \\nwhere,          is the external energy. The Hohenberg-Kohn functional      is the \\nsum of the kinetic energy      and the electron-electron repulsion operator      . \\nThe second theorem proves that the ground state density is not only unique, but also \\nthe only one which minimizes the total energy.  \\nThe Kohn-Sham Approach \\nThe electron-electron repulsion operator        consists of the classical electron-\\nelectron interaction energy      and non-classical contribution to electron-electron \\ninteraction energy         . Therefore, the total energy can be rewritten as follows: \\n                                               (2. 23) \\nIn 1965, Kohn and Sham gave a solution to the unknown functional of the kinetic \\nenergy, where they formally split this functional into two parts\\n14\\n:  \\nExperimental and computational methods  \\n60 \\n \\n                    (2. 24) \\nHere the first part,       , is the kinetic energy of a model system of N non-\\ninteracting electrons. This can be expressed in a one particle approach similar to the \\nHartree-Fock method. While        is the residual part of the kinetic energy which is \\nnot covered by      .       is still an unknown term. The exchange-correlation \\nfunctional        is used to contain everything that is unknown. The equation is \\nshown as follows: \\n                         (2. 25) \\nTherefore, the expression for the energy can be rewritten:  \\n                                    (2. 26) \\nThe main point of the Kohn-Sham Approach is that for any interacting system, one \\ncan find a non-interacting model system, with some local effective potential        , \\nwith a ground state density which exactly equals the ground-state density of the \\ninteracting system. The difference in the kinetic energy between the interacting \\nelectron system and the model non-interacting system, as well as the many-particle \\neffects, the exchange and correlation energy contribution are taken into account in \\nthe term       . \\nSelf-consistent calculations \\nThe minimization process corresponds to the determination of the solution of Kohn-\\nSham Equation: \\n  \\n \\n \\n  \\n                                          (2. 27) \\nHere,         is the wavefunction of electronic state,    is the Kohn-Sham energy, and \\n       is the Hartree potential of the electrons given by: \\n        \\n   \\n    \\n      \\n        (2. 28) \\nThe exchange-correlation potential        is given by the functional derivative: \\n        \\n          \\n     \\n   (2. 29) \\nExperimental and computational methods  \\n61 \\n \\nWhich will lead to the Kohn-Sham energy,    . Since the potentials in this equation \\ndepend on the electron density, which in turn depends on the one-particle \\nwavefunction       , the Kohn-Sham equations must be solved self-consistently. The \\nrough structure of an electronic self-consistent cycle is followed in Figure 7.  \\n \\nFigure 7. Illustration of the self-consistent field method to solve Kohn-Sham \\nEquation. \\n2.12.1.3 Exchange correlation functionals \\nThe Local Density Approximation (LDA) \\nThe problem is that the exchange correlation term is not known. Some assumptions \\nmust be applied to solve the integrations. Within the local density approximation \\n(LDA), the exchange correlation energy is the sum of the exchange correlation \\nenergy per electron. The density at each point is the same which is treated as \\nhomogeneous electron gas.\\n15\\n The LDA approximation works quite well for \\nhomogeneous and over binding systems such as metal systems. However, it can lead \\nto a poor description of inhomogeneous and weakly bonded systems. This is mainly \\nFrom an existing electron density ρ0 construct the various components from the potential :\\nSolve the Kohn-Sham equation:\\n  \\nħ2\\n2 \\n 2 +   𝑥    +  𝐻   +  𝑋           =      ( ) \\nCalculate the total energy from the \\nvarious contributions\\nCheck energy if E KS,step - E KS,step -1 < δ E\\nif not, go back to the first step\\nPrint the energy\\nYes\\nNo\\n    ( )  =   𝑥    +  𝐻   +  𝑋     \\nExperimental and computational methods  \\n62 \\n \\ndue to the fact that the electron distribution within the molecule is far from being \\nuniform. The approximation leads to underestimation of lattice parameters and band \\ngaps, while overestimation of cohesive energies and phonon frequencies.\\n16\\n  \\nGeneralized Gradient Approximation (GGA)  \\nGGA can be used to construct functionals which depend not only on the density but \\nalso on its gradient \\uf0d1 ρ.17 GGA functionals typically improve the description of weak \\nbonding (for example, hydrogen bonds) and is also suitable for magnetic systems. It \\ngives a better description of bond angles, lengths and energies compared to LDA. \\nThe Becke exchange functional\\n18\\n combined with the Lee-Yang-Parr correlation \\nfunctional\\n19\\n (BLYP) has been widely used. The PBE functional developed by Perdew, \\nBurke and Ernzerhof in 1996 is a further improvement of the local spin density (LSD) \\napproximation, giving a simple derivation and a good energy calculation accuracy.\\n20\\n   \\nHybrid functionals \\nOne development in DFT was hybrid functionals where the exchange correlation \\nenergy functional incorporates a fraction of Hartree-Fock (HF) exchange.\\n12\\n A hybrid \\nexchange correlation functional is expressed as a linear combination of the HF \\nexchange functional   \\n  . The exchange and correlation contributions are calculated \\nusing DFT,    \\n    and     \\n   . It is expressed as: \\n   \\n      \\n     \\n     \\n           \\n       (2. 30) \\nwhere:   is chosen to satisfy certain criteria. B3LYP (Becke, three-parameter, Lee-\\nYang-Parr) function is one of hybrid methods.\\n21\\n The hybrid functional gives a high \\nlevel of accuracy, but a less computational expense.  \\n2.12.1.4 Dispersion correction for DFT calculations  \\nDFT is a commonly used method for electronic structure calculations, which can \\nprovide reasonably accurate results for many properties of various molecules. \\nHowever, a general disadvantage of all GGA, LDA and hybrid functionals is that \\nthey do not have a description of the long range electron correlation that is \\nresponsible for van der Waals interactions. Recently, a method of dispersion \\ncorrection for standard DFT (DFT-D) has been proposed to calculate intermolecular \\ninteraction energies with higher accuracy.\\n22\\n When using the dispersion correction, the \\nExperimental and computational methods  \\n63 \\n \\ntotal energy is the sum of the self-consistent Kohn-Sham energy (       ) and the \\nempirical dispersion correction energy (      ).       is an empirical dispersion \\ncorrection which is given by \\n22\\n: \\n               \\n  \\n  \\n   \\n \\n \\n     \\n   \\n               (2. 31) \\nHere, N  is the number of atoms in the system,   \\n  \\n is the dispersion coefficient for the \\natom pair ij, S6 is a global scaling factor and Rij is the interatomic distance. The \\ninteratomic   \\n  \\n term is calculated as a geometric mean of the form: \\n  \\n  \\n    \\n   \\n \\n   (2. 32) \\nCP2K is a DFT code used in the thesis which includes a dispersion correction.\\n23\\n   \\n2.12.1.5 Basis sets  \\nBasis sets are sets of functions which are used to describe molecular orbitals. \\nIncreasing the size of the basis sets will typically improve the accuracy of the \\ncalculation. A minimal basis set describes each core or valence orbital by one \\nfunction such as Slater Type Orbital (STO-nG), where n is an integer. One popular \\ntype of basis set is based on Gaussian functions. Here, the molecular orbital (MO) is \\ndescribed by a linear combination of atomic orbitals (AO). Gaussian type orbitals \\n(GTOs) are generated from the equation: \\n          𝑥         \\n \\n   (2. 33) \\nwhere,   determines the spread of the function,   is the distance from the nucleus, \\nx ,y ,z are Cartesian variables and l, m, n are the order of the function. If the sum of l, \\nm, n is equal to zero or one, the functions are equivalent to s orbitals or px, py and pz \\norbitals. \\nThe double-zeta (DZ), triple-zeta (TZ), quadruple-zeta (QZ) basis sets are used to \\ndescribe each valence atomic orbital using multiple basis functions. In addition, the \\nsplit valence DZ basis sets use two functions for describing the valence orbitals, for \\nexample, 3-21G and 6 -31G. Here, 3-21G means that 3 primitive Gaussian functions \\nto describe each inner shell obitial and each valence orbital with two basis functions, \\nExperimental and computational methods  \\n64 \\n \\nwhich combines 2 primitive and 1 primitive Gaussian functions for each valence \\norbital. Furthermore, polarization functions and diffuse functions are added as extra \\nimprovements, for example, 3-21G\\n*\\n(d polarization functions on heavy atoms, 3-\\n21G\\n** \\nis 3-21G\\n*\\n and p polarization functions for hydrogen), 3-21+G (diffuse \\nfunctions) and 3-21+G\\n*\\n(polarization and diffuse functions). Dunning developed \\ncorrelation consistent polarized basis sets such as cc-pVDZ(double zeta) and cc-\\npVTZ(triple zeta).\\n24\\n The main advantage of Dunning basis sets is to reduce the \\nnumber of primitive functions and take into account core-valence correlation effects. \\nThe Dunning basis sets can also add diffusion functions for better describing weakly \\ninteracting molecules. For a periodic system, the plane wave (PW) basis sets are \\nwidely used. PW basis sets combined with pseudopotential (effective core potential) \\ncan result in small wavefuctions and density gradients for core electrons which allow \\nan efficient calculation of bulk materials. The CP2K, quickstep program used in the \\nthesis uses a Gaussian and plane waves method (GPW) and its  augmented extension \\n(GAPW).\\n23\\n The GPW method uses a dual basis of atom centred Gaussian orbitals \\nand plane waves. Therefore, the density is represented by an expansion of atom \\ncentred Gaussian functions and plane waves. The Goedecker, Teter and Hutter (GTH) \\npseudopotential is used to describe the effective core potential.\\n25\\n  \\n2.12.2 Force fields  \\nIn contrast to quantum mechanics, force fields ignore electrons and use a set of \\nparameters and functional forms to describe the potential energy surface (PES) of a \\nsystem. These parameters and functional forms are fitted to experimental data or \\nhigh-level quantum mechanical calculations. The advantage of force fields is that \\nthey are computationally less expensive than methods such as DFT, though the \\naccuracy can suffer if they are not parameterized correctly.  \\nForce fields for molecular systems can be expressed in terms of intermolecular and \\nintramolecular forces. The total energy in the force field can be written as        \\n                     where the bonded and non-bonded contributions are given \\nby the following equations\\n12\\n: \\n                                (2. 34) \\n                                    (2. 35) \\nExperimental and computational methods  \\n65 \\n \\nwhere       is the intramolecular energy of the system, which consists of bond \\nstretching (      ), bending (      ) and torsions (     ).              is the \\nintermolecular energy which consists of electrostatic interactions (     ) and van der \\nWaals interactions (    ) \\nThe form of the intramolecular potentials used here are as follows\\n12\\n: \\n       \\n \\n \\n         \\n     (2. 36) \\nIn the bond stretching energy term (     ), the energy can be described as the square \\nof the displacement from the reference bond length lo. k is the bond stretching force \\nconstant. \\n       \\n \\n \\n          \\n     (2. 37) \\nThe angle bending (     ) is expressed using Hooke’s law.\\n12\\n k’ is the angle bending \\nforce constant. θo is the equilibrium value for bond angle. And θ is the actual angle.  \\nBond stretching and angle bending are considered as hard degrees of freedom. More \\nvariations in the structure come from torsions and non bonding terms. The torsional \\nterm used here is\\n12\\n: \\n       \\n  \\n \\n \\n                (2. 38) \\nThe expression for the torsional term is a cosine series expansion.   is the torsion \\nangle,    is the barrier height,   is the multiplicity, which gives the number of \\nminimum points in the function as the bond is rotated through 360 °.   is the phase \\nfactor which determines where the torsion angle passes through its minimum value.  \\nThe van der Waals potential functions usually use Lennard-Jones functions. Its 9-6 \\nform is expressed as: \\n          \\n \\n   \\n    \\n \\n   \\n         (2. 39) \\n  is the well depth,      is the separation between point charges, and   is the collision \\ndiameter. \\nThe Coulombic interaction is a long range force to deal with charged ions, with an \\nExperimental and computational methods  \\n66 \\n \\n   \\n-1 \\ninverse dependence on distance, as given by Coulomb\\'s Law: \\n        \\n      \\n        \\n                   (2. 40) \\nwhere qi and qj are two point charge,     is the separation between point charges.     is \\nthe electronic constant of vacuum.  \\nThere are several examples of generic force fields for molecular simulations, such as \\nUniversal force field (UFF),\\n26\\n COMPASS,\\n27\\n and PCFF.\\n28\\n  In this thesis, due to the \\nunique properties of cage molecules, generic force fields can not accurately describe \\nthe structure. A cage specific force field (CSFF) was developed in the Cooper \\nresearch group by Daniel Holden.\\n29\\n CSFF was parameterized based on PCFF\\n28\\n and \\nrefitted for cage molecules. The force field (FF) parameters for the intra-molecular \\nbonds, angles and dihedral potentials for the cage fragment were fitted using Density \\nFunctional Theory (DFT) with a B3LYP functional and 6-31G** basis set.\\n30\\n The \\nenergy curves from DFT have a good agreement with the optimized FF energy \\ncurves. Lennard-Jones (LJ) 9-6 potentials were refitted to describe the non-bonding \\ninteractions between cages. It has been shown that the CSFF minimized structures \\nfor crystalline cage 1, cage 2 and cage 3 compare well to the structures obtained from \\nsingle crystal XRD.\\n29\\n \\n2.12.3 Energy minimization  \\nEnergy minimization methods are used to find the global energy minimum which is a \\nstable state of the system. Minimization algorithms can be divided into non-\\nderivative minimization and derivative methods. Most minimization algorithms are \\nused to find the local minimum which is the nearest minimum to the initial \\nconfiguration. At the minimum point the first derivative of the function f with respect \\nto each variable 𝑥  is zero and the second derivatives are positive. \\n  \\n   \\n        \\n   \\n   \\n  > 0   (2. 41) \\nThe energy minimization calculations were performed using Forcite or Discover \\nmodules in Material studio 5.0 (Accelrys) with CSFF in this thesis. The steepest \\ndescent, conjugate gradient and quasi-Newton methods are included.\\n12\\n  \\nSteepest descent method is a first-order minimization method. The method uses a \\nExperimental and computational methods  \\n67 \\n \\nzig-zag like path to find the local minimum. The choice of direction is where a \\nfunction f decreases most quickly and the gradient direction from the starting point is \\nalong the line search. The disadvantage of the method is a slow convergence and that \\nthe linear search may result in an estimate with a large error. The steepest descent \\nmethod is often used for the initial configuration far from the minimum as a first and \\nrough optimization process.  \\nConjugate gradient method is also a first-order derivative technique. For each \\nminimization step, the gradient of the function for changing the direction vector is \\ncalculated. Combining this gradient and the information obtained from the previous \\ninteraction can produce a new direction vector of the minimization procedure. The \\nmethod is a good choice for large scale systems as it has a less computational \\nexpense and higher level of accuracy than the steepest descent method. \\nUnlike computing the true Hessian matrix as in second order Newton methods, \\nquasi-Newton methods use approximations to minimize the energy of a system, \\nwhich is based on the change in gradient between interactions. DFP \\n31\\n and BFGS \\n32\\n \\n(proposed by Broyden, Fletcher, Goldfarb and Shanno) algorithms are widely used. \\nThe quasi-Newton requires less memory and computational expense.  \\n2.12.4 Molecular dynamics (MD)  \\n2.12.4.1 General introduction \\nThe objective of molecular dynamics (MD) is a computational method to simulate \\nthe time dependent behaviour of a molecular system. MD simulations can provide \\ninformation on the kinetic and diffusive properties of the systems. The fluctuations \\nand conformational change of molecular structure can then be observed. Successive \\nconfigurations of the system are generated according to Newton’s laws, which are \\nused to describe the atomic trajectories and velocities. It can be expressed as: \\n          (2. 42) \\nwhere Fi is the force of a particle i, ai is the acceleration and mi is the mass of a \\nparticle.  \\nTo calculate the trajectory of the particles this law is solved as \\nExperimental and computational methods  \\n68 \\n \\n    \\n   \\n \\n   \\n  \\n      (2. 43) \\nwhere 𝑥  is the position of the particle i, with mass mi and F is the force of a particle. \\nMD is a deterministic technique, when an initial set of positions and velocities are \\ngiven, the subsequent positions and velocities will be determined.   \\n2.12.4.2 Molecular dynamic algorithms  \\nThere are different algorithms for integrating the Newton’s equations. Most \\nintegration algorithms are based on finite difference methods. First the total force of \\natoms is calculated and assumed to be constant, and then the accelerations can be \\ndetermined. The positions and velocities at a time      can be calculated from the \\naccelerations, positions and velocities at a time t. The position, velocity and \\nacceleration can be approximated as expansions of the Taylor series \\n12\\n: \\n                        \\n \\n \\n        \\n \\n \\n              (2. 44) \\n                      \\n \\n \\n         \\n \\n \\n              (2. 45) \\n                       \\n \\n \\n               (2. 46) \\nwhere   is the velocity (the first derivative of the positions with respect to time),   is \\nthe acceleration (the second derivative),   is the third derivative.  \\nThe Verlet algorithm\\n33\\n uses the positions and accelerations at a time t and the \\npositions and accelerations from the previous step r (t - δt) to calculate the new \\npositions r (t + δt). \\n The equations can be written down as follows: \\n                      \\n \\n \\n              (2. 47) \\n                      \\n \\n \\n               (2. 48) \\nCombining the two expressions gives: \\n                                    (2. 49) \\nThe velocities can simply be calculated by the difference in the positions at time \\nExperimental and computational methods  \\n69 \\n \\n     and     : \\n                                (2. 50) \\nThe disadvantage of the Verlet algorithm is that it is a not self-starting algorithm. \\nWhen t = 0, the previous positions r (t - δt) can not be obtained. The velocities are \\nnot explicitly calculated.  \\nThere are several improvements upon the Verlet algorithm. They are the Leapfrog \\nVerlet algorithm\\n34\\n and the Velocity Verlet algorithm.\\n35\\n The Leapfrog Verlet algorithm \\ncalculates the velocities at     \\n \\n \\n     from the velocities at     \\n \\n \\n    and the \\naccelerations at t. The positions at         can be obtained from velocities at \\n    \\n \\n \\n    and the positions at     .  \\n                     \\n \\n \\n        (2. 51) \\n    \\n \\n \\n        \\n \\n \\n             (2. 52) \\nThe velocities at time t can then be calculated from  \\n      \\n \\n \\n      \\n \\n \\n        \\n \\n \\n       (2. 53) \\nThe velocities leap over the positions at t to calculate the values at t+ \\n \\n \\nδt. The \\nadvantage of the Leapfrog Verlet algorithm is the precision of the velocities. The \\nVelocity Verlet method gives positions, velocities and accelerations at the same time \\nand it is more computationally expensive. \\n2.12.4.3 Molecular dynamic ensembles \\nMD simulations can be performed using an ensemble with a constant number of \\nparticles (N), volume (V) and total energy (E). The microcanonical ensemble (NVE) \\nis obtained by solving Newton’s equation with temperature and pressure exchanged.  \\nDifferent ensembles can be applied depending on the system and properties of \\nsimulations. Alternative ensembles include the constant number of particles, volume \\nand temperature (NVT) and the constant number of particles, pressure and \\ntemperature (NPT) ensembles. The constant temperature is obtained by coupling to a \\nheat bath that keeps the system at the average temperature. The thermostat methods \\nExperimental and computational methods  \\n70 \\n \\ninclude Nosé-Hoover and Berendsen thermostat.\\n32a, 36\\n In the case of NPT, the number \\nof particles, pressure and temperature are conserved where the volume and energy \\nare allowed to fluctuate in order to equilibrate the system. Thermostat and barostat \\nmethods need to be used to keep constant temperature and pressure, respectively.  \\n2.12.5 Monte carlo simulations (MC) \\nThe Monte Carlo ((MC) method is used to generate a sequence of configurations of a \\nsystem by randomly changing the positions and orientations of the molecule. The \\nmethod accepts a new configuration (Enew) with a lower energy than the previous one \\n(Eold). However, if Enew > Eold, the Boltzmann factor is used to compare with a \\nrandom number (0-1). If the Boltzmann factor is bigger than the random number, the \\nconfiguration is accepted. A basis MC algorithm consists of randomly selecting a \\nparticle and trial moves. It is a non-deterministic technique.   \\nThe Grand Canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) is to simulate the system at constant \\nchemical potential, μ, temperature, T, and volume, V, while the number of particles \\nmay change during the simulation. The simulation is performed in the following \\nsteps:  \\n(1) Displacement of particles using the Metropolis method.12   \\n(2) Creation and removal of particles.  \\nGCMC simulations have been widely used for simulating adsorption isotherms or \\nloading of molecules. In this thesis, the amorphous cage models are initially built \\nusing the Amorphous Cell module in the Materials Studio Modeling 5.0 software \\npackage (Accelrys), which is based on the GCMC method.  \\n2.12.6 Calculated surface areas \\nSurface area is a very important property for the characterization of porous solids. \\nExperimental surface areas are determined from nitrogen isotherms measured at 77 K \\nby the BET model as discussed in section 2.2.4 above. The surface areas can also be \\ncalculated using a geometric method from the structural model. The calculated \\nsurface areas in this thesis are obtained by rolling a probe around the surface of the \\npores. The Connolly surface area (CSA) is defined as a probe molecule rolling across \\nthe interface between the probe and the pore surface.

Mater. 2009.\\n1\\n Previously, the imine-linked organic cage molecule, \\nCC1, was synthesised by a one-step [4+6] cycloimination condensation reaction \\nbetween 1,3,5-triformylbenzene and 1,2-ethylenediamine.\\n1\\n The CC1 molecule has \\ntetrahedral symmetry and the structure is connected by six unfunctionalized ethylene \\nvertices. The crystals exhibit monoclinic P21/c symmetry after desolvation from \\nethyl acetate (EtOAc). The packing structure for CC1 illustrates isolated lattice voids \\nas represented by the orange Connolly surface in Figure 1. CC1 is therefore formally \\nnon-porous due to a lack of interconnected cage voids. Gas sorption analysis has \\nshowed that CC1 adsorbs very little N2 or H2 at 77.3 K with a BET surface area of \\n23 m\\n2\\n/g calculated from the N2 isotherm. This is consistent with the disconnected \\nvoid structure. However, CC1 is able to adsorb CH4 and CO2 at room temperature \\nexhibiting porosity „without pores‟ as observed for calix[4]arene. 2 \\n \\nFigure 1.  The crystal structure for CC1 (hydrogen atoms are omitted for clarity. \\nCarbon and nitrogen atoms are colored gray and blue, respectively). The molecular \\npacking results in isolated void volume as illustrated by the orange Connolly surface. \\nCC1 was firstly synthesized by Dr Tomokazu Tozawa in the Cooper research group. \\nThe fascinating cage structure and molecular packing suggested that different \\ntrialdehyde and diamine monomers could be used to synthesize more porous organic \\ncage systems. Commercially available trialdehydes with functional groups are \\nlimited, but there are a number of commercially available functionalized diamines. \\nInitially, 1,2-propylenediamine and diaminomaleonitrile monomers were chosen to \\nreact with 1,3,5-triformylbenzene to form [4+6] imine cage molecules. The intention \\nCrystalline Porous Organic Cage – CC2 \\n77 \\n \\nwas to investigate the effects of the functional groups (the methyl and cyano group) \\nof the cage vertices on the crystal packing and porosity. Furthermore, post-synthetic \\nmodification could be carried out using the functionalities on the cage vertices. \\n3.2 Preliminary reactions to form cage molecules \\nThe reaction procedure followed the CC1 synthesis method. The reaction ratio of \\ntrialdehyde and diamine monomers of 2: 3 was used. The solvent (35 mL) was added \\nto 1,3,5-triformylbenzene (50 mg, 0.31 mmol) in a sample vial. A solution of the \\ncorresponding amount of diamine (5 mL of solvent) was added. The resulting \\nmixture was kept for 3-5 days without stirring at room temperature. In this study, \\nchloroform (CHCl3), dichloromethane (DCM), ethyl acetate (EtOAc), and \\nacetonitrile (CH3CN) solvents were included for testing reactions. It was found that \\nsolvents played an important role in the CC1 synthesis.\\n1\\n \\n \\nScheme 1. Synthesis of imine cage molecules, analogous to CC1. The reactions were \\ncarried out using 1,3,5-triformylbenzene and 1, 2-propylenediamine or \\ndiaminomaleonitrile in a series of solvents. \\nThe reactions of 1,3,5-triformylbenzene and diaminomaleonitrile in different \\nsolvents formed insoluble yellow solids which precipitated from the reaction solution. \\n1\\nH NMR was used to analyze the filtrate, showing unreacted trialdehyde. The \\npreliminary reactions of 1,3,5-triformylbenzene and diaminomaleonitrile monomers \\ndid not proceed successfully to form cage molecules. This might be ascribed to \\nelectron withdrawing CN functional groups which reduce the reactivity of diamine. \\nIn the case of 1,2-propylenediamine monomer, insoluble polymer was observed from \\nthe reaction in EtOAc. The products obtained from the reactions in CHCl3 or DCM \\nshowed some evidence of cage formation based on NMR analysis, but some \\nCrystalline Porous Organic Cage – CC2 \\n78 \\n \\nimpurities were also present, which could not be identified by NMR. Fortunately, \\nsingle crystals were observed to grow after 3 days directly from the reaction in \\nCH3CN solvent. Single crystal X-ray analysis confirmed that the [4+6] cage \\nmolecule had formed.  \\nIn this Chapter, I will focus on introducing CC2 which is synthesized by the reaction \\nof 1,3,5-triformylbenzene with 1,2-propylenediamine in CH3CN solvent. Products \\nwere isolated directly as crystals which were characterized by single crystal X-ray \\ndiffraction. The CC2 molecule has a tetrahedral symmetry with one methyl group on \\neach vertex. The methyl group directs molecular packing to give one-dimensional \\n(1D) pore channels which run between the cages. Unlike CC1, the CC2 material \\nexhibits permanent porosity and adsorbs a significant amount of gas molecules, such \\nas N2, H2, CH4 and CO2.  \\n3.3 Synthesis of cage 2 (CC2) \\nCC2 was synthesized by a condensation reaction of 1,3,5-triformylbenzene with 1,2-\\npropylenediamine in a [4+6] cycloimination reaction in the absence of any added \\ncatalyst or template shown in Scheme 2. Acetonitrile (35 mL) was added to 1, 3, 5-\\ntriformylbenzene (50 mg, 0.31 mmol) in a sample vial at room temperature. After 5 \\nminutes, a solution of 1, 2-diaminopropane (34 mg, 0.47 mmol) in CH3CN (5 mL) \\nwas added. The resulting mixture was left covered for 3 days without stirring. A \\nturbid solution was observed to form within 5 minutes after 1,2-diaminopropane was \\nadded to the partially dissolved trialdehyde. This was followed by precipitation of a \\nsolid after around 5–6 hours and finally, pale white needles of CC2 were observed to \\ncrystallize from solution after 3 days. The crystals were separated carefully from the \\nsample using a spatula, washed with acetonitrile and air dried to give the acetonitrile \\nsolvate of CC2. To desolvate CC2, a sample was heated to 120 ºC under dynamic \\nvacuum for 12 hours. The final isolated CC2 yield was 37 %. Mass spectrometry \\nshowed [M + H]\\n +\\n and [M+ Na]\\n +\\n ions at m/z = 877 and 899, consistent with a [4+6] \\ncage structure with formula C54H60N12. \\nCrystalline Porous Organic Cage – CC2 \\n79 \\n \\n \\nScheme 2. Covalent synthesis of a [4+6] tetrahedral organic cage molecule, CC2. \\nCC2 exists as four isomers due to positional disorder of methyl groups on the \\nvertices. The positional isomers were addressed by Dr Alexander Steiner and are \\nshown in Figure 2. The four different isomers were named as 3111, 2220, 2211, and \\n3210, by noting the number of adjacent methyl groups to the phenyl rings within the \\ncage. For example, „3‟ means three of the adjacent carbon atoms of C6H3(CN)3 unit \\ncarry a methyl group. The CC2 is chiral containing R or S enantimoers, even though \\na racemic mixture of the diamine was used. That is, each cage molecule is resolved \\ninto R or S configuration resulting from reaction of either 6 x S diamines or 6 x R \\ndiamines with 4 equivalents of triformylbenzene.   \\nCC2\\n4             :            6\\nCrystalline Porous Organic Cage – CC2 \\n80 \\n \\n \\nFigure 2. Positional isomers of CC2. (Figure taken from the Ref. \\n1\\n) \\n3.4 Characterizations of CC2  \\n3.4.1 NMR spectra of CC2 \\nCC2 is fully soluble in chloroform and was characterized by \\n1\\nH and \\n13\\nC NMR \\nspectroscopy. \\n1\\nH NMR chemical shifts of the imine protons were observed at 8.2 \\nppm where the integration of peaks is 12H (Figure 3). There are multiple peaks due \\nto methyl groups on the cage vertices which give the different positional isomers of \\nCrystalline Porous Organic Cage – CC2 \\n81 \\n \\nCC2 shown in Figure 2. The multiple peaks at ~ 7.9 ppm are assigned to the protons \\non aromatic rings of CC2 with 12H. The chemical shifts at 3.5, 3.9 and 4.1 ppm are \\nconsistent with protons on the cage bridges and they are multiple peaks with 6H for \\neach one. The methyl groups exhibit a chemical shift of 1.3 ppm with 18H. The \\npeaks with chemical shifts at 2.1 ppm and 1.56 ppm are the solvent acetonitrile and \\nH2O, respectively, in Figure 3 (red). In terms of \\n1\\nHNMR spectroscopy of desolvated \\nCC2 in Figure 3 (blue), the solvent acetonitrile peak at 2.1 ppm was not observed \\nwhich shows solvents have been removed. \\n \\nFigure 3. \\n1\\nH-NMR spectra of solvated (Red) and desolvated (Blue) CC2. \\n(CDCl3 at 7.27 ppm, H2O at 1.56 ppm and TMS at 0 ppm) \\nA further analysis of the coupling between the methyl group CH3 protons and the CH \\nproton on the cage vertices was investigated using \\n1\\nH COSY NMR (Figure 4). The \\nCOSY analysis can assign the peaks at 3.5, 3.9 and 4.1 ppm, respectively, to the \\nprotons on the cage vertices. The protons on the cage vertices are labelled as H1, H2 \\nand H3 as shown in the picture. A coupling between the methyl group CH3 protons \\nat 1.3 ppm and the CH proton at 3.9 ppm, was observed which is the proton H2. A \\ncoupling was also observed at 3.5 and 4.1 ppm which corresponded to the CH2 group \\nprotons, H1 and H3.  \\nDesolvated CC2 \\nSolvated CC2 \\nCrystalline Porous Organic Cage – CC2 \\n82 \\n \\n \\nFigure 4. \\n1\\nH COSY NMR spectrum for CC2. \\nThe \\n13\\nC NMR spectra of solvated and desolvated samples are shown in Figure 5. The \\n13\\nC chemical shifts of the imine bonds were observed at 161.0, 160.9, 159.3 and \\n159.1 ppm. The peaks at 136.5, 129.7, 129.6, 129.5 and 129.4 ppm were assigned to \\ncarbons on aromatic rings. The methyl groups on the cage vertices can result in \\ndifferent structural isomers for CC2, therefore, different carbon environments for \\nimine bonds and aromatic rings were observed. The chemical shifts at 68.4 and 66.8 \\nppm are consistent with carbons on the cage bridges.  The methyl groups have a \\nchemical shift of 20.9 ppm. The peaks with chemical shifts at 116.4 ppm and 1.89 \\nppm are the solvent acetonitrile. No solvent peaks were observed in desolvated CC2 \\n13\\nC NMR in Figure 5 (red).  \\nH1 \\nH2 \\nH3 \\nCrystalline Porous Organic Cage – CC2 \\n83 \\n \\n \\nFigure 5. \\n13\\nC NMR spectra of solvated (Blue) and desolvated (Red) CC2. \\n                                                     (CDCl3 at 77 ppm) \\n3.4.2 Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) for CC2 \\nThe solvated and desolvated samples were prepared as KBr disks for 16 scans with a \\nresolution of 4 cm\\n-1\\n FTIR analysis. Spectra were recorded in transmission mode \\n(Figure 6). FTIR spectra for both solvated and desolvated samples show a strong \\nimine stretch at 1640 cm\\n-1\\n. Both materials have similar IR stretches and intensities. \\nThe C=O stretch at 1720 cm\\n-1\\n was not observed, indicating no unreacted 1,3,5-\\ntriformylbenzene. In addition, the solvent CH3CN absorption at 2240-2260 cm\\n-1\\n was \\nnot found for either solvated and desolvated samples, whereas OH stretching \\noccurred at ~ 3500 cm\\n-1\\n indicating the presence of water molecules. There is no \\nchange of IR spectra after desolvation. This is because desolvation of CC2 occurs \\nspontaneously at ambient temperature. As such, some solvent is inevitably lost prior \\nto FTIR analysis of the “solvated” sample.  \\nDesolvated CC2\\nSolvated CC2\\n-CH=N\\n-Ar\\n-CH=N\\n-Ar\\nCDCl3\\n-CH\\n-CH3\\nTMS\\n-CH\\nTMS\\nCH3CN\\n-CH3\\nCrystalline Porous Organic Cage – CC2 \\n84 \\n \\n \\nFigure 6. FTIR spectra for solvated and desolvated CC2. \\n3.4.3 Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) for CC2 \\nThis rapid loss of solvent for as-synthesized CC2 was further confirmed by TGA \\nanalysis under nitrogen flow. TGA was carried out using a nitrogen flow and heating \\nrate of 5 ºC / min. CC2 desolvates rapidly and spontaneously at ambient temperature \\nto lose the solvent, CH3CN. Therefore, the TGA analysis is similar for both solvated \\nand desolvated samples in Figure 7. The small mass loss observed for the as-\\nsynthesized sample is most likely attributed to water molecules. The onset of \\ndecomposition for the desolvated sample occurs at 349 °C (622 K). The CC2 \\nmaterial has a relative good thermal stability, comparable with many metal organic \\nframeworks.  \\n4000 3500 3000 2500 2000 1500 1000 500\\nT\\nra\\nn\\ns\\nm\\nis\\ns\\nio\\nn\\nWavenumber / cm-1\\n CC2 desolvated\\n CC2 solvated\\nCrystalline Porous Organic Cage – CC2 \\n85 \\n \\n \\nFigure 7.

SEM images (a) and optical microscope images (b) for desolvated crystals \\nof CC2. Scale bars for SEM images are 5 µm and 100 µm, respectively. Scale bars \\nfor optical microscope images are 200 µm and 50 µm, respectively. Images were \\ncollected by Dr Tom Hasell. \\nSingle crystal X-ray data of CC2 were collected and refined by Dr John Bacsa. The \\nanalysis shows that the molecules crystallize in the trigonal system with the space \\ngroup, P-3. The unit cell is: a = b = 18.770(3) Å, c = 10.921(2) Å, and cell volume is \\n3332.1 Å\\n3\\n. The unit cell contains three solvent accessible voids, two smaller ones \\nwith a volume 158 Å\\n3\\n inside the cage voids, and a larger void corresponding to the \\nchannel with a volume 568 Å\\n3\\n per unit cell. The electron density from X-ray \\ndiffraction suggested that guest molecules were accommodated in the solvent \\naccessible voids, but the diffraction had a low resolution. No ordered guests could be \\nlocated and refined. The SQUEEZE method in PLATON calculated a total of 100 \\nelectrons for guest molecules.\\n3\\n TGA and FTIR showed no CH3CN solvents observed \\ndue to the solvent loss spontaneously at ambient temperature (Figures 6 and 7), but \\nwater molecules might adsorb in the material.\\n4\\n Approximately 6 H2O molecules per \\nunit cell were estimated.  \\na \\nb \\nCrystalline Porous Organic Cage – CC2 \\n87 \\n \\nThe isolated CC2 molecule exhibits [4+6] tetrahedral symmetry shown in Figure 9 (a) \\nwhich is analogous to CC1.\\n1\\n Four C6H3(CN)3 units of planar threefold symmetry are \\nlinked by six 1,2-propylenediamine vertices. The methyl groups on the propylene \\nvertices are disordered. A vertex of CC2 shows two possible locations for the methyl \\ngroup, the exo and endo sites as shown in Figure 9 (b). The exo positions are pointing \\naway from the cage and the endo positions are towards cage window.  The positional \\ndisordered methyl group occupied at the exo-site per vertex observed in the crystal \\nstructure. The geometry optimization calculation for CC2 molecule with one methyl \\ngroup occupied at the endo site was performed by DMol3 in the Materials Studio \\nModelling 5.0 software package (Accelrys) with GGA, PBE functional and TNP \\nbasis set. Energy calculations show that that the exo-site is energetically favoured by \\n30 kJ/mol over the endo-site due to the steric interactions between the endo-methyl \\ngroup and the hydrogen attached to the imine-carbon. \\nCrystalline Porous Organic Cage – CC2 \\n88 \\n \\n \\nFigure 9.

The \\nisolated cage voids are also generated due to the window to arene stacks of cage \\nmolecules. The channels and cage voids have a lack of formal connection because no \\ncage windows facing towards the channels.

The 1D channel has a diameter of \\na \\nb \\nCrystalline Porous Organic Cage – CC2 \\n89 \\n \\n6.2 Å at the neck point which is defined by the methyl groups on neighbouring cages \\nand a diameter of 14 Å at the widest point.

CC2 powder X-ray diffraction patterns \\nThe phase purity of bulk CC2 was confirmed from powder X-ray diffraction \\n(PXRD). A comparison of the PXRD patterns recorded for the solvated and \\ndesolvated samples alongside the simulated pattern from the single-crystal structure \\nis shown in Figure 11. The simulated PXRD was obtained using the Material Studio \\n5.0 powder pattern refinements. The as-synthesized sample was treated overnight at \\n120 °C under the vacuum before gas sorption. Therefore, the sample after gas \\nsorption can be considered to be the desolvated sample. The X-ray patterns have no \\nsignificant change between the as-synthesized and after gas sorption samples. This \\nreveals that the CC2 structure remains nearly intact after desolvation. Compared \\nwith the simulated PXRD pattern, the experimental PXRD patterns show the same \\npeak positions.  Therefore, the single crystal structure is representative of the bulk \\nmaterials. \\nCrystalline Porous Organic Cage – CC2 \\n91 \\n \\n \\nFigure 11. Powder X-ray diffraction patterns for as-synthesized (middle) and after \\ngas sorption (top) samples. The simulated PXRD from single crystal X-ray \\ndiffraction data is shown in the bottom as a comparison. \\n3.4.6 CC2 gas sorption analysis \\nGas sorption measurements for CC2 were carried out. The sample was heated to 120 \\nºC under dynamic vacuum for 12 hours to fully desolvate and degas the sample \\nbefore gas sorption analysis. The sample retains crystallinity and no phase changes \\noccur upon desolvation according to the PXRD patterns. N2 sorption measurement \\nfor CC2 at 77.3 K showed a Type I isotherm indicating a permanent microporosity \\n(Figure 12 A). The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller surface area of CC2 is 533 m\\n2\\n g\\n-1\\n and \\nthe Langmuir surface area calculated is 600 m\\n2\\n g\\n-1\\n, as calculated from the N2 \\nadsorption isotherm. The BET and Langmuir methods were applied in the relative \\npressure range of 0.01-0.10, R\\n2\\n = 0.9999 and C value = 2372.  \\nThe total N2 uptake for CC2 is 168.5 cm\\n3\\n g\\n-1\\n (corresponding to 7.5 mmol g\\n-1\\n) at a \\nrelative pressure (P/P0) of 0.998 and 77.3 K (Figure 12 (A)) in comparison with 3.8 \\nmmol g\\n-1\\n for cucurbit[6]uril,\\n9\\n 4.0 mmol g\\n-1\\n for 1,2-dimethoxy-p-tert-\\nbutylcalix[4]dihydroquinone\\n10\\n and 4.4 mmol g\\n-1\\n for 3,3′,4,4′-\\ntetra(trimethylsilylethynyl)biphenyl \\n11\\n under comparable conditions. However the N2 \\nCrystalline Porous Organic Cage – CC2 \\n92 \\n \\nuptake of CC2 is lower than other [4+6] imine cage molecules reported more \\nrecently in our group and the Mastalerz group. \\n12\\n  \\nCC2 adsorbed 132.2 cm\\n3\\n g\\n-1\\n (5.9 mmol g\\n-1\\n) H2 at 77.3K, 1 bar in Figure 12 (B) and \\nfurther H2 analysis for CC2 showed 198.9 cm\\n3\\n g\\n-1\\n (8.9 mmol g\\n-1\\n) uptakes at 77.3 K \\nand 7 bar. By comparison, a salicylbisimine cage compound synthesized by \\nMastalerz, et al. exhibited a BET surface area of 1375 m\\n2\\n g\\n-1\\n and H2 uptake of 5.6 \\nmmol g\\n-1\\n at 77 K and 1 bar.\\n12c\\n Although the BET surface area of CC2 is low, the H2 \\nuptake of CC2 exceeds reports for other porous organic molecules.\\n2, 9-11, 13\\n \\nCC2 also adsorbed substantial quantities of CO2 and CH4 at the ambient temperature. \\nThe CH4 sorption capability was 21.3 cm\\n3\\n g\\n-1\\n (0.9 mmol g\\n-1\\n) at 287 K, 1 bar and 67.2 \\ncm\\n3\\n g\\n-1\\n (3.0 mmol g\\n-1\\n) CO2 uptake was observed at 275K, 1 bar (Figure 12 (C-D)). \\nThe CC2 demonstrates a high CO2 uptake of 3.0 mmol g\\n-1\\n compared with other \\nimine cages at 1 bar and 275 K such as 2.1 mmol g\\n-1\\n for the salicylbisimine cage \\n12c\\n \\nand 2.5 mmol g\\n-1\\n for CC3.\\n1\\n All of the isotherms were repeated on different batches \\nof samples. \\n \\nFigure 12.

Conclusions \\nPorous organic cage (CC2) was synthesized from 1,3,5-triformylbenzene and 1,2-\\npropylenediamine. The synthesis is one step and the products, which directly \\ncrystallize from CH3CN solvents, can be characterized by single X-ray diffraction. \\nThe shape-persistent cage molecule shows tetrahedral symmetry. Four positional \\nisomers of CC2 were observed due to disordered methyl groups on the cage vertices.  \\nUnlike CC1, the methyl groups direct the crystal packing to give a 1D channel \\nrunning between the cages. The voids in the cages are isolated due to lack of \\ninterconnecting to the channel. As a result, the porosity in CC2 results from the \\nisolated voids in the cages (intrinsic porosity) and the inefficient packing of these \\nmolecules (extrinsic porosity). The CC2 material demonstrates permanent porosity \\n0 10 20 30 40 50\\n-0.002\\n0.000\\n0.002\\n0.004\\n0.006\\n0.008\\n0.010\\n0.012\\n0.014\\n0.016\\n0.018\\nÅ15.6\\nÅ9.9\\nD\\nif\\nfe\\nre\\nn\\nti\\na\\nl \\nV\\no\\nlu\\nm\\ne\\n (\\nc\\nm\\n³/\\ng\\n)\\nPore Width/ Å\\n CC2\\nCrystalline Porous Organic Cage – CC2 \\n94 \\n \\nupon desolvation with a BET surface area of 533 m\\n2\\n/g and microporous volume of \\n0.26 cm\\n3\\n/g.

Jiang, et al., Chemical Communications 2011, 47, 8919-8921. Gas separation and \\nmolecular recognition are important in industry for energy and environmental \\napplications, such as flue gas purification and carbon capture.1 A variety of porous \\nmaterials have been explored in this regard such as zeolites,2 MOFs,1b and porous \\npolymers.3 The effect of gas selectivity in porous materials can be ascribed to several \\nfactors including the pore size or shape of materials, the interaction between the gas \\nmolecule and pore surfaces, gas diffusivities in porous systems, and kinetic effects.4 \\nOne approach to gas separation is to design materials with well-defined pore \\nstructures, which allow the diffusion of the target adsorbate molecule but not other \\nmolecules. However, it is difficult to obtain selectivity between adsorbate molecules \\nwith similar sizes. Additionally, another method to achieve selective adsorption is to \\nincrease the affinity of porous materials for a particular target adsorbate molecule by \\nfunctionalization of the absorbent surface.  \\nAs discussed in the Chapter One, porous organic molecules have gained a \\nconsiderable attention in the last few years.5 Furthermore, some studies have focused \\non porous organic molecules that are capable of selective guest binding in particular \\nwith respect to gas separations.6 Here is a brief literature review on gas selectivity in \\nporous organic molecules. p-tert-Butylcalix[4]arene is a well known molecular \\ncrystal which possesses large lattice voids. The material absorbed much more CO2 \\nthan H2 as reported by Atwood et al.7 It was found that the CO2 occupancy in the \\ncavities of the crystal is 100 % at 3 atmospheres of CO2. In contrast, the material \\nshowed only a small amount of H2 adsorption at a pressure of up to 7 atm at the same \\ntemperature. Thus, p-tert-butylcalix[4]arene can be used to purify a H2/CO2 mixture.7 \\nLikewise, the molecular crystal tris(o-phenylenedioxy)cyclophosphazene (TPP) has a \\none-dimensional (1-D) pore channel which is generated by molecular hexagonal \\npacking. It was found that TPP adsorbed large amounts of CO2 and CH4 compared to \\nN2 and H2.8 An uptake of 0.7 mol of CH4 per mol of TPP at 1 atm and 195 K was \\nobserved. The CO2 uptake is 1.24 mol CO2 per mol of TPP at 1 atm and 195 K. \\nHowever, the material exhibited a very low uptake of H2, N2, O2 and Ar under \\ncomparable conditions. The NMR study indicated that CH4 and CO2 gas molecules \\nresided in the 1D channel and had a close contact with the surrounding aromatic \\nSelective Gas Sorption in a [2+3] ‘Propeller ’Cage Crystal \\n98 \\n \\nrings of the TPP. Organic molecular cucurbit [6] uril (CB[6] ) with 1D channels was \\nstudied by Kim et al.9 The material showed a BET surface area of 210 m2/g, as \\ncalculated from the N2 isotherm, and adsorbed a large amount of acetylene.9 \\nFurthermore, cucurbit[6]uril was also shown to selectively adsorb CO2 over CO \\nwhere selectivity of CO2 over CO was rationalised on the basis of the high enthalpy \\nof CO2 adsorption by Kim et al.10 Atwood et al. reported amorphous cucurbit[7]uril \\n(CB [7]) for highly selective CO2 uptake over N2 and CH4.11 The material showed a \\nhigh CO2 sorption capacity of 50 cm3/g at 1 bar and 297 K which exceeded those of \\nany known organic molecules. Mastalerz et al.12 described a [4+6] salicylbisimine \\ncage with a Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area of 1377 m2/g. This \\nsalicylbisimine cage has an internal volume of approximately 678 Å3 and crystal \\nstructure showed a 3D interconnected pore volume. This material showed a \\npreference for CO2 over CH4. The CO2/CH4 selectivity was 10/1 at 1 bar, 273 K.12 \\nOur group recently demonstrated the gas selectivity by a [4+6] tetrahedral imine cage \\nmolecule, cage 1 (CC1). This cage can interconvert in the solid state between three \\npolymorphs which are non-porous to both N2 and H2 (CC1α), selectively porous to \\nH2 only (CC1β), and non-selectively porous to both N2 and H2 (CC1γ), \\nrespectively.13 The gas selectivity in CC1β can be attributed to the crystal packing. \\nRecently, Mastalerz et al. has carried out a study to investigate the influence of the \\nrigidity of the cage molecular structures on porosity.14 The [2+3] cage compounds \\nwere synthesized by an imine condensation of triptycene triamine and \\nbissalicylaldehyde.14 One of [2+3] cage compounds consisting of rigid subunits \\nadsorbs 286 cm3g-1 of N2 at 77 K and P/Po = 0.95 and the calculated BET surface \\narea is 744 m2 g-1. By contrast, the other large and flexible [2+3] cage compound \\nshows a low level of porosity with a BET surface area of 30 m2 g-1. Interestingly, it \\nexhibits a high uptake of CO2 at 298 K and 1 bar and results in a high selectivity of \\n10 (mmol/mmol) or 29 (w t %/wt %) for CO2 over CH4.14  \\nCO2 capture and storage from flue gases is an important objective. To achieve the \\nrequired adsorption capacity and separation, materials need a high selectivity for CO2 \\nover other fuel gas components and a high surface affinity for CO2.15 Zhang et al.6a \\nsynthesized a shape-persistent organic cage molecule in a [2+3] cycloimination \\nreaction. The cage molecule has a very small internal void and the packing diagram \\nshows that the molecules pack close to each other in a layered structure form. The \\nSelective Gas Sorption in a [2+3] ‘Propeller ’Cage Crystal \\n99 \\n \\ncrystalline [2+3] cage material showed a low gas uptake of CO2 and H2 at 1 bar and \\n20 ºC. The uptake value of CO2 was 4.46 cm3/g, whereas the material hardly \\nadsorbed N2 (0.061 cm3g-1). However, the material displayed a high ideal CO2/N2 \\n(CO2/N2 = 73/1) adsorption selectivity at 1 bar and 20 ºC. In addition, the imine \\nreduction reaction for the cage molecule was carried out. The CO2/N2 adsorption \\nselectivity for the amine cage material at 1 bar and 20 ºC decreased to 39/1. The \\nauthors suggested that the good gas selectivity was attributed to well-defined pore \\nstructure and the strong interaction of CO2 with the imine groups of the cage \\nmolecules. The same research group also reported a series of related [2+3] cage \\ncompounds with different sizes of internal cavities which exhibited ideal CO2/N2 \\nselectivity in the range from 36/1 to 138/1 at 20 ºC and 1 bar.6b Although the actual \\nCO2 adsorption capacity of these [2+3] cage molecules at 1 bar and 20 ºC is much \\nlower than other organic molecules published,12, 16 the selectivity is extraordinarily \\nhigh. Moreover, a series of organic cage frameworks were reported by Zhang et al.17  \\nThe ideal selectivity of CO2/N2 was up to 213/1 at 1 bar and 20 ºC. \\nIn this Chapter, the synthesis and characterization of a new ‘propeller’ shaped porous \\norganic cage molecule CC6 will be introduced. The cage molecule has a [2+3] \\ntopology which is synthesized from the condensation reaction of 1,3,5-tri-(4-\\nformylphenyl)benzene with 1,5-pentanediamine. The resulting molecular crystal is \\ndetermined by NMR, PXRD, single crystal XRD and gas sorption isotherms. The \\ncage molecule has a compact structure with a little void inside the cage. A narrow 1D \\nchannel is formed by molecular ineffective packing. The material demonstrates \\nselective adsorption of hydrogen and carbon dioxide over nitrogen. The gas \\nselectivity can be rationalized by pore connectivity on the basis of the crystal \\nstructure. A trade-off between sorption capacity and selectivity is observed for \\nmaterials in this class.  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nSelective Gas Sorption in a [2+3] ‘Propeller ’Cage Crystal \\n100 \\n \\n4.2 Synthesis of the starting monomer (1,3,5-tri-(4-formylphenyl) benzene) \\n4.2.1 Synthetic procedure \\nB CHO\\nBr\\nBr Br\\n+\\nPd(OAc)2, PPh3\\nNa2CO3 (aq)\\n1-propanol, ref lux\\nH\\nO\\nH O\\nH\\nO\\nHO\\nHO\\n \\nScheme 1. 1,3,5-Tri-(4-formylphenyl) benzene as synthesized by Suzuki coupling. \\nAs illustrated in the previous chapter, porous [4+6] imine cages were synthesized by \\nthe condensation reaction of 1,3,5-triformylbenzene and diamine. The motivation of \\nthis work was attempting to select commercial available or synthetic available \\nmonomers to discover more cage-like molecules and explore the gas sorption \\nproperties of the materials. 1, 3, 5-tri-(4-formylphenyl) benzene monomer and 1,5-\\npentanedaimine were chosen for the cage synthesis in this chapter. The synthesis of \\nmonomer, 1,3,5-tri-(4-formylphenyl) benzene was optimised at the bench \\nexperiments (Scheme 1) by Dr Xiaofeng Wu and it was then scaled up by using \\nChemSpeed SLT106 system to perform multiple parallel reactions and extraction \\nsteps. \\nOptimized procedure on bench scale: \\nAn oven-dried 150 mL, two necked round bottom Radley flask equipped with a \\nmagnetic stir bar was flushed with N2 gas and cooled to room temperature under a N2 \\nflow. Tribromobenzene (1.0 g, 3.18 mmol), 4-formylphenylboronic acid (1.7 g, 11.5 \\nmmol), Pd(OAc)2 (3 mg, 0.013 mmol), and PPh3 (6 mg, 0.026 mmol) were added. \\nAfter degassing this mixture three times, 1-propanol (20 mL) was added under N2. \\nThe solution was left stirring at 60 °C until all of the solids dissolved. Once the clear \\nsolution turned to pale yellow (ca. 15 min), a solution of Na2CO3 (2M, 6 mL) and \\nwater (5 mL) were added under N2. The resulting mixture was then heated to reflux \\nfor 2 h under N2. The nitrogen sources were removed after reflux and another portion \\nof water (20 mL) was added. The reaction mixture was left under stirring, open to the \\nSelective Gas Sorption in a [2+3] ‘Propeller ’Cage Crystal \\n101 \\n \\nair for 5 h at room temperature. The mixture was then extracted with chloroform (30 \\nmL) and the organic layers were washed with a 2 wt% solution of NaHCO3 (25 mL). \\nA spoonful of activated charcoal was added into the organic solution and the mixture \\nwas stirred for 30 min at room temperature. The suspension was filtered through \\ncelite under reduced pressure. Evaporation of the solvent gave the crude product. The \\npure product was obtained after column chromatography with 70 % yield, or \\nrecrystallized from THF with 65 % yield. The calculated mass calculated for \\nC27H18O3: 390.13.

Melting point is 245-251°C (literature \\nvalue 231-232 °C).18 \\nSynthesis procedure using ChemSpeed synthesis robot for scale up: \\nFollowing the optimised procedure of bench scale synthesis, a Chemspeed workflow \\nwas developed by Dr Xiaofeng Wu and Dr Sean Higgins as follows. The reaction \\nprocedure is illustrated in Figure 1. This process was followed for the synthesis of \\nthe starting monomer, 1,3,5-tri-(4-formylphenyl) benzene.  \\n1) Figure 1(a) shows a picture of the robot with a 2 x 4 reaction block. 100 mL \\nreactors were used. \\n2) The four solid starting materials were added into each reactor shown in \\nFigure 1(b-c). \\n3) The reactors were then purged with nitrogen which was kept on for the whole \\nreaction time. \\n4) 1-Propanol was added to each reactor and the reactions were heated to 60 °C \\nfor 15 mins to form a homogeneous solution shown in Figure 1(d). The \\nsynthesizer was equipped with a vortex movement of the reactors in Figure \\n1(e).  \\n5) Na2CO3 solution was added to start the reaction, followed by further aliquots \\nof water.  The reaction was heated to reflux  at 100 °C for 2 hours with rapid \\nvortexing  \\n6) Once cooled down, chloroform solvent extraction was carried out and the \\ncrude product was placed to a collection bottle shown in Figure 1(f). \\nSelective Gas Sorption in a [2+3] ‘Propeller ’Cage Crystal \\n102 \\n \\n7) Automated cleaning and drying of the reaction flasks for repeat use. \\nSpecific details and parameters for each of these steps are recorded within the \\nsoftware. \\n \\nFigure 1.

The multiple peaks at ~ 8.04-7.87 ppm are assigned to \\naromatic rings (-ArH) with 15 H. Chemical shifts at 4.12, 2.05 and 1.06 ppm are \\nattributed to EtOAc solvent. δ 1.60 is H2O solvent. \\nThe 13C NMR spectrum is shown in Figure 3. The 13C chemical shift of the –CHO is \\nobserved at 191.76 ppm. The peaks 146.29, 141.60, 135.76, 130.44, 127.98, 126.48 \\nppm are assigned to carbons on aromatic rings.

The cage \\nproducts directly crystallized from the solution. It was found that the solvents had a \\nsignificant effect on the cage formation. The test reactions were therefore carried out \\nto examine the reactions of 1,3,5-tri-(4-formylphenyl) benzene with a series of \\ndiamines in various solvents. Chloroform (CHCl3), dichloromethane (DCM), \\nmethanol (MeOH), ethyl acetate (EtOAc) and acetonitrile (CH3CN) were chosen as \\nsolvents for this study. The parallel reactions were performed using 1,3,5-tri-(4-\\nformylphenyl) benzene  (20 mg, 0.051 mmol) with a series of  diamines (0.076 mmol) \\nin 30 mL solution. Table 1 summarises the products from these test reactions. It was \\nobserved that all the reactions in EtOAc or CH3CN produced insoluble products \\nwhich might be polymers. The reactions of 1,3,5-tri-(4-formylphenyl) benzene with \\n1,3-propanediamine or 1,4-butanediamine in CHCl3, DCM and MeOH, respectively, \\nformed partially soluble oligomers. The complicated NMR shows no CHO protons at \\nchemical shift of 10.11 ppm for the starting monomer trialdehyde and multiple peaks \\nat 8.16 ppm which are assigned to imine protons in Figure 4. The products could be \\nin the intermediate state, and no evidence was found for forming cage molecules. \\nCrystals were obtained by the reactions of 1,3,5-tri-(4-formylphenyl) benzene with \\n1,2-ethylenediamine in MeOH. However, single crystal XRD confirmed that the \\nproducts were a 1,3,5-tri-(4-formylphenyl) benzene derivative as shown in Figure 5. \\nThe reaction by 1,3,5-tri-(4-formylphenyl) benzene and 1,5-pentanediamine, by \\ncontrast,  gave a macrocyclic cage molecule.  \\nIn this Chapter, the cage material is synthesized by 1,3,5-tri-(4-formylphenyl) \\nbenzene and 1,5-pentanediamine in MeOH solvent due to crystal structure available. \\nThe solvent effect on the reaction will be discussed in the 4.4 section.   \\n \\n \\nSelective Gas Sorption in a [2+3] ‘Propeller ’Cage Crystal \\n105 \\n \\nTable 1.

The product obtained from the reaction of 1, 3, 5-tri-(4-formylphenyl) \\nbenzene with 1, 2-ethylenediamine determined from single crystal XRD. \\n[2+3] ‘Propeller’ cage synthesis procedure: \\nMethanol (20 mL) was added to 1,3,5-tri-(4-formylphenyl) benzene (50 mg, \\n0.128mmol) in a sample vial at room temperature. A solution of 1,5-pentanediamine \\n(20 mg, 0.192 mmol) in MeOH (20 mL) was added slowly. The reaction was left \\ncovered for 6-7 days without stirring. The products were observed to crystallize from \\nsolution. The crystals were separated carefully from the sample vial using a spatula \\nSelective Gas Sorption in a [2+3] ‘Propeller ’Cage Crystal \\n107 \\n \\nand washed with MeOH and air dried to give the solvated [2+3] cage. The synthesis \\nof cage molecule is shown in Scheme 2. Crystals suitable for X-ray crystallography \\nwere removed directly from the sample vial. To desolvate [2+3] cage, a sample was \\nheated to 100 ˚C under dynamic vacuum for 12 hours. The yield after desolvation \\nwas 45 %. Mass spectrometry showed [CC6 + H]+ and [CC6 + Na]+ ions at m/z = \\n979.49 and 1001.48, consistent with a [2+3] cage structure composed of two units of \\n1 and three units of 2 with formula C69H66N6. In previous work, we showed the \\ncycloimination reaction between 1,3,5-triformylbenzene and either ethylenediamine, \\n1,2-propylenediamine, or 1,2-cyclohexanediamine led to the formation of [4+6] cage \\nstructures. Here, a [2+3] cage structure was observed instead. This can be ascribed to \\nboth the greater flexibility of the 1,5-pentanediamine and also the larger size of the \\ntrialdehyde. \\nScheme 2.

Compound \\nCC6 crystallized directly from the reaction mixture as colorless, plate-like prisms. \\nThe crystal size was suitable for single crystal X-ray diffraction. The analysis \\nshowed that the molecules crystallized in the orthorhombic system with the chiral \\nspace group Pca21. The unit cell is: a = 26.055 Å, b = 15.571 Å, c = 14.686 Å and \\ncell volume is 5958.3 Å3. The solvated crytal structure was measured and refined at \\n100 K. Furthermore, the crystal was heated to 395 K in situ in the diffractometer for \\ndesovlation. After colling to 100 K to collect desolvated crystal data, the diffraction \\nwas too weak to refine the structure. Therefore, the desolvated structure is not \\navailable for CC6. All crystal and refinement details are listed in Table 2. \\n \\n \\n \\nA B \\nC \\nSelective Gas Sorption in a [2+3] ‘Propeller ’Cage Crystal \\n110 \\n \\nTable 2. Crystal and refinement data for CC6. \\n \\nA [2+3] cage molecule (CC6) was observed and the cage molecule has pseudo 3-fold \\nsymmetry shown in Figure 9. CC6 resembles a three-bladed propeller and is chiral \\ndue to a helical twist. Two of the three pentyl linkers are disordered, and this disorder \\ncould be modeled effectively by splitting each of these atoms into two distinct sites \\nand restraining the equivalent 1, 2 and 1, 3 bond distances to be similar. Even though \\ntwo 1,3,5-phenyl benzene groups are separated by pentyl linkers, CC6 has a compact \\nstructure with little void space inside the cage. The distance between the two central \\nphenyl rings is 3.7 Å, which is typical for pi-pi stacking. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nSelective Gas Sorption in a [2+3] ‘Propeller ’Cage Crystal \\n111 \\n \\n \\n          \\nFigure 9.

The distance between two layers in the crystal is approximately \\n5 Å. CC6 assembles in the solid state to generate 1-D channels along the a-axis \\nresulting from imperfect packing of the propeller-shaped molecules. The Connolly \\nsurface area of CC6 generated using a N2 radius of 1.82 Å is shown in Figure 10d-e. \\nThese channels are relatively narrow and constitute approximately 10 % of the \\nvolume of the structure. The MeOH solvent molecules can be identified as electron \\ndensity within these voids, but these guests were only partially resolved and too \\ndisordered to be modeled effectively. The data was therefore treated by using \\nPLATON/SQUEEZE 19 which calculates six MeOH molecules per cage molecule. \\nThe pi -stacked layers run perpendicular to the 1-D MeOH-filled channels.

Therefore, the sample after gas sorption can be labeled as \\na desolvated sample. Figure 13 shows there are no significant differences between \\nsolvated and desolvated PXRD patterns. Consequently, the molecular structure \\nremained nearly intact after desolvation. Compared with experimental diffraction \\nSelective Gas Sorption in a [2+3] ‘Propeller ’Cage Crystal \\n116 \\n \\ndata, the simulated pattern of the single crystal structure produced by Mercury \\nsoftware showed systematic shifts in the peak positions due to thermal expansion, \\nbecause the single crystal and PXRD data were collected at different temperatures. \\nThe single crystal X-ray data was determined at 100 K and PXRD data recorded at \\nthe room temperature.  \\nIn addition, the Le Bail fitting of PXRD was carried out by Dr James T.

The \\ngas sorption isotherms were measured by Dr James T. A. Jones and Dr Robert \\nDawson. The material was heated to 100 ˚C under dynamic vacuum for 12 hours to \\nfully desolvate before gas sorption analysis. CC6 is stable under these conditions, \\nwith no apparent loss of crystallinity. N2 sorption measurements at 77 K showed a \\npredominantly Type I isotherm (Figure 16a black squares) with a total uptake of \\n1.5 mmol g-1 at 1 bar. The BET model applied over a pressure range of P/P0 =0.01-\\n0.1 gives a surface area of 99 m2g-1. This is substantially lower than the [4+6] imine-\\nbased cages reported previously16 because CC6 exhibits only extrinsic porosity \\n(between cages) and no intrinsic porosity (within the cages). CC6 adsorbed 3.8 \\nmmol g-1 of H2 at 77 K and 1.2 bar (Figure 16a red circles) and saturation was not \\nreached. Some hysteresis was observed in the H2 isotherm upon desorption, which \\nwas attributed to the narrow pores which restrict H2 diffusion.  \\nGas sorption measurements were also carried out closer to ambient temperature. The \\nN2 adsorption isotherm at 300 K and 1.2 bar revealed a low gas uptake (0.08 mmol g-\\n1) shown in Figure 16b black squares. By contrast, the CO2 uptake for CC6 was 0.9 \\nmmol g-1 (Figure 16b red circles) under the same conditions, significantly greater \\nthan that reported for the [2+3] cage prepared by Zhang et al.6 (0.1–0.25 mmol g-1). \\nThis adsorption behaviour suggests that CC6 or analogues might be candidates for \\ngas separation applications. The ideal selectivity was calculated from these isotherms \\nto be 11 for CO2/N2 at 300 K and 1 bar.

The selectivity can be considered as a function of sorption capacity. \\nFigure 17 shows a plot of ideal selectivity (CO2/N2) versus CO2 uptakes for a series \\nof porous materials. There is a clear trade-off between them. Increased CO2 uptakes \\nwill lead to a decreased CO2/N2 selectivity. The selection of materials in this plot \\nincludes porous organic cages reported by our group (CC),13, 16, 20 cage compounds \\nsynthesized by the Zhang group (ZC)6b and a selection of MOFs21 which show \\nCO2/N2 selectivity. Examples were chosen where the gas uptakes were measured \\nunder comparable conditions. Table 3 lists that the values of N2, CO2 uptakes and \\nideal selectivity (CO2/N2) for these materials. Although the CO2 adsorption capacity \\nof [2+3] cage molecules by Zhang et al. is much lower, the selectivity is \\nextraordinarily high (red circles in Figure 17) which are top left side of the plot. For \\npractical separation in industry, both uptake and selectivity need be considered. The \\nplot shows a similar behaviour observed for gas permeable membranes, where there \\nis a trade off between selectivity and permeability, as described in detail by \\nRobeson.22 To achieve the required adsorption capacity and separation, the future \\nchallenge is to discover materials with both high selectivity and gas uptake, which \\nwill be at the top right side of the plot in Figure 17. \\n \\n \\nSelective Gas Sorption in a [2+3] ‘Propeller ’Cage Crystal \\n121 \\n \\n \\nFigure 17.

Using a probe radius of 1.72 Å for CO2, a 1-D \\nchannel was observed but a narrow restricted neck to this side pore was observed \\n(Figure 18 middle). The Connolly surface obtained using with a N2 probe radius of \\n1.82 Å also demonstrated a narrow, restricted 1-D channel, but in this case the ‘side \\npore’ was not connected to the channel (Figure 18 below). This could rationalize the \\nlower uptake for N2 and also the relatively high H2 uptake observed at 77 K.  \\nNon local density functional theory (NL-DFT) pore size distribution curves is \\nobtained from the N2 adsorption isotherm at 77 K. The material has a 14 Å pore size \\nshown in Figure 19a. The 1D pore channels are represented by Connolly surfaces \\ngenerated using a N2 probe of 1.82 Å in Figure 19b. The diameter of these channels \\nbased Connolly surfaces is about 3.9 Å. The diameter of side pores is ~ 3.6 Å. An \\napproximate pore channel length of 14.5 Å can be defined as the distance between \\ntwo necks in the continuous 1-D channels; this is consistent with the measured pore \\nsize distribution of 14 Å based on the N2 isotherm.

Other topological structures for the cage \\na\\nb\\nSelective Gas Sorption in a [2+3] ‘Propeller ’Cage Crystal \\n126 \\n \\nmolecule by combining the triangle shape component (1, 3, 5-tri-(4-formylphenyl \\nbenzene) and linear component (1, 5-pentanediamine) might be tetrahedron ([4+6]) \\nor cube ([8+12]), as shown in Figure 20. Initially, the reactions were tested in \\ndifferent solvents including CHCl3, DCM and MeOH in order to check the effect of \\nsolvent on the cage formation. The experimental results showed that a cage \\nstoichiometry change occurred by modifying the solvent and reaction conditions.  \\n         \\nFigure 20. Two structural models of tetrahedral (a) and cube cages (b) by triangle \\nand linear building blocks. (Grey: carbon; white: hydrogen; blue: nitrogen) \\nThe new synthetic procedure  was as follows: A solution of 1,3,5-tri-(4-\\nformylphenyl) benzene (500 mg, 1.28 mmol) in DCM or CHCl3 (300 mL) was added \\ndropwise overnight to a solution of 1, 5-pentanediamine (200 mg, 1.92 mmol) in \\nDCM or CHCl3 (300 mL) in round-bottomed flask. The flask was cooled in an ice \\nbath. After addition, the reaction was stirred for another 48 hours at room \\ntemperature. A slow addtion of reagents, low temperature and dilution solution were \\nused for the synthesis to avoid imine polymer formation. The solution was then \\nfiltered through filter paper and the solvent was removed by the rotary evaporation. \\nThe products (CC6’) were white powders with 85% yield. The NMR spectra was the \\nsame as observed for [2+3] proppeller cage. 1H NMR (CDCl3, 400MHz) δ 8.16 ppm \\n(s, 6H, CH=N), 7.51-7.28 ppm (m, 30H, -ArH), 3.68 ppm (m, 12H,-NCH), 1.77 ppm \\n(m, 12H, -CH2), 1.32 ppm (m, 6H, -CH2) ppm.13C NMR (CDCl3) δ 160.95, 142.13, \\n141.12, 134.97, 128.10, 126.82, 124.40 ppm.  \\n(a) (b)\\nSelective Gas Sorption in a [2+3] ‘Propeller ’Cage Crystal \\n127 \\n \\nHowever, mass spectrometry showed [CC6’ + Na] + ion at m/z = 1982.10, which is \\ndouble the number of [2+3] cage molecular ion. It is consistent with a [4+6] cage \\nstructure composed of four units of 1, 3, 5-tri-(4-formylphenyl) benzene and six units \\nof 1, 5-pentanediamine with formula C138H132N12 or interlocked catenated CC6. A \\n[2+3] cage molecule ion also was observed in the mass spectrometry shown in Figure \\n21.  \\n \\nFigure 21.

The reaction of 1,3,5-tri-(4-formylphenyl) benzene with 1,5-\\npentanediamine under a dilution solution, slow addition of reagents, a low \\ntemperature and DCM (CHCl3) solvent gave different products, whether these are a \\n[4+6] cage or a mixture of [2+3] and [4+6] cages or an interlocked catenane is \\ncurrently uncertain. Recrystallization was not successful to get single crystals in this \\ncase.  \\nIt would be interesting to carry on more work to control cage topology by changing \\nreaction conditions in the future. First, a HPLC methodology needs be designed to \\nanalyze and purify the cage molecules. The reaction conditions would be optimized \\nto control the cage stoichiometry change. DFT calculations can be carried out to \\nrationalize energy favourable cage topology. The correlation between gas porosity \\nand cage topology could then be studied. \\n4.5 Conclusions  \\nIn summary, it have been shown the synthesis and characterization of a [2+3] imine-\\nbased cage molecule by the condensation reaction of 1,3,5-tri-(4-formylphenyl) \\nbenzene with 1, 5-pentanediamine in MeOH solvent. The cage molecule itself \\npossesses a small cavity, but the crystal packing shows a 1D narrow channel. The \\nmaterial reveals selectivity for CO2 over N2 at modest pressures. It has an ideal \\nselectivity of 11 for CO2/N2 at 300 K, 1 bar. Additionally, it exhibits a H2/N2 \\nselectivity of 2.4 at 77 K, 1 bar. The observed gas selectivity can be rationalized by \\nmolecules packing and pore connectivity. \\nWhile the ideal selectivity of [2+3] ‘propeller’ cage is lower than other literature \\nexamples, the absolute uptakes are higher than other [2+3] imine cages. However, \\nthere is a trade-off between sorption capacity and selectivity for porous materials. \\nThe challenge will be to design materials with both high selectivity and high gas \\nuptake. \\nWhen synthesising the cage in DCM (CHCl3) it was found that solvent and reaction \\nconditions had a significant effect on the cage topology. A [4+6] cage from 1,3,5-tri-\\n(4-formylphenyl) benzene and 1,5-pentanediamine could be prepared in the future by \\noptimizing the reaction conditions.  \\nSelective Gas Sorption in a [2+3] ‘Propeller ’Cage Crystal \\n130 \\n \\n4.6 Chapter acknowledgements \\nIn this chapter, I would like to thank Andy, Dave and Abbie for their supervision and \\nsuggestions on my work.

I. Cooper, Nat. Commun. 2011, 2, 207. An alternative synthetic \\nstrategy to crystalline porous cages\\n1\\n is to generate organic cages which are \\namorphous in the solid state. There has been less focus on the field of amorphous \\nporous molecules compared with crystalline ones, because permanent porosity in \\namorphous molecular solids is extremely rare.\\n2\\n Amorphous molecular packing is not \\nreadily characterized due to lack of a periodic structure, therefore the understanding \\nand design of such materials is more challenging. However, amorphous materials \\noffer a number of potential advantages.\\n2-3\\n For example, desolvating molecular \\ncrystals often lead to a loss of porosity, which may not happen in a porous \\namorphous solid. The porosity of the materials might be further enhanced by \\nencouraging ‘bad’ packing. Amorphous materials may form membranes or thin \\nporous films due to good solubility and processability. Control and tuning of the \\nproperties of amorphous molecular solids might be achieved via functional group \\nmodification of the discrete molecules. The objective of this project was to \\nsynthesize organic cage molecules in an amorphous solid state, and to pack them \\ninefficiently to create permanent porosity.  \\nThis is a brief overview of amorphous molecular solids in the literature. Polymers of \\nintrinsic microporosity (PIMs) were prepared either as insoluble networks or soluble \\npolymers.\\n4\\n The soluble linear PIMs with rigid and contorted molecular structures \\nexhibit high surface areas (700 – 900 m2/g) which can be considered as porous \\nmolecular materials with a range of molecular weights.\\n4\\n Their permanent porosity \\nresults from bad packing of macromolecular chain building blocks. It is noted that \\nPIM-1 with small chains has a lower surface area and the porosity increases with \\nincreasing chain length.\\n5\\n A significant advantage of these materials is their solution \\nprocessability. PIM-1 has been processed into porous thin films or membranes for \\ngas separation. \\n5\\n On the other hand, there are a few examples of amorphous porous \\nmolecular solids comprised of small organic molecules. The Noria molecule shows a \\nAmorphous porous scrambled organic molecular solids \\n134 \\n \\n‘waterwheel’ structure with a large hydrophobic cavity and exhibits gas adsorption \\nproperties in the amorphous state reported by Atwood et al.\\n6\\n It shows a low N2 and \\nH2 uptake with BET surface area of 40 m\\n2\\n/g calculated from the N2 isotherm at 77 K. \\nHowever, it displays a high absorption capacity for CO2. The amorphous Noria \\nmaterial exhibits a type I CO2 isotherm from which the surface area was calculated \\nranging from 280-350 m\\n2\\n/g and a pore volume of 0.13 cm\\n3\\n/g. Noria and its analogue \\nare the first amorphous porous organic molecule to show selective uptake of CO2 \\nover H2 and N2. Furthermore, Atwood and coworkers reported amorphous cucurbit [7] \\nuril material to show one of the highest CO2 sorption capacities among known \\norganic porous materials at 298 K.\\n7\\n Amorphous cucurbit[7]uril (CB[7]) exhibits high \\nthermal stability and permanent porosity from intrinsic voids. The CO2 sorption \\ncapacity is 50 cm\\n3\\n g\\n-1\\n at 1 bar, 297 K. In contrast, the N2 and CH4 uptakes of \\namorphous CB[7] are very low with only 5.5 cm\\n3\\n g\\n-1\\n and 6.0 cm\\n3\\n g\\n-1\\n under the same \\nconditions, respectively. The high selectivity of CO2 over CH4 and N2 can be \\nascribed to the high affinity of CB[7] and CO2. The paper suggested that the material \\nis suitable application for recycling CO2 or SO2 from flue gas stream. Zhang et al. \\nsynthesized a series of amorphous [2+3] cage molecules by a one-pot reversible \\nimine condensation reaction and the imine cages were further reduced to amine.\\n8\\n The \\nmaterials showed a low CO2 and N2 uptake, but high ideal CO2/N2 selectivity in the \\nrange from 36 to 138 at 20 °C and 1 bar. The study indicated that the high selectivity \\nof CO2/N2 is provided not only by the amino group of the cage molecules, also by \\nsize of intrinsic cavities. Mastalerz et al.\\n9\\n reported a procedure to control the \\nmorphology of periphery-substituted cage compounds during the synthesis. A BET \\nsurface areas comparison between bulk amorphous, nanospheric amorphous and bulk \\ncrystalline materials for these cages compounds were included. The amorphous cage \\nmaterials exhibit BET surface areas of approximately 700 m\\n2 \\ng\\n-1\\n. When these cage \\ncompounds are in the crystalline or nanospheric solid state, the surface areas are \\nmuch lower. \\n9\\n \\n \\nAmorphous porous scrambled organic molecular solids \\n135 \\n \\nThis Chapter will describe the synthesis and simulation of amorphous porous \\n‘scrambled’ cages. The dynamic nature of imine bonds provides us novel methods to \\nsynthesize them.\\n10\\n In general, the imine bond can participate in (a) Exchange –the \\nimine bond may undergo dynamic exchange with a second amine. (b) Metathesis – \\ntwo imine bonds can undergo interchange in the solution as Figure 1 illustrated. The \\nsynthesis approaches in this work are based on cage-diamine exchange, cage-cage \\ninterchange and co-reaction of 1, 3, 5-triformylbenzene (TFB) with a mixture of both \\n1, 2-ethylenediamine (EDA) and 1,2-cyclohexanediamine (CHDA), respectively.\\n11\\n \\nCC1 and CC3 were used as templates for exchange reactions. \\n \\n \\nFigure 1.

Cage 1 (CC1) \\nwas synthesized from the condensation reaction of 1,3,5-triformylbenzene with \\n1,2-ethylenediamine and CC1 has a tetrahedral symmetry with six unfunctionalized \\nethylene linkers on the vertices.\\n1\\n A solution of CC1 was placed in solution of (1R, \\n2R)-cyclohexanediamine (CHDA). The vertices of CC1 were replaced by CHDA one \\nby one, and a series of asymmetrical organic cage molecules were produced. The \\ndynamic process can be monitored by NMR and HPLC for characterizing the \\nproducts.  \\n5.2.1 Synthetic procedures  \\nThe dynamic interchange reaction of CC1 with CHDA was performed as follows: \\nCC1 (50 mg, 0.063 mmol) was dissolved in chloroform (5 mL). CHDA (54 mg, 0.47 \\nmmol) was dissolved in CHCl3 (5 mL). The molar ratio of CHDA and CC1 is 7.5 : 1. \\nTherefore a slight excess CHDA was used in order to enable CHDA fully exchange \\nwith six vertices of CC1. The CC1 solution was added directly to the CHDA \\nsolution at room temperature.  \\nThe kinetic NMR study of CC1 and (1R, 2R)-cyclohexanediamine (CHDA) dynamic \\nexchange was carried out as follows: CC1 (5.0 mg, 0.0063 mmol) and CHDA (5.3 \\nmg, 0.047 mmol) were dissolved in CDCl3 (1 mL) in an NMR tube (molar ratio of \\nCHDA: CC1 = 7.5 : 1). The reaction was analyzed for up to 11 days.  \\nThe dynamic interchange reactions of CC1 with CHDA at various reaction ratios \\nwere carried out as follows: CC1 and CHDA were dissolved in CHCl3 (10 mL).The \\namounts were listed in Table 1.  \\n \\n \\nAmorphous porous scrambled organic molecular solids \\n137 \\n \\nTable 1.

The reaction was analyzed for up to 11 days.  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nAmorphous porous scrambled organic molecular solids \\n138 \\n \\n5.2.2 Characterizations of cage-diamine exchange  \\nInitially, the exchange reaction was monitored by \\n1\\nH NMR. The kinetic NMR \\nanalysis of CC1 and excess CHDA dynamic exchange in CDCl3 (1 mL) solution \\n(molar ratio of CC1: CHDA = 1 : 7.5) was carried out for 11 days. The NMR spectra \\nwere recorded every 3 hours for the first 2 days and subsequently every day up to 11 \\ndays. Figure 2(a) illustrates NMR spectra at t = 0, 1 day, 5 days and 11 days, \\nrespectively. The NMR spectrum at t = 0 shows that the chemical shift at 4.02 ppm \\n(labeled by ‘a’ in the spectra) belongs to the protons of EDA- linkers ( ) of \\nthe CC1. The peak for imine protons is observed at 8.18 ppm (labeled by ‘b’). The \\nchemical shift at 7.90 ppm (labeled by ‘c’) is assigned to the aromatic rings of cage \\nmolecules. The peaks in a range from 1.20 ppm to 2.80 ppm belong to protons of \\nCHDA. The integration of EDA- linkers of CC1 at 4.02 ppm decreases over time, \\nwhereas the integration of CHDA –linkers ( ) at 3.33 ppm (labeled by ‘d’) \\nshows a proportional increase. The relative integration of CC1 EDA- linkers and \\nCHDA- linkers from products was plotted according to NMR data in Figure 2(b). It \\ndemonstrates that the exchange reaction occurs immediately after mixing two \\nsolutions of CC1 and CHDA, and the reaction equilibration can be reached within \\n2-3 days at room temperature.  \\n.  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nAmorphous porous scrambled organic molecular solids \\n139 \\n \\n      \\nFigure 2.

HPLC-MS analysis showed that the products consist \\nof a series of cage molecules incorporating both EDA- and CHDA- linked vertices in \\na single cage molecules as Figure 3 shown. The HPLC methodology for cage \\nmolecules was designed by Charlotte Blythe.  \\n \\nFigure 3.

Dynamic exchange reaction of CC1 and CHDA in the solution. The \\nmultifunctional and asymmetrical products could have been formed. \\nIn order to control the distribution of products, the equilibration of the exchange \\nreaction is affected by adjusting the reaction conditions such as reaction ratios and \\ntemperature. The effect of ratios of CC1 and CHDA on the exchange reaction was \\ninvestigated in detail by HPLC and MS. The reaction was maintained at a constant \\ntemperature of 30 °C. The product distribution of the reactions with various CC1 and \\nCHDA ratios is shown in Figure 5. Observed molecular weight in MS data can be \\nassigned to accurate mass for 1\\nn\\n3\\nm\\n cage molecules. As we can see, the equilibrium \\n1\\nn\\n3\\nm\\n product distribution is controlled by the reaction ratio of CC1 and CHDA. The \\nHPLC retention times for CC1 and CC3 are 10 min and 26 min, respectively. Other \\nspecies are observed between CC1 and CC3 in HPLC. The exchange reaction with a \\nratio of CC1 and CHDA at 1:1 gives that a distribution of cage molecules with high \\nvalues of n, such as CC1 (1\\n6\\n3\\n0\\n), 1\\n5\\n3\\n1\\n and 1\\n4\\n3\\n2\\n species. However, high CHDA ratio \\n(CC1 : CHDA = 1 : 6) leads to a predominance of cage molecules with high values \\nof m in the equilibrium 1\\nn\\n3\\nm\\n product distribution with more CC3 (1\\n0\\n3\\n6\\n), 1\\n1\\n3\\n5\\n and \\n1\\n3\\n3\\n3\\n species formed.  \\n+\\n1630 = 1 1036 = 31\\n531 1432 1333 1234 1135\\nAmorphous porous scrambled organic molecular solids \\n142 \\n \\n \\nFigure 5. The product distribution of dynamic exchange reactions with various CC1 \\nand CHDA reaction ratios.  \\nThe exchange reaction also is affected by the reaction temperature to adjust the \\nproduct distribution. The solutions of CC1 and CHDA (molar ratio of CC1: CDHA = \\n1 : 7.5) were mixed in the chloroform solution at a 35 °C and 60 °C, respectively in \\nthe sealed HPLC vials. HPLC was used to follow the kinetic process of exchange \\nreaction and determine the proportion of each cage molecule over the time. The peak \\nareas from HPLC data for each cage molecule are plotted versus time in Figure 6. \\nThe reaction equilibration of the kinetic process occurs after 30 hours at 35 °C and \\nthe peak areas for each species keep constant. In contrast, the reaction is equilibrated \\nafter 8 hours at 60 °C. The peak area of CC1 drops drastically at the beginning of the \\nreaction at both 35°C and 60°C. The peak areas of 1\\n5\\n3\\n1\\n, 1\\n4\\n3\\n1\\n, 1\\n3\\n3\\n3\\n and CC3 cage \\nspecies were observed to increase at the beginning of the reaction and then decrease \\nuntil they maintain a constant.

The distribution of molecular species analyzed by HPLC for the exchange \\nreaction at different temperature. \\nWe also investigated the dynamic exchange reaction of CC3 with EDA to produce \\nCC1 and other cage molecule species. The reaction of CC3 with excess 1, \\nAmorphous porous scrambled organic molecular solids \\n144 \\n \\n2-ethylenediamine (EDA) in CDCl3 solution (1 mL) was also followed by NMR for \\n11 days. The molar ratio of CC3 and EDA is 1 : 7.5. The protons for CHDA- linkers \\non the CC3 vertices were observed at 3.33 ppm (labeled by ‘a’ in the spectra) in \\nFigure 7. There is no significant change of the integration of CHDA-linkers of CC3 \\nover the reaction time. The two peaks for the EDA- linkers of CC1 were observed at \\n3.87 and 4.20 ppm after 5 days which ascribed to the scrambling of cages (labeled by \\n‘b’ in the spectra). The small amount of scrambled cages was formed after 11 days \\ndynamic exchange reaction. The results indicate that the exchange process of CC3 \\nand EDA occurs slowly. \\n \\nFigure 7.

The \\ntrend in Figure 6 rationalizes the dynamic exchange of CC1 and CHDA to form a \\nseries of scrambled cage molecules.

The reaction of CC1 with CC3 was observed to be a \\nslowly interchange in solution at 30 ˚C to form a comparable 1n3m product \\ndistribution. The study was carried out by Dr James T. A. Jones and Dr Tom Hasell. \\nThe cage mixed products were analyzed by the kinetic HPLC.  \\n5.3.1 Synthetic procedure \\n100 mg CC3 and 100 mg CC1 were dissolved in 10 ml chloroform separately. The \\nreaction was carried out in an HPLC autosampler for ease of sampling and the two \\nsolutions were kept separate until the start of the HPLC analysis. The solutions were \\nmixed immediately before analysis in a proportion which achieved a 1:1 molar ratio \\nof CC1: CC3 (10 mL of CC3 solution + 7.1 mL of CC1 solution).  \\n5.3.2 Characterizations of cage-cage interchange \\nHPLC chromatograms were then measured every hour for the first 48 hours and \\nsubsequently every 3 hours up to a total reaction time of 300 hours. The reaction was \\nmaintained at a constant temperature of 30 °C. The kinetic process of cage and cage \\ninterchange is shown in Figure 9. The peak areas of CC1 and CC3 from HPLC data \\ndrop dramatically when mixing two solutions. The proportions of 1\\n5\\n3\\n1\\n and 1\\n1\\n3\\n5\\n \\nspecies vary as a function of time, first increasing and the decreasing. The \\npopulations of 1\\n4\\n3\\n2\\n, 1\\n3\\n3\\n3\\nand 1\\n1\\n3\\n5\\n species increase over time and keep constant when \\nthe reaction is equilibrated. The cage mixed products were obtained at the end of the \\nreaction for NMR, PXRD, and gas sorption analysis. \\nAmorphous porous scrambled organic molecular solids \\n147 \\n \\n \\nFigure 9. CC1 and CC3 interchange. Product distribution was analyzed by HPLC.  \\nThe scrambled cage molecules formed by cage-cage interchange are characterized by \\n1\\nH NMR. Figure 10 shows NMR spectra for CC1, CC3 and scrambled cages, \\nrespectively. The imine protons of scrambled cages are at 8.18 ppm which is similar \\nto CC1 and CC3. The chemical shift at 7.90 ppm is assigned to aromatic rings of \\nscrambled cages. These peaks are multiple and board compared with the ones for \\nCC1 and CC3 due to asymmetrical symmetry of scrambled cages. The multiple \\npeaks in a range from 1.20 ppm to 1.90 ppm are consistent with protons of \\ncyclohexyl groups, ‘a’ and ‘b’ on the vertices ( ). The peak at 3.33 ppm was \\nassigned to the protons on the cage CHDA-linked vertices, ‘c’. The scrambling of the \\ncages is confirmed by the splitting of the peak arising from CC1 ( ) at 4.02 \\nppm into two peaks at 3.87 and 4.14 ppm.  \\nThe cage-cage interchange reaction has a practical advantage over the cage-diamine \\n+\\nEquilibrate\\na\\nb\\n- H2O\\n1630 10361531 1432 1333 1234 1135\\nAmorphous porous scrambled organic molecular solids \\n148 \\n \\nmethod because there is no excess diamine to separate from the resulting product \\nmixture at the end of the reaction.

The co-reaction of TFB with \\nEDA and CHDA was carried out with various EDA: CHDA ratios to produce the \\nresulting product mixture. The products is shown in Figure 12 which is identical to \\nthe ones produced by cage-cage and cage-diamine dynamic exchange. \\n \\nFigure 12. Direct co-reaction of two different diamines to form amorphous porous \\norganic cages.  \\n5.4.1 Synthetic procedure  \\nGeneral synthetic procedure is described as followed. Dichloromethane (25 mL) was \\nslowly added to TFB (100 mg, 0.62 mmol) in a sample vial at room temperature. \\nUnder these conditions, the TFB did not dissolve immediately. A solution of EDA in \\nDCM (5 mL) and a solution of CHDA in DCM (5 mL) were added respectively. \\nSamples A-E were produced by the co-reaction of EDA and CHDA with TFB at \\nAmorphous porous scrambled organic molecular solids \\n150 \\n \\nvarious molar ratios of EDA: CHDA. The amounts are listed in Table 2. After 5 days, \\na clear homogeneous solution was observed with no undissolved material being \\npresent. The products were obtained by solvent rotary evaporation and were white \\npowders. The crude products were filtered, washed with ethyl acetate to remove any \\nunreacted starting materials. The product was air dried overnight before analysis. \\nTypical yield after washing = 55–60 %. \\nTable 2.

HPLC demonstrated that the \\nequilibrium 1\\nn\\n3\\nm\\n product distribution was controlled by the diamine ratio shown in \\nFigure 13. There is a direct correlation between the reaction ratio and the products \\ndistribution in this series of samples. High EDA ratios in the reagent mixture result in \\npredominance of cage products with high value of n. For example, the products \\ndistribution of sample A-B was dominated by CC1, 1\\n5\\n3\\n1\\n, and 1\\n4\\n3\\n2\\n species. High \\nAmorphous porous scrambled organic molecular solids \\n151 \\n \\nCHDA ratios in the reagent mixture lead to cage molecules mixture incorporating \\nmore CHDA-linked vertices such as 1\\n2\\n3\\n4\\n, and 1\\n1\\n3\\n5\\n and CC3.

All gas sorption isotherms were measured by Dr \\nJames T. A. Jones and Dr Tom Hasell. The materials were heated to 100 ˚C under \\ndynamic vacuum for 12 hours to fully desolvate and degas the samples before gas \\nsorption analysis. N2 sorption measurements at 77 K show Type I isotherms for all \\nsamples (A-F). The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface areas are obtained from \\nN2 sorption isotherms at 77 K. The surface areas for samples C-E are 522, 623 and 704 \\nm\\n2 \\ng\\n-1\\n, respectively. The BET method is applied in the relative pressure range of \\n0.01-0.10 to calculate surface areas. Samples A-B do not demonstrate permanent \\nporosity to N2. Likewise, the sample F by cage-cage interchange shows a surface area \\nof 818 m\\n2\\ng\\n-1\\n which has exceeded comparable amorphous molecular solids.\\n6-8, 17\\n Total \\nN2 uptakes for sample C-F are 7.52, 9.21, 10.7 and 11.0 mmol g\\n-1\\n at 1 bar and 77.3 K, \\nrespectively.  \\n \\nAmorphous porous scrambled organic molecular solids \\n159 \\n \\n \\nFigure 19.

They adsorb amounts of CO2 in the range 1.60 -1.93 mmol g\\n-1\\n \\n(7.0-8.7 wt. %) at 293 K ant 1.2 bar. The CO2 uptake for sample F at 273 K and 1.2 \\nbar is 2.84 mmol g\\n-1\\n. The materials are able to adsorb a large amount of H2, 3.70 – \\n6.07 mmol g\\n-1\\n for sample A-F at 77 K and 1.2 bar. The H2 uptakes for sample A and \\nB was 4.81 and 3.71 mmol g\\n-1\\n, respectively, although they had a very low N2 uptake. \\nTherefore, H2/N2 gas selectivity was observed for sample A-B.

Sample D showed type I gas \\nsorption isotherm and SABET = 623 m\\n2\\n g\\n-1\\n (see Figure 19 above). Sample D (80 mg) \\nwas dissolved in chloroform (5 mL). The filter paper (93.2 mg) was immersed in \\nsample D solution. The filter paper was obtained from the Fisher Scientific with \\nparticle retention > 20 μm. After 3 days, the filter paper was vacuumed dried \\novernight before analysis. The weight of filter paper after doping with amorphous \\nscrambled cage solids was 103.8 mg. The weight increased by 11.4 %. Before doping, \\nSABET of pure filter paper was 3 m\\n2\\n g\\n-1\\n. After doping with amorphous scrambling \\ncage solids, filter paper showed type I gas sorption isotherm and SABET of filter paper \\nis 161 m\\n2\\n g\\n-1\\n compared to 623 m\\n2\\n g\\n-1\\n for sample D on its own. The gas sorption \\nisotherms for filter paper before and after doping were shown in Figure 26. The filter \\npaper becomes porous after doping with amorphous cages. \\n \\nFigure 26.

As observed by SEM, amorphous cage materials were \\nlocalized between fibers. The preliminary results show that the molecular pores can \\nbe imbibed into the filter paper, in order to introduce a degree of microporosity. \\n \\nFigure 27.

Two separated \\npeaks for each of 1\\n2\\n3\\n4\\n, 1\\n3\\n3\\n3\\n and 1\\n4\\n3\\n2\\n species were observed which suggested that the \\npossible isomeric forms exist for each species. The HPLC trace shows splitting of \\npeaks for the species 1\\n4\\n3\\n2\\n, 1\\n3\\n3\\n3\\n and 1\\n2\\n3\\n4\\n which can be ascribed to cis/trans (1\\n4\\n3\\n2\\n and \\n1\\n2\\n3\\n4\\n) and mer/fac (1\\n3\\n3\\n3\\n) isomers. HPLC-MS and MALDI-TOF experiments confirm \\nthe molecular mass of these species but it was not possible to assign peaks to specific \\nisomers. \\n \\nFigure 28. HPLC distribution of cage products produced by dynamic exchange \\nreaction between CC1 and CHDA.  \\nThese asymmetrical cage molecules could be isolated by preparative HPLC scale as \\nshown in Figure 29 for each cage molecule. The isolation of the asymmetrical cages \\nwas done by a company, Peakdale Molecular. These cage molecules were purified by \\nHPLC using Hypersil GOLD phenyl, 150 x 4.6 mm, 5 μm linked to Hypersil GOLD \\n150 x 4.6 mm, 5 μm columns.

A model for the co-reaction of EDA and \\nCHDA at a reaction ratio of 2: 4 (sample D) was constructed using Accelrys \\nMaterials Studio 5.0. The model was built in two steps. Firstly, a periodic simulation \\ncell was constructed containing 33 cage molecules chosen to represent the numerical \\ndistribution of species observed by HPLC for sample D. The 33 cage molecules (1   \\n1\\n5\\n3\\n1\\n, 5   1432, 9   1333, 12   1234, 5   1135 and 1   1036) were treated as rigid \\nbodies and loaded into an amorphous cell at a low density of 0.3 g cm\\n-3\\n using the \\nUniversal Forcefield (UFF).\\n19\\n The initial model was then geometry optimized under \\nexternal pressure using the Forcite module and the COMPASS force field \\n20\\n. The \\nexternal pressure was continually ramped up until the simulation density matched the \\n‘target’ density. Finally the model was then totally relaxed using the geometry \\noptimization and the simulation density remained close to the experimental ‘target’ \\ndensity. The target bulk density for the model is 0.716 g cm\\n-3\\n which can be gained \\nfrom the equation Wo = 1/    -1/   .\\n21\\n Wo is the micropore volume (0.212 cm\\n3 \\ng\\n-1\\n \\nfor sample D), the absolute density,    , was measured by helium pycnometry, 0.844 \\ng cm\\n-3\\n. Therefore, the bulk density was calculated to be 0.716 g cm\\n-3\\n. The simulated \\nbulk density for the model was 0.766 g cm\\n-3\\n, which is close to the measured \\nexperimental ‘target’ density. A solvent accessible surface area of 577 m2 g-1 was \\ncalculated using a probe radius of N2, 1.82 Å, compared with experimental surface \\narea, SABET, for sample D of 623 m\\n2\\ng\\n-1\\n. Interconnected pore channels were identified \\nin the model in terms of the inherent pores in the cage molecules, and the ineffective \\npacking that results from the distribution of molecular shapes. The Connolly solvent \\nvolume is fully connected and shown in Figure 32(b). In addition, the contribution of \\nextrinsic pore volume was estimated from this atomistic model, although it is \\ndifficult to probe it experimentally. In the model of sample D, 80 % of the total free \\nvolume in the simulation cells arises from the voids of inefficient packing, compared \\nwith 20 % calculated for the internal cage volume. However, in the crystalline CC3, \\nAmorphous porous scrambled organic molecular solids \\n174 \\n \\n37.6 % of the pore volume can be attributed to voids between cages and 63.4 % to \\nthe internal cage voids. As a result, the porosity in amorphous scrambled cages \\n(sample D) results predominantly from the large increase inefficient packing. We \\nsuggest that the molecular packing in the amorphous scramble cage has analogies \\nwith computer game ‘Tetris’ showed in Figure 32(c).  \\n \\n \\nFigure 32. (a) Atomistic simulation for amorphous sample D (EDA:CHDA = 2:4). \\nAn amorphous cell was constructed containing 33 cage molecules (1 × 1\\n5\\n3\\n1\\n, 5 × 1\\n4\\n3\\n2\\n, \\n9 × 1\\n3\\n3\\n3\\n, 12 × 1\\n2\\n3\\n4\\n, 5 × 1\\n1\\n3\\n5\\n, 1 × 1\\n0\\n3\\n6\\n) chosen to represent the molecular distribution \\nas calculated from HPLC peak areas. The Connolly surface (b) is also shown using a \\nprobe radius of 1.82 Å. (c) The molecular packing in this system has analogies with \\ncomputer games such as ‘Tetris’. \\nSimulation of N2 sorption in amorphous sample D was carried out using Materials \\nStudio 5.0 Sorption locator module in order to identify N2 sorption location.

They are based on cage-diamine exchange, \\ncage-cage interchange, and direct co-reaction of TFB with a mixture of both EDA \\nand CHDA, respectively. The cage molecules were observed to incorporate both \\nEDA- and CHDA- linked vertices in a single cage molecule. A distribution of \\nmolecule species packs together ineffectively, and creates permanent porosity in the \\namorphous solid. The gas sorption properties in samples A-E can be controlled as a \\nfunction of EDA : CHDA reaction ratio, and H2/N2 gas selectivity behavior can be \\ntuned. The amorphous cage materials with a high EDA ratio can adsorb much more \\nH2 than N2. However, the materials with a low EDA ratio are highly porous to both \\nH2 and N2. The BET surface area of one of these amorphous scrambled cage \\nmaterials is up to 818 m\\n2\\n g\\n-1\\n which has exceeded crystalline porous cage molecules \\nand other porous amorphous molecules. A simulation model is built to rationalize the \\nporosity of amorphous cage molecules. Molecular simulations suggest that the \\nenhanced porosity in these amorphous scrambled solids result predominantly from \\nextrinsic porosity inter cage voids. The asymmetrical cage molecules have been \\nisolated and performed for gas sorption analysis. N2 uptakes for these materials are \\nas a function of cage vertex functionality. Amorphous CC3 with six bulky and \\ncyclohexyl vertices exhibits a high N2 uptake. However, the porosity of asymmetrical \\ncage molecules decreases with less cyclohexyl groups. Amorphous CC1 without \\ncyclohexyl vertices is non-porous to N2. The preliminary results show that the \\namorphous cage molecules can be doped into the filter paper to introduce a degree of \\nmicroporosity.  \\nThe future work could focus on enhancing porosity by introducing more bulky \\nfunctionality of cage vertices, such biphenyl or naphthyl groups. It would also be \\ninteresting to combine different molecule topologies ([2+3], [4+6] or [8+12] cage) in \\na single amorphous solid. Molecular simulations could be used to rationalize gas \\nselectivity in these amorphous scrambled systems. \\nAmorphous porous scrambled organic molecular solids \\n177 \\n \\n5.11 Chapter acknowledgements \\nIn this chapter, I would like to thank Andy, Dave and Abbie for their supervision and \\nsuggestions on my work.

BET surface areas up to 898 m\\n2\\n g\\n-1\\n exceed \\ncomparable amorphous molecular solids. The gas sorption properties were tuned by \\nvarying the cage vertex functionality. H2/N2 gas selectivity was observed as a \\nfunction of the 1, 2-diaminoethylene (EDA): 1,2-diaminocyclohexane (CHDA) ratio \\non cage vertex in these amorphous cage materials. Amorphous CC1, with fully EDA \\nvertices, displayed a selectively porous to H2 and gives a H2/N2 selectivity of 12 at \\n77 K, 1 bar.  Amorphous cage materials with high EDA ratios can adsorb much \\nmore H2 than N2. For example, materials from scrambling reactions with a ratio of \\nEDA and CHDA to be 5: 1 exhibited a H2/N2 selectivity of 5. However, amorphous \\nmaterials with low EDA ratios showed non-selectively porous to both N2 and H2, \\nsuch as amorphous CC3 with fully CHDA vertices. We suggested that the enhanced \\nporosity in these amorphous scrambled solids results predominantly from the \\nextrinsic inter-cage void volume according to molecular simulations.\\n1a\\n Although \\nexperimental approaches such as measuring the adsorption isotherms can be used to \\ncharacterize the properties of porous materials in the macroscopic scope, there is also \\na need for a more fundamental molecular-level understanding of materials. An \\nalternative approach for characterizing these amorphous molecular systems is based \\non molecular simulations.\\n2\\n The pore structure and connectivity of crystalline \\nmicoporous materials are well understood, and pore size and shape are therefore \\nmore designable for applications because the crystal structures are available from \\nsingle crystal XRD data.\\n3\\n However, amorphous materials have no long-range order, \\nSimulation of gas diffusion in amorphous porous organic cages \\n182 \\n \\nmeaning that the experimental characterization of amorphous porous materials is \\nmainly achieved from surface areas, pore volumes and pore size distributions. \\nIn order to simulate the properties and performance of amorphous porous materials, a \\nrepresentative structural model must be generated. However, the generation of a \\nrealistic model for amorphous materials is a challenging task. There are two common \\napproaches to produce representative polymer structures.\\n4\\n One is packing polymer \\nchains at the experimental density, either by using geometry energy minimisation or \\nby using Monte Carlo chain growth techniques. Another method is to generate \\npolymer structures at low densities and then follow several steps of compression and \\nrelaxation with MD simulations until a target experimental density is achieved.\\n4\\n \\nHowever, some drawbacks exist for both methods. First, the simulations rely on an \\nexperimental target density. The schemes make the density of the model as close to the \\nexperiment density, in some cases, which can lead to poor estimations of the physical \\nproperties.\\n4c, 5\\n Also, some procedures cannot build a realistic structure due to atomic \\noverlaps of large, rigid repeat units.\\n6\\n Several computational studies have generated \\namorphous porous organic polymers structures, such as polymers of intrinsic \\nmicroporosity (PIMs)\\n7\\n, hyper-cross-linked polymers (HCPs)\\n8\\n and conjugated \\nmicroporous polymers (CMPs).\\n9\\n We have presented a method for the construction of \\nHCPs via clusters that are grown using an in-house code with a Monte Carlo \\napproach.\\n10\\n A range of different cluster sizes is generated during the growth of \\nmonomers and then packed into amorphous cells. Recently, Colina and co-workers \\nreported a simulation scheme for generating HCPs models that followed the synthesis \\nroute of simultaneous growth of chains and cross-linkers.\\n11\\n The cross-linking and \\npolymerization were performed by linking closer repeat units together. The final step \\nof structure generation was followed by a 21-step compression and slow \\ndecompression protocol which results in experimental-like densities. The same \\napproach has been applied to generate PIM models by Colina and co-workers.\\n12\\n \\nIn this Chapter, the methodology for generating organic cage molecules packed into \\nthe amorphous solid state is described. Following on from the structure generation, \\nSimulation of gas diffusion in amorphous porous organic cages \\n183 \\n \\nwe will simulate gas diffusion in these amorphous porous materials to rationalize gas \\nselectivity. Typically, the diffusion in porous materials is affected by a variety of \\nfactors, such as the shape and size of the pores and the guest molecules, as well as \\nthe interaction between the guest molecules and pore surfaces.\\n3a, 13\\n The \\ninterconnectivity of the pore structure contributes to the overall diffusion and \\ntransport properties. A better understanding of this phenomenon will aid the \\noptimization and development of industrial applications of these materials in \\nseparation and catalytic processes.  \\nThe reliable computational prediction of diffusion properties of guest molecules in \\namorphous organic cages will be a valuable tool in designing appropriate materials in \\nfuture. There are only a few reports simulating gas diffusion in porous organic \\nmolecules using MD simulations. All of them are based on crystalline porous organic \\nmolecules. Alavi et al. \\n14\\n has studied p-tert-butylcalix[4]arene inclusion small guest \\nmolecules using molecular simulations. The generic AMBER force field was used \\nfor MD simulations and the calixarene molecules were kept rigid. The unit cell \\nvolume, density and inclusion energy were determined. Ripmeester and co-workers \\n15\\n reported an experimental and molecular simulation study on hydrogen adsorption \\nand diffusion in p-tert-butylcalix[4]arene. Rawashdeh and co-workers \\n16\\n indicated \\nthe inclusion complexation of methyl viologen with cucurbit[n]uril using MD \\nsimulation. The energy barriers for the host and guest inclusion process were \\nobtained from the potential of mean force (PMF). A number of studies have \\ndetermined the diffusivities of gases in amorphous polymers.\\n17\\n In some cases, there \\nis a discrepancy between theoretical and experimental results.\\n18\\n A hopping \\nmechanism has been suggested for gas diffusion in amorphous polymers.\\n19\\n The gas \\nmolecule resides in the pore cavity, and from time to time, jumps to the adjacent \\ncavity because of interconnection of pore cavities. We have observed that H2 \\nmolecules can hop from one cavity to another cavity from MD simulation in \\ncrystalline CC1β, a polymorph of crystalline CC1.20  \\nSimulation of gas diffusion in amorphous porous organic cages \\n184 \\n \\nIn this Chapter, the structures and gas diffusion properties of amorphous CC1 and \\nCC3 materials are analysed with use of MD simulations. Experimental observations \\nshow that amorphous CC1 is selectively porous to H2 than N2 and amorphous CC3 is \\nporous to both H2 and N2. Amorphous CC3 also demonstrates a higher porosity. This \\nChapter describes the design of a methodology for packing porous organic cages in \\nthe amorphous solid state and study a dynamic diffusion of guest molecules (mainly \\nH2, N2) through cavities or pores of amorphous organic cages.

The samples were degassed offline at 100 °C for 15 h under \\ndynamic vacuum before analysis. The amorphous CC1 demonstrated a low N2 \\nuptake at 77 K, 1 bar. Therefore, amorphous CC1 was considered to be non-porous \\nto N2. In contrast, H2 sorption of amorphous CC1 showed an uptake of 3.1 mmol g\\n-1\\n \\nshown in Figure 1. This adsorption behaviour suggested that amorphous CC1 might \\nbe a good candidate for gas separation. The ideal selectivity was calculated from \\nthese isotherms to be 12 for H2/N2 at 77 K, 1 bar.  \\nSimulation of gas diffusion in amorphous porous organic cages \\n186 \\n \\n \\nFigure 1.

A Cage Specific Force Field (CSFF) was used in this work which \\nwas developed by Daniel Holden.\\n21\\n CSFF was parameterized based on PCFF \\n22\\n and \\nfitted for cage molecules. The force field (FF) parameters for the intra-molecular \\nbonds, angles and dihedral potentials for the cage fragment were fitted using Density \\nFunctional Theory (DFT) with a B3LYP functional and 6-31G (b,p) basis set.\\n23\\n The \\nenergy curves from DFT have a good agreement with FF optimized energy plots. \\nLennard-Jones (LJ) 9-6 potentials were used to describe the non-bonding interactions \\nbetween cages. The atomic charges were obtained from force field parameters. It has \\nbeen shown that the CSFF minimized structures for crystalline cage 1, cage 2 and \\ncage 3 compare well to the structures obtained from single crystal XRD. All MD \\nsimulations in this work are undertaken using the DL_POLY2.20 \\n24\\n with Verlet \\nleapfrog algorithm \\n25\\n for integrating the equations of motion of interaction and \\ntrajectories.  \\nIn order to obtain reliable physical properties of amorphous materials, an important \\nconsideration is to generate realistic structural models for molecular simulations. \\nThe approach described here for generating models of amorphous porous cages is \\nimplemented in the following steps: (1) Generate an initial configuration which is \\ncomposed of 40 cages placed randomly in the cubic simulation cell at a low density; \\n(2) An MD simulation of 500 ps using a NVE ensemble to stabilize the initial \\nconfiguration; (3) An MD simulation of 8 ns using a NPT ensemble to fully \\nequilibrate and compress the system; (4) Force field geometry optimization for the \\nfinal configuration. The simulation procedure is shown in Scheme 1 and explained in \\nthe following: \\n \\n \\nSimulation of gas diffusion in amorphous porous organic cages \\n191 \\n \\n \\nScheme 1. Simulation procedure for generation of amorphous cage structures \\n(1) The single cage molecules (cage 1 and cage 3, respectively) as repeated units in \\nthe cell are taken from the single crystal X-ray structures (obtained from the \\nCambridge crystallographic database with reference number CCDC 720848 for cage \\n1 and CCDC 720850 for cage 3). Cage 1 (CC1) has unhindered ethylene vertices and \\nCage 3 (CC3) has bulky cyclohexane vertices. Both of molecules exhibit structural \\nchirality. The homochiral (R,R)-1,2-diaminoethylene cage 1, CC1-R and \\n(R,R)-1,2-diaminocyclohexane cage 3, CC3-R were used for the simulations.  The \\nmodels for amorphous cages were built using the Amorphous Cell module in the \\nMaterials Studio Modelling 5.0 software package (Accelrys). All cage molecules \\nwere treated as rigid bodies and the amorphous cell was loaded with cage molecules \\nat a low density of 0.1-0.25 g cm\\n-3\\n using the Universal Forcefield (UFF).\\n26\\n Six \\ndifferent initial configurations were generated for each amorphous system for a \\nsampling purpose. Each model consists of 40 cage molecules. The simulation cell \\ncontains either 4320 atoms for amorphous CC1 or 6720 atoms for amorphous CC3.  \\n(2) An MD run using a NVE ensemble for 500 ps was used to stabilize the low \\ndensity structure obtained in step 1. The simulation was performed with the \\nNose-Hoover thermostat and barostat \\n27\\n at 300 K, a pressure of 1 atm and the \\nthermostat and barostat relaxation times of 0.5 ps. The total production time was 500 \\nps with a 50 ps equilibration time and a time step of 0.5 fs.  \\nA short NVE ensemble simulation stabilizes the initial configuration, whereas a \\ndirect NPT ensemble MD simulation for an unstable configuration might lead to a \\nfailure of the program due to violating basic assumptions in the code. As shown in \\nSimulation of gas diffusion in amorphous porous organic cages \\n192 \\n \\nthe Figure 6, the configuration energy drops rapidly and maintains a constant \\naverage for the 500 ps NVE simulation. The temperature /pressure fluctuations can \\nbe used to improve the energy conservation.

In general, for the simulation of amorphous \\nmaterials, a large simulation cell is required and different models should be \\nconstructed and their properties are averaged in order to better represent bulk \\nmaterials. However, there is a trade-off between simulation time and statistical \\nnumbers of models.  In this work, for each of amorphous CC1 and amorphous CC3, \\nsix different independent samples were constructed following the procedure outlined \\npreviously (labelled as Model 1-Model 6). In order to ensure that the simulation \\nmodels are representative of experimental bulk materials, the structual models \\n(Model 1-Model 6) were then characterizated in terms of surface areas and pore \\nvolumes which can then be compared to experimental data (AC1 – AC6).  \\nIn the case of amorphous CC3, the surface area and pore volume of the six \\nindependent simulation models generated using the procedure outlined previously are \\ngiven in Table 1 and are compared with the experimental BET surface area, \\nLangmuir surface area and t-plot microporous volume in Table 2. In Table 1, the \\nrange of density for the final configurations is from 0.76 to 0.89 g/cm\\n3\\n. The average \\ndensity over six simulation samples is 0.82 g/cm\\n3\\n with a standard deviation of 0.05 \\ng/cm\\n3\\n. The solvent accessible surface areas (SASA) were generated using a N2 probe \\nradius of 1.82 Å for all of the final configurations. The average SASA is 744 m\\n2\\n/g \\ncompared with average BET surface areas of 860 m\\n2\\n/g over six experimental \\nsamples. The simulated pore volumes are determined from an average of Connolly \\npore volume and solvent accessible pore volume.\\n28\\n The average simulated pore \\nvolume is 0.25 cm\\n3\\n/g compared with the experimental micropore volume of 0.29 \\ncm\\n3\\n/g. As can be seen, the standard deviation of simulated SASA or pore volume \\nover six models is relatively high. This might be due to the feature of inherently \\nnonequilibrium structures of amorphous materials. In other words, each individual \\nsample for amorphous materials produced either in the experiment or simulation has \\na different equilibrium state which can lead to a different physical properties. To \\nSimulation of gas diffusion in amorphous porous organic cages \\n198 \\n \\nconclude, simulated data presented above have a reasonable agreement with \\nexperimental data. \\nTable 1.

CC1 was \\nsynthesized from the condensation reaction of 1, 3, 5-triformylbenzene with \\n1,2-ethylenediamine and CC3 from 1, 2- diaminocyclohexane. CC1 has six \\nunhindered ethylene linkers on the vertices resulting in the cages being able to pack \\nmuch closer. Disconnected Connolly volumes were observed using a probe radius of \\n1.82 Å. CC3 has more bulky and rigid cyclohexyl groups which direct the cages to \\nwindow to window packing in the crystal structure. Consequently, crystalline CC3 \\nhas an interconnected 3- dimensional diamondoid pore channels.  \\n \\nFigure 9.  a ,d ) Isolated CC1 and CC3 molecule (hydrogen atoms are omitted for \\nclarity.

Amorphous cage models have a larger unit cell than crystalline cage \\nstructures. The average unit cell over six models of amorphous CC1 is 39.0 Å x 39.0 \\na b c\\nd e f\\nSimulation of gas diffusion in amorphous porous organic cages \\n202 \\n \\nÅ x 39.0 Å containing 4320 atoms compared with the unit cell of crystalline CC1: a \\n= 12.8 Å, b = 10.9 Å c = 36.8 Å. The average unit cell over six models of amorphous \\nCC3 is 45.6 Å x 45.6 Å x 45.6 Å with 6720 atoms in a comparison to 24.8 Å x 24.8 \\nÅ x 24.8 Å for the crystalline CC3 unit cell. In Figure 10 (a) and 11 (a), solvent \\naccessible surface areas of six models of amorphous CC3 and CC1 respectively, are \\nshown using a probe radius of N2 (1.82 Å). The void structure available to N2 in \\namorphous CC3 is fully connected leading to a porous network. The porosity of \\namorphous CC3 arises from both intrinsic intra cage voids and extrinsic inter cage \\nvoids. By contrast, amorphous CC1 has isolated voids which are lack of connectivity \\nas illustrated by the solvent accessible surface area. Therefore, amorphous CC1 is \\nnon-porous to N2 based on the static structure.  \\nThe solvent accessible surfaces calculated using a H2 radius of 1.42 Å for amorphous \\nCC3 and CC1 are displayed in Figure 10 (b) and Figure 11 (b). The H2 accessible \\nvolume is partially interconnected in amorphous CC1 and fully connected in \\namorphous CC3. As shown in Figure 10 (b), a large extrinsic pore cavity in \\namorphous CC3 is observed which is also connected with adjacent cages. The \\nanalysis of the static structure indicates that the gas molecule of H2 is capable of \\ndiffusing through the amorphous CC1 and CC3. In principle, the analysis of pore \\nconnectivity based on the static structure suggests that amorphous CC1 will be \\nporous to H2 but not to N2 and amorphous CC3 is porous to both H2 and N2. These \\nobservations are consistent with experimental results. However, analysing the surface \\nof static structures only does not give reliable information on the connectivity of \\npores or the diffusion mechanism. In order to gain these understandings, we use \\nmolecular dynamic simulations to investigate gas diffusion in amorphous cage \\nsystems. \\n \\nSimulation of gas diffusion in amorphous porous organic cages \\n203 \\n \\n \\n \\nFigure 10.

The Verlet leapfrog algorithm was used to \\nintegrate Newton equations. All the Lennard-Jones interactions were calculated with \\na cut off of 10 Å and the long range coulomb interactions were calculated by the \\nEwald summation method. The time step used in this work was 0.5 fs and periodic \\nboundary conditions were used. The simulations were carried out at 300 K, and a \\npressure of 1 atm. A total production time of 10 ns (4 x10\\n7\\n steps) was used with an \\nequilibration time of 50 ps (1 x 10\\n5\\n steps). The trajectory was generated at every 200 \\nsteps which is equal to every 0.1 ps sampling for subsequent analysis of the diffusion \\nmechanism. The time interval for sampling the trajectory is small enough to track of \\nthe H2 and N2 diffusion. A smaller sampling time would lead to extremely large \\noutput files.  \\nWe are studying H2 and N2 gas molecules which are both described as linear rigid \\nmolecules. The potential parameters of H2 molecule are obtained from CSFF force \\nfield without charge consideration. The N2 molecule is treated as the ‘Bean’ model \\nwhich has been suggested by Potoff and Siepmann.\\n30\\n In this model, the nitrogen \\natoms of the N2 molecule have their own repulsion /dispersion interactions \\n(Lennard-Jones) and their own distinct partial charge with q= -0.482. To compensate \\nfor these partial negative charges, the centre of mass of nitrogen molecule is given a \\ncharge with q=+0.964. The N-N bond distance is set as 1.1 Å according to the \\nexperimental data.  \\nThe amorphous cage models are obtained from the structure generation procedure \\noutlined above. Initially, some simulations were carried out to check the effect of \\ndifferent amorphous models on gas diffusion, as the porous physical properties were \\nobserved to vary in different amorphous models as shown in Table 1 and Table 3. \\nThree amorphous CC3 models were chosen. The simulation density was 0.78 \\nSimulation of gas diffusion in amorphous porous organic cages \\n206 \\n \\n(CC3-1), 0.77 (CC3-2) and 0.73 g/cm\\n3\\n (CC3-3) and the solvent accessible surface \\nareas were 737, 751 and 1058 m\\n2\\n/g respectively. N2 diffusion in these three models \\nwas simulated during a 3 ns NPT simulation at 300 K. Three different amorphous \\nCC3 models showed that N2 molecule diffusion through a broad area, as illustrated \\nin Figure 12 (a). The simulation density of the three amorphous CC1 models chosen \\nwas 0.88 (CC1-1), 0.86 (CC1-2) and 0.87 (CC1-3) g/cm\\n3\\n respectively. N2 diffusion \\nwas restricted to a limited zone for the three different models as shown in Figure 12 \\n(b). In term of the diffusion trajectories, gas diffusion behaviour did not have a \\nsignificant difference in different amorphous models.  \\nTherefore, one of the amorphous CC1 and CC3 models is chosen for a further \\nanalysis. The simulated density of amorphous CC1 model is 0.88 g/cm\\n3\\n with solvent \\naccessible surface area of 240 m\\n2\\n/g (Model 1 in Table 3) and the simulated density of \\namorphous CC3 model is 0.78 g/cm\\n3\\n with solvent accessible surface area of 737 \\nm\\n2\\n/g (Model 3 in Table 1). The structural properties of these models have a \\nreasonable agreement with experimental data of amorphous CC1 and CC3. The cage \\nmolecules are treated as flexible during MD simulations.

To do this, we analysed the position of the N2 and H2 during the MD \\nsimulations. \\nThe MD output data was analysed with an in-house script written in PERL. All of \\nthe PERL scripts used in this work were written by Dr Kim Jelfs. The script takes \\nthe HISOTRY file from MD and calculates position of the cage centre of mass for \\neach of the forty cages; thereby it is able to identify the positions of gas molecule \\nrelative to the cage centre. The following information was provided: \\n \\nCC3-1 CC3-2 CC3-3\\nCC1-1 CC1-2 CC1-3\\na \\nb \\nSimulation of gas diffusion in amorphous porous organic cages \\n208 \\n \\n1. The location of the gas molecule at each sampled step and describing it as inside \\ncage, outside all cages or a cage window. Everything less than 3.5 Å from the \\ncage centre of mass is defined as inside cage. Between 3.5 and 4.5 from the \\ncentre of mass is in cage window. The rest is outside of the cage which can be \\nthought of as in the extrinsic pore volume. \\nMolecular simulations of a H2 or N2 placed randomly in amorphous CC1 and \\nCC3 were run for 10 ns using the NPT ensemble for gas location analysis. \\nFigure 13 shows the analysis of the gas molecule location for a 3 ns time period \\nof the full MD simulation. Frequent hopping is observed for both H2 and N2 for \\namorphous CC1. However, this can be attributed to the movement of a gas \\nmolecule from the cage window and then back to its original cage cavity. This \\nmight be due to limited accessible volume in amorphous CC1. The location \\nanalysis in amorphous CC3 shows that a larger portion of the simulation is spent \\noutside cage voids in amorphous CC3 than CC1. This may be due to the greater \\namount of extrinsic pore volume and connectivity of amorphous CC3.  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nSimulation of gas diffusion in amorphous porous organic cages \\n209 \\n \\nH2 location in amorphous CC1       N2 location in amorphous CC1 \\n  \\nH2 location in amorphous CC3       N2 location in amorphous CC3 \\nFigure 13.

In amorphous CC3, the time for \\n10 % cage occupancy for N2 diffusion is ~ 2000 ps and ~ 4000 ps, respectively. The \\nresults indicate a faster diffusion in amorphous CC3 than CC1. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nSimulation of gas diffusion in amorphous porous organic cages \\n216 \\n \\n6.6.2 Gas hopping analysis  \\nMolecular simulations of a H2 or N2 in amorphous CC1 and CC3 were run for 10 ns \\nusing an NPT ensemble for gas hopping analysis. The total number of window hop \\nand true hop are calculated in this work. A window hop is where a gas molecule \\nmoves from the cage window and then back to its original cavity. A true hop is \\ndefined as the movement of a gas molecule through the cage window to a different \\ncage.  \\nIn order to check the effect of the time interval for sampling the trajectory on the gas \\nhopping analysis, a 500 ps MD simulation of N2 diffusion in amorphous CC3 was \\ncarried out with a various steps of printing trajectory. Table 7 shows that the number \\nof window hops is significantly dependent on how frequently the trajectory is printed. \\nFor example, the number of window hops is 4531 when the trajectory is printed \\nevery 100 steps, however, the number of window hop becomes 481 when printing \\nthe trajectory every 1000 steps. Unlike the window hops, the number of true hops is \\nkept constant with different time interval for printing the trajectory as it is a less \\nfrequent event. It is noted that a large number of window hops occurred for N2 \\ndiffusion in amorphous CC3. If the trajectory is printed every 100 steps, the window \\nhop is roughly 1000 times more frequent than the true hop.   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nSimulation of gas diffusion in amorphous porous organic cages \\n217 \\n \\nTable 7.

The time \\nof one true hop in amorphous CC1 is 61 ps, three times longer than one true hop \\ntime of 19 ps for N2 in amorphous CC3.  \\nThe hopping analysis indicates that N2 diffusion is hindered in amorphous CC1 in \\ncomparison to H2 diffusion in amorphous CC1, presumably due to the smaller size of \\nthe H2 gas molecule. Amorphous CC3 has a larger amount of accessible pore volume \\nand greater connectivity, therefore allowing the N2 or H2 molecule diffuse faster. The \\nresults are consistent with the observations from cage occupancy analysis.  \\n6.6.3 The trajectories of gas molecules in amorphous CC1 and CC3 \\n \\nFigure 17.

The simulation temperature is 300 \\nK. The results show that the H2 molecule has a broader range of displacement \\ncompared with N2 in both amorphous CC1 and CC3. N2 diffusion is in a limited \\nregion in amorphous CC1 as shown in Figure 17 (a). The N2 in amorphous CC3 is \\nable to access a greater range of cages than N2 in amorphous CC1. The difference in \\nthe range of trajectory between H2 and N2 in amorphous CC1 indicates the gas \\nselectivity of amorphous CC1 which is porous to H2, but not to N2. Amorphous CC3 \\nis porous to both H2 and N2.  \\n6.7 Self-diffusivities of H2/N2 in amorphous cage systems to correlate the \\nobservation  \\nMD simulations were performed to study the self-diffusivities of N2 and H2 in \\namorphous CC1 and amorphous CC3.  The simulations were run using NVT \\nensemble for one gas molecule loaded in each model. The total production run is 4 \\nx10\\n7\\n MD steps (20 ns) and with each MD system was equilibrated with 1 x 10\\n5\\n MD \\nsteps. The trajectory was generated every 2000 steps.  \\nThe self-diffusivity describes a movement of a molecule diffusing through a system. \\nIt can be determined by the mean square displacement of molecular trajectories after \\nt time. It is defined using the Einstein expression: \\n            \\n \\n  \\n  \\n \\n     \\n \\n     \\n \\n   (6.1) \\n \\n     is the position vector of a diffusing molecule at time t.  \\n \\n     \\n \\n     is the \\nvector distance travelled by a diffusing molecule over time interval of the length t. \\nThe angular brackets indicate an ensemble average.  \\nTheoretically, self diffusion coefficients Ds can only be accurately calculated when t \\nis close to ∞. Therefore, in MD simulations, a longer simulation time is required to \\ngive a reliable value. Here, a simulation time of 20 ns was used to improve the \\nSimulation of gas diffusion in amorphous porous organic cages \\n220 \\n \\nstatistics in this work. Figure 18 shows the simulated mean square displacements \\n(MSD) plots for H2 and N2 in amorphous CC1 and CC3. At extremely short times, \\nthe motion of the gas molecule is ballistic and the equation can be written as \\n  \\n \\n     \\n \\n     \\n \\n      , therefore the slope of logarithmic plot of MSD is 2.31 There \\nis an intermediate region after the ballistic motion on the MSD plot and the slope of \\nlogarithmic plot is 0.5.\\n31\\n The motion of gas molecule in this region is single file \\ndiffusion. Normal diffusion occurs when the slope of logarithmic plot is 1.\\n31\\n The \\nself-diffusivities for H2 and N2 in amorphous cage systems were determined from the \\ndata of normal diffusion region. For the normal diffusion, the MSDs should increase \\nlinearly with the time which was observed in Figure 18. The self-diffusivities were \\ncalculated in a linear range, 2000 ps   t   3000 for H2 in amorphous CC1, 8000 \\nps   t   10000 ps for N2 in amorphous CC1, 2000 ps   t   3000 ps and 11000 \\nps   t   12000 ps for H2 in amorphous CC3, and 12000 ps   t   14000 ps for \\nN2 in amorphous CC3.

The starting configuration for multiple gas diffusion in amorphous CC1. \\nThe objective of this simulation is to demonstrate gas diffusion and selectivity in \\namorphous CC1. A model was built as shown in Figure 20. The unit cell was 40 x 40 \\nx 170 Å. A slab of amorphous CC1 was placed in the middle of the cell consisting of \\n40 cages and 39 Å x 39 Å x 39 Å dimensions. A slab of graphite was used as a \\nboundary which prevented gas molecules flowing in one direction. One N2 (blue \\ncolour) and one H2 (red colour) molecules were placed in the empty space between \\nthe graphite and the amorphous CC1 slab. A simulation was performed using a NVE \\nensemble with a total production time of 8 ns and an equilibration time of 50 ps. The \\nVerlet leapfrog algorithm was used to integrate the Newton equations. All the \\nLennard-Jones interactions were calculated with a cut off of 10 Å. The time step was \\n0.5 fs and periodic boundary conditions were applied. The simulation was performed \\nat 100 K, a pressure of 1 atm. In addition, the atoms of graphite slab were fixed \\nduring MD simulation. Two cage molecules were fixed in order to prevent \\nmovement of the slab. The remaining cage molecules were allowed to be fully \\nflexible during the simulation.  \\nFigure 21 visualises the trajectories of the respective gas molecules through the \\namorphous CC1. The results are as follows: the H2 molecule penetrates into the \\namorphous CC1 slab. Occasionally it is observed that it diffuses back to the starting \\nSimulation of gas diffusion in amorphous porous organic cages \\n225 \\n \\nposition and travels back into the amorphous CC1 slab. The trajectory shows that the \\nH2 molecule is able to diffuse through amorphous CC1 slab and reach the other side \\nof the slab. In contrast, N2 is able to diffuse into the slab, but it is then trapped inside \\nthe cages, remaining in a limited area of the cage slab for the 8 ns simulation.  \\n \\nFigure 21.

The initial configuration was shown in \\nFigure 22. The gas molecules were placed at one side of the cell and form a thin \\nlayer. The simulation was performed in the NVT ensemble at 300 K and 1 atm \\npressure. The Verlet leapfrog algorithm was used and all the Lennard-Jones \\ninteractions were calculated with a cut off of 10 Å. The time step was 0.5 fs. A total \\nsimulation time was 3 ns with an equilibration time of 50 ps.  \\nFigure 23 shows that H2 molecules are able to diffuse through the whole cells in \\namorphous CC1 and CC3. The pores are fully connected for H2 in both amorphous \\nCC1 and CC3. The trajectory of N2 molecules in amorphous CC1 (Figure 23 b) \\nshows a limited area due to a disconnecting pore volume.

A PERL script was used to \\nanalyse gas hopping ‘routes’. Like driving a vehicle on a road, M, A and B roads are \\nintroduced to classify the hopping. The motorways can clearly demonstrate the \\nconnected cage molecules for gas diffusion. The hopping network can be classified \\nby the number of gas hops that occurred between two cages. We represent \\nconnection by an M motorway when the hopping number is above 20 over a 10 ns \\nsimulation. An A road is the one with hopping number ranging from 6 to 19. The \\nhopping number for a B road is no more than 5. Figure 25 demonstrates the M, A \\nand B motorways for N2 and H2 hopping in amorphous CC3 respectively. The cage \\ncentre of mass was used to represent the cage molecule in the models. It should be \\nnoted that the connecting lines do not represent the diffusion pathways of gas \\nmolecules.  \\nFor N2 diffusion in amorphous CC3 in Figure 25 (a), cage No. 15 and cage No.25 \\nwere involved in a M motorway. The hopping number for these two cages was 479 \\nduring a 10 ns MD simulation which indicated that the majority of cage to cage \\nhopping occurred in this area. A solvent accessible surface area of amorphous CC3 \\nusing a N2 probe radius of 1.82 Å is shown in Figure 26(a),  and a pore channel \\nexisted between cage 15 (coloured as pink) and cage 25 (coloured as green). The \\nextrinsic pore channel fully connected with the intrinsic voids in cage 25 as shown, \\nbut does not connect with cage 15 intrinsic voids in the static structure snapshot. \\nFollowing the N2 diffusion trajectory (red dots) in Figure 26 (b), it was observed N2 \\nmolecule travelled along a channel from cage 25 to cage 15. The connection between \\nthe channel and cage 15 would be expected to form during simulation due to \\ncooperative diffusion, as a result of the cage dynamic motion. No A road contributed \\nto N2 hopping in amorphous CC3.  \\nSimulation of gas diffusion in amorphous porous organic cages \\n232 \\n \\nIn the case of H2 diffusion in amorphous CC3, five M motorways were shown in \\nFigure 25(d). The cage to cage connections occurred between cage 5 and cage 28, \\ncage 15 and cage 25, cage 16 and cage 35, cage 19 and cage 23, cage 27 and cage 28, \\nrespectively. As solvent accessible surface areas using a H2 probe shown in Figure \\n26(c), the hopping between these cages is attributed to the pore connectivity.  A \\nmore complex B road network was displayed for H2 hopping and all the cage \\nmolecules were involved which corresponded to interconnected pore structure.  \\n \\nFigure 25.

The good agreement \\nbetween structural properties of simulated samples and experimental data suggests \\nthat the method generates reliable structural models and represent bulk materials that \\ncan enable further characterisations. A small variation in physical properties is \\nobserved among the simulated samples attributed to the nature of amorphous \\nmaterials. We correlate the dynamic information from the gas diffusion trajectories, \\nhopping and self-diffusivities to rationalize gas selectivity in amorphous CC1 and \\nCC3. The simulation results reveal that N2 diffusion is restricted in amorphous CC1, \\nbut H2 can diffuse through the whole system which is corresponding to H2/N2 gas \\nselectivity of 12 in the experiment. Furthermore, N2 and H2 diffusion in amorphous \\nCC3 is faster than CC1 due to a larger accessible pore volume. The diffusion \\ntrajectories and hopping analysis show that amorphous CC3 are porous to both H2 \\nand N2.  \\nWe emphasize that the simulations provide the detailed information on the \\nmicroscopic structures in these amorphous materials, including gas hopping, \\naccumulative cage occupancy by gas molecules, residential times, and diffusion \\npathways, which can not be achieved by the experimental techniques. We also obtain \\nself-diffusivities of H2 and N2 in amorphous CC1 and CC3 respectively which verify \\ndynamic diffusion and experimental observations. The MD simulations were carried \\nout with different structural samples to provide statistical data for predicting \\nproperties of amorphous materials. This methodology will be applicable to apply to \\nother classes of molecules structure generation and prediction of gas diffusion \\nproperties.   \\n \\n \\nSimulation of gas diffusion in amorphous porous organic cages \\n235 \\n \\n6.12 Chapter acknowledgements \\nIn this chapter, I would like to thank Andy and Abbie for their supervision and \\nsuggestions on my work.

The shape-persistent \\n[4+6] imine cage molecule showed unique tetrahedral symmetry with an internal \\nvoid. Six disordered methyl groups on the cage vertices directed the packing of the \\ncage molecules to form 1D channel. The material demonstrated permanent porosity \\nafter desolvation with a BET surface area of 533 m\\n2 \\ng\\n-1\\n and microporous volume of \\n0.26 cm\\n3\\n g\\n-1\\n.  The total N2 uptake of CC2 was 7.5 mmol g\\n-1\\nat 77 K, 1 bar. It \\nadsorbed 8.9 mmol g\\n-1\\n H2 at 77 K and 7 bar which have exceeded reports for other \\nporous organic molecules. The CH4 sorption capability was 0.95 mmol g\\n-1\\n at 287 K, \\n1 bar and the CO2 uptake of CC2 was 3.0 mmol g\\n-1\\n at 275 K, 1 bar.  \\nA [2+3] ‘propeller’ cage (CC6) was described in Chapter 4. CC6 was synthesized by \\nthe condensation reaction of 1,3,5-tri-(4-formylphenyl) benzene with 1,5-\\npentanediamine in methanol solvent. The material had an ideal selectivity of 11 for \\nCO2/N2 at 300 K, 1 bar. Additionally, it exhibited a H2/N2 selectivity of 2.4 at 77 K, \\n1 bar. The gas selectivity can be rationalized by pore connectivity on the basis of the \\ncrystal packing. The Connolly surface of the crystal structure generated using a N2 \\nprobe radius showed a narrow restricted 1D channel without connecting with ‘side \\npore’ which indicated a low N2 uptake. Although the ideal selectivity of [2+3] \\n‘propeller’ cage was lower than other literature examples, the absolute uptakes were \\nhigher than other [2+3] imine cages. The future challenge would be to design porous \\norganic molecule with both high selectivity and high gas uptake.  \\nThe amorphous porous cage molecules were synthesized by three novel methods \\nwhich were cage-diamine exchange, cage-cage interchange and co-reaction of 1,3,5-\\ntriformylbenzene (TFB) with a mixture of both 1,2-ethylenediamine (EDA) and 1,2-\\ncyclohexanediamine (CHDA) as described in Chapter 5. A distribution of products \\nhad both EDA-linked and CHDA-linked vertices in a single cage molecules. These \\nmolecular species packed together ineffectively, thus creating permanent porosity in \\nthe amorphous solid. The H2/N2 gas selectivity was observed as a function of the \\nEDA: CHDA ratio on the cage vertices in these amorphous cage materials. \\nAmorphous CC1, with all EDA vertices, showed a H2/N2 selectivity of 12 at 77 K, 1 \\nbar.  Amorphous cage materials with high EDA ratios adsorbed much more H2 than \\nConclusions and Future Work \\n241 \\n \\nN2. For example, materials from co-reactions with a ratio of EDA and CHDA to be 5: \\n1 exhibited a H2/N2 selectivity of 5. However, amorphous materials with low EDA \\nratios did not show H2/N2 gas selectivity. For example, amorphous CC3 with all \\nCHDA vertices is highly porous to both H2 and N2. The BET surface area of one of \\nthese amorphous scrambled cage materials was up to 898 m\\n2\\n g\\n-1\\n which has exceeded \\ncrystalline porous cage molecules and other porous amorphous molecules. \\nMolecular simulation has been used to characterize these amorphous porous cage \\nmaterials in Chapter 6. A methodology has been developed to build simulated \\nstructures of amorphous cage materials. The proposed structure generation procedure \\nconsists of four steps: \\n(1) Randomly loading cages at a low density. \\n(2) Stabilization of the initial configuration using NVE ensemble. \\n(3) Compression of the system using NPT ensemble.  \\n(4) A geometry optimization for the configuration.  \\nAll simulated models were characterized by their porosity with surface areas, \\ndensities and microporous volumes. The simulated results show good agreement with \\navailable experimental data. When the models were constructed, molecular dynamic \\nsimulations were then performed for gas diffusion in these amorphous porous \\nmaterials. Gas diffusion trajectories, gas hopping analysis and self-diffusivities were \\ncarried out to rationalize gas selectivity in amorphous CC1 and CC3. The simulation \\nresults revealed that N2 diffusion was restricted in amorphous CC1, but H2 could \\ndiffuse through the whole system for amorphous CC1 which corresponded to the \\nexperimental observation: amorphous CC1 showed selectively porous to H2. \\nFurthermore, N2 and H2 diffusion in amorphous CC3 were faster than CC1 due to a \\nlarger accessible pore volume in amorphous CC3. The diffusion trajectories and \\nhopping analysis showed that amorphous CC3 was porous to both H2 and N2. The \\nself-diffusivities of H2 and N2 in amorphous CC1 and CC3 respectively were \\nobtained which verify dynamic diffusion and experimental observations.  \\n \\nConclusions and Future Work \\n242 \\n \\n7.2 Future work \\nA family of imine cage molecules has been described incorporating a wide range of \\nfunctionalities on the cage vertices in the crystalline solid state. It has been shown \\nthat the functionalities on the cage vertices or cage topologies have a significant \\neffect on the cage molecular packing and porosities of the materials. In the future, \\nfunctionalizing imine cage molecule with metal ions would be explored. The \\nsorption properties for cage molecules before and after doping with metals could be \\ninvestigated using gas sorption isotherms, isosteric heats and binding sites. \\nElectronic or conductive properties could be determined after doping metal ions into \\ncage molecules. Light elements doped porous cage molecules (such as Li and Mg) \\nare expected to enhance H2 storage capacity. Li ions penetrated in porous organic \\ncages could have potential applications in the field of Li battery.  \\nInitially, CC1-CC3 cage molecules were used for metal doping reactions and the \\nresults showed that these cage molecules could not bind with metals. Additionally, \\nthe porous cage molecules with hydroxyl (OH) functional groups were attempted to \\nbe synthesized. The motivation of introducing OH functional groups on the cage \\nmolecules is to involve binding sites for the metal doping. The starting monomer of \\n1,3,5-triformylphloroglucinol shown in Figure 1 could be used for future imine cage \\nsynthesis. 1,3,5-triformylphloroglucinol can be easily synthesized by one step \\nreaction in a high yield from the literature.  \\n \\nFigure 1. 1,3,5-triformylphloroglucinol for future cage synthesis. \\nHere, the preliminary results showed that a [2+3] enol-imine cage molecule were \\nprepared by the condensation reaction of 1,3,5-triformylphloroglucinol and 1,2-\\nethylenediamine in ethanol solvent. The material did not show permanent porosity \\ndue to small voids in the cage molecules and packing close between cage molecules. \\nThe future reactions will be carried out by choosing various diamines and modifying \\nConclusions and Future Work \\n243 \\n \\nreaction conditions in order to form porous [4+6] enol-imine cage molecules. The \\nmetal doping reactions could be further investigated using these enol-imine cage \\nmolecules.    \\n \\nFigure 2. The synthesis of enol-imine cage molecule by the condensation reaction of \\n1,3,5-triformylphloroglucinol and 1,2-ethylenediamine in ethanol solvent. \\nFor amorphous porous molecules, future work can focus on enhancing porosity by \\nintroducing bulkier functionality on the cage vertices, such biphenyl or naphthyl \\ngroups by the co-reaction method. It would also be interesting to combine different \\nmolecule topologies ([2+3] (CC6), [4+6] (CC1-3) or [8+12] (CC7-8) cage) in an \\namorphous solid to investigate porosity and gas selectivity. The amorphous cage \\nmolecules and polymers (such as soluble PIMs or CMPs) could be co-amorphized in \\nthe solid states to form membranes for gas separation. It would be possible to blend \\namorphous cage molecules with some organic molecules with active sites for the \\ncatalysis, fluorescent or photoactive organic molecules for light harvesting, sensing \\nand photocatalysis. More importantly, the simulation methodology for generating \\namorphous cage models would be used to predict properties of materials before \\nsynthesis.  \\n \\nEtOH\\n',\n",

Most organic molecules pack in such a way to minimize free volume, which suggests molecules with permanent porosity in the solid state is rare. In this thesis, an experimental and molecular modeling study of porous organic cages is presented. These porous cage molecules are of interest for a wide range of applications in gas storage, separation and molecular recognition. Compared with other classes of porous materials such as porous frameworks or porous polymers, porous organic molecules possess potential advantages in solubility, molecular mobility and synthetic diversity. A series of tetrahedral imine linked cage molecules can be synthesized by [4+6] cycloimination condensation reaction. The crystalline packing motifs of them can be directed by the vertex functionality giving control over the pore connectivity. The synthesis and characterization of one such cage molecule (CC2) is introduced in Chapter 2. The packing of the CC2 molecules is frustrated by six vertex methyl groups, leading to 1D extrinsic pore channels and isolated intrinsic voids. CC2 adsorbs a number of gases such as N2, H2, CO2 and CH4. The H2 adsorption capacity of this material exceeds reports for other porous organic molecules. In addition, a ‘propeller’ shaped crystalline porous organic cage molecule, CC6, is prepared by [2+3] cycloimination reaction (Chapter 3). The cage molecule has a compact structure with a little void inside the cage. A narrow 1D channel is formed by molecular ineffective packing. The material demonstrates selective adsorption of H2 and CO2 over N2. We have found these cage molecules can inefficiently pack, creating permanent porosity in the amorphous solid state. These scrambled cage molecules are synthesized by either dynamic exchange reactions or co-reactions (Chapter 5). They show a high level of porosity and H2/N2 gas selectivity can be tuned by varying the cage functionality. The BET surface area of up to 898 m2 g-1 exceeds comparable amorphous molecular solids. A methodology is designed to generate amorphous cage structural models and gas diffusion simulations are also performed for these materials in Chapter 6. The simulations provide detailed information of the microscopic structures in these amorphous materials, including gas hopping, accumulative cage occupancy by gas molecules, residential times, and diffusion pathways, which cannot be achieved by experimental techniques.</dc:description><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>http://livrepository.liverpool.ac.uk/8013/1/JiangShan_Oct2012_8013.pdf</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language><dc:subject>QD</dc:subject><dc:title>Synthesis and simulation of porous organic cages</dc:title><rioxxterms:author>Jiang, Shan</rioxxterms:author><rioxxterms:contributor>Cooper, Andy</rioxxterms:contributor><rioxxterms:contributor>Trewin, Abbie</rioxxterms:contributor><rioxxterms:project funder_name=\"Overseas Research Students Awards Scheme\" >Porous organic moelcules</rioxxterms:project><rioxxterms:type>other</rioxxterms:type><rioxxterms:version>AM</rioxxterms:version></rioxx></metadata></record>',\n",

       "    'description': 'The recently developed porous organic molecular cage is a promising class of porous materials, which has already opened new ways for specific reaction environment development, molecular separation and storage, and catalysis. Creation of these small porous cage molecules is challenging because there is no consistent method to synthesize them in organic solvents. Harnessing the congregation capabilities of the cage-precursors in a systematically predictable fashion remains largely empirical. Herein, we use molecular dynamics simulation to predict the likelihood for the self-assembled cage-precursors to advance through each stage of the reaction. We found that with varying arm lengths of the organic precursor, precursors with shorter arm length are statistically more likely to complete these synthetic reactions. This knowledge is useful to guide the design of precursors for synthesizing new porous cages with desired structure',\n",

Creation of these small porous cage molecules is challenging because there is no consistent method to synthesize them in organic solvents. Harnessing the congregation capabilities of the cage-precursors in a systematically predictable fashion remains largely empirical. Herein, we use molecular dynamics simulation to predict the likelihood for the self-assembled cage-precursors to advance through each stage of the reaction. We found that with varying arm lengths of the organic precursor, precursors with shorter arm length are statistically more likely to complete these synthetic reactions. This knowledge is useful to guide the design of precursors for synthesizing new porous cages with desired structure.</dc:description><dc:date>\\n2018-03-13T15:49:13Z</dc:date><dc:date>\\n2018-03-13T15:49:13Z</dc:date><dc:date>\\n2017-12-11</dc:date><dc:date>\\n2017-12</dc:date><dc:type>\\nText</dc:type><dc:type>\\ntext</dc:type><dc:identifier>\\nhttp://hdl.handle.net/2142/99413</dc:identifier><dc:language>\\nen</dc:language><dc:rights>\\nCopyright 2017 Wade Fuerste</dc:rights><dc:format>\\napplication/pdf</dc:format>\\n</oai_dc:dc>\\n</metadata></record>',\n",

In the \\ncage eggs, the ratio n-6/n-3 was significantly (P\\uf03c005) higher (955:1). \\n \\nKey words: laying hens, table eggs, quality, cages, organic. \\n \\nIntroduction \\n \\nThe quality of eggs is influenced by characteristics that are appropriate from \\nthe point of view of consumers. Consumers look forward to freshness, smell, shell \\ncolour and yolk colour. The quality of eggs is determined by microbiological, hygienic, \\nsensory and technological qualities as well. Nowadays, the nutritional quality and \\nhealthiness of table eggs are particularly in favour with consumers. Moreover, they are \\ninterested in production systems and welfare of laying hens. In the EU member \\ncountries, the breeding in conventional cages has been forbidden since 2012. The so- \\ncalled enriched cages and less intensive production systems like barn, free range and \\norganic are allowed. The prohibition of conventional cages would contribute to hen \\nwelfare and health, which will further on contribute to better quality of products. \\nAgroznanje, vol. 13, br.4. 2012, 555-562 556\\nTherefore, we studied the impacts of two production systems (organic and \\nconventional) on some physical and sensory characteristics of eggs as well as fatty acid \\ncomposition. \\n \\nMaterials and methods \\n \\nPullets from Slovenian Prelux-G strain were housed in a barn system with \\nlitter till age 18 weeks when 113 pullets were moved to conventional cages and 50 \\npullets to free range on an organic farm. In each cage a hen had 1287 cm2 of floor \\nspace. Hens in conventional cages were fed with complete feeding mixture for laying \\nhens while in the organic system two thirds of a diet represented feeding mixtures from \\nmaize, triticale, wheat, rye, oats and oilseed and one third of a diet was commercial \\norganic feed for laying hens. Eggs were sampled three times: at the end of July, at the \\nbeginning of September and at the end of September. At first sampling, the hens were \\n69 weeks old, at the second one 75 weeks and at the third one 78 weeks, whilst eggs \\nwere divided into three subsamples. The physical characteristics were measured on \\neggs from the first subsample; sensory attributes were measured on eggs from the \\nsecond subsample and fatty acid composition of yolk from the third one (Table 1).  \\n \\nTab. 1.

The fatty acid content \\nwas determined only in eggs from subsample of first and second samplings. Each \\nsample was analysed in duplicate. Physical characteristics of eggs were measured by \\ncalliper (width and height), mechanical micrometer (shell thickness) and electronic \\napparatus (Technical Services and Supplies, York, England) that include reflectometer, \\nscales, tripod micrometer and colorimeter. The incidence of blood and meat spots was \\nnoticed and the share of eggs with meat and blood spots was calculated but this \\ncharacteristic was not included into statistical analysis. Sensory attributes were \\ndetermined by a team of four trained panellists. The samples were coded. The \\nquantitative descriptive analysis was used to evaluate sensory attributes in the same \\norder as they were perceived.  \\nAgroznanje, vol. 13, br.4. 2012, 555-562 557 \\nWe used a non-structural numerical scale. In the 1 – 7 scale, 1 point means that \\nthe trait is not expressed or that it is unacceptable, while 7 points mean that the trait is \\nstrongly or excellently expressed. pH value was measured by combined glass electrode \\ntype 8431 connected to pH meter (ISKRA Ma 57219). Instrumental analysis of yolk \\ncolour of hard boiled egg was performed by using the chromameter Minolta CR 200b \\nwith computer DATA DP 100. Fatty acid content of yolk was determined by gas \\nchromatography according to Park and Goins (1994). The effect of production system \\non studied characteristics was statistically evaluated by SAS/STAT (SAS User’s \\nGuide, 2000) programme package. \\n \\nResults and discussion \\n \\nThe studied physical characteristics of eggs from two production systems \\nshowed statistically significant differences only in yolk colour and shell thickness \\n(Table 2).  \\n \\nTab. 2.

Hidalgo et al. (2007), Minelli et al. (2007) and Kucukyilmaz et al. (2012) \\nreported on higher yolk yellowness from conventional eggs in comparison to yolks \\nfrom organic eggs. Conventional eggs had thicker shell. The effect of production \\nsystem on shell thickness cannot be easily explained. Rizzi et al. (2006) and Mugnai et \\nal. (2009) found thicker shells in organic eggs in comparison to conventional eggs, but \\non the other hand Hidalgo et al. (2007) reported on diverse results.  \\nIn conventional eggs, the incidence of meat and blood spots (46,7 %) was \\nhigher than in organic eggs (40,0 %). Some meat and blood spots were big but also \\nAgroznanje, vol. 13, br.4. 2012, 555-562 558\\nsmaller spots were also found. In literature data, external characteristics of eggs \\nproduced in different production systems differ considerably, which might be due to \\ndifferently formed experiments, not to mention environmental effects in diverse \\nproduction systems that affect some of the egg traits. \\nFifteen studied sensory attributes determined in fresh and hard boiled eggs \\nfrom two production systems demonstrated statistically significant differences in nine \\nattributes (Table 3).   \\n \\nTab. 3.

The pH value of albumen in \\nAgroznanje, vol. 13, br.4. 2012, 555-562 559 \\nconventional eggs was 9,0±0,34 and in organic eggs 9,25±0,20 while the \\ncorresponding pH value of yolk was 6,14±0,09 and 6,37±0,32. Yolks of hard boiled \\neggs from different production systems statistically significantly differ in colour shade, \\nwhich is shown by values a* and b* (Table 4).   \\n \\nTab. 4.

Similar results for intensiveness \\nof red and yellow yolk colour from conventional and organic eggs were also reported \\nby Minelli et al. (2007).  \\nOrganic eggs were characterised by a higher content of essential linolenic acid \\n(18:3, n-3), and docosapentaenoic acid (22:5, n-3) and n-3 fatty acids and more \\nfavourable ratio of n-6 to n-3 fatty acids than conventional eggs. Conventional eggs \\ncontained more linoleic acid (18:2, n-6) which is an essential acid (Table 5). Different \\ncontents of fatty acids in eggs showed different contents of those acids in feeds that \\nhens were fed on. Lopez-Bote et al. (1998) reported that organic eggs contained more \\nn-3 (2.6 times) and less n-6 fatty acids in comparison to conventional eggs. It is well \\nknown that fresh fodder (grass, legumes) is rich in n-3 and poor in n-6 fatty acids. The \\ntotal content of saturated fatty acids (SFA), mono unsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) and \\npoly unsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) did not differ in eggs from both production \\nsystems. Similar results were found by Matt et al. (2009) who did not find significant \\ndifferences in contents of SFA, MUFA and PUFA in eggs produced in conventional \\nand organic production systems. \\n \\nConclusion \\n \\nEggs produced by Prelux –G hens of the same age in conventional and organic \\nproduction systems differed significantly in external traits, namely intensity of yolk \\ncolour and thickness of shell. Yolks from conventional eggs were more yellow \\n(p≤0.0001) and had thicker shell (p=0.0262) than organic eggs. \\nFresh eggs from conventional cages achieved better marks than organic eggs \\nin smell and yolk consistency while hard boiled eggs in smell, steadiness of yolk \\ncolour, texture, taste, total impression and yolk colour. \\nThe redness in yolks of hard boiled conventional eggs was significantly higher \\nwhile yellowness was significantly lower than in organic eggs. \\nAgroznanje, vol. 13, br.4. 2012, 555-562 560\\nEggs produced by Prelux-G hens in organic production system had more \\nfavourable fatty acid composition than conventional eggs because they contained \\nsignificantly more linolenic acid (18:3, n-3), docosapentaenoic acid (22:5, n-3) and \\ntotal n-3 fatty acids. The ratio of n-6 to n-3 (5,93) fatty acids was more favourable in \\norganic eggs than in conventional ones (9,55). Conventional eggs contained more \\nlinoleic acid (18:2, n-6). \\n \\nTab. 5.

The effects of a production system were investigated on external and internal quality and on the sensory attributes. The eggs produced in organic system had paler yolks (P<0.001) and thinner egg shells (P<0.05) than the eggs produced in the cages. Overall sensory quality was improved in eggs deriving from hens allocated in cages. Differences between organic and cage eggs indicated lower redness and higher yellowness (P<0.001) in organic eggs than in cage eggs. The organic eggs were characterised by a higher content of a-linolenic and docosapentaenoic acid (P<0.05) and lower content of linoleic acid (P<0.05) than the eggs from cages. The ratio of omega fatty acids, n-6/n-3, was most favourable in the organic eggs (5.93:1). In the cage eggs, the ratio n-6/n-3 was significantly (P<005) higher (955:1).</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"rs-RS\" >\\n\\tUniversity of Banja Luka, Faculty of Agriculture</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"rs-RS\" >\\n\\t</dc:contributor><dc:date>\\n\\t2012-12-28</dc:date><dc:type>\\n\\tinfo:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>\\n\\tinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"rs-RS\" >\\n\\tСтручно рецензиран чланак</dc:type><dc:format>\\n\\tapplication/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>\\n\\thttp://doisrpska.nub.rs/index.php/agroznanje/article/view/658</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>\\n\\t10.7251/AGREN1204555T</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"rs-RS\" >\\n\\tАГРОЗНАЊЕ; Свеска 13, Бр. 4 (2012): Агрознање / Agro-knowledge Journal; 555-562</dc:source><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\" >\\n\\tAGRO - KNOWLEDGE JOURNAL; Свеска 13, Бр. 4 (2012): Агрознање / Agro-knowledge Journal; 555-562</dc:source><dc:source>\\n\\t2233-0070</dc:source><dc:language>\\n\\tsrp</dc:language><dc:relation>\\n\\thttp://doisrpska.nub.rs/index.php/agroznanje/article/view/658/603</dc:relation>\\n</oai_dc:dc>\\n\\t\\t\\t</metadata>\\n\\t\\t</record>',\n",

In this work, we use molecular\\ndynamics simulations to examine the multicomponent gas storage in\\na porous liquid consisting of crown-ether-substituted cage molecules\\ndissolved in a 15-crown-5 solvent. We compute the storage of three\\nprototypical small molecules including CO<sub>2</sub>, CH<sub>4</sub>, and N<sub>2</sub> and their binary mixtures in individual cage\\nmolecules. For porous liquids in equilibrium with a binary 1:1 gas\\nmixture bath with partial gas pressure of 27.5 bar, a cage molecule\\nshows a selectivity of 4.3 and 13.1 for the CO<sub>2</sub>/CH<sub>4</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2</sub> pairs, respectively. We\\nprovide a molecular perspective of how gas molecules are stored in\\nthe cage molecule and how the storage of one type of gas molecule\\nis affected by other types of gas molecules. Our results clarify the\\nmolecular mechanisms behind the selectivity of such cage molecules\\ntoward different gases.</dc:description><dc:date>\\n          2017-05-18T00:00:00Z</dc:date><dc:type>\\n          Dataset</dc:type><dc:type>\\n          Media</dc:type><dc:identifier>\\n          10.1021/acs.jpcc.7b01260.s002</dc:identifier><dc:relation>\\n          https://figshare.com/articles/Multicomponent_Gas_Storage_in_Organic_Cage_Molecules/5048890</dc:relation><dc:rights>\\n          CC BY-NC 4.0</dc:rights>\\n        </oai_dc:dc>\\n      </metadata>\\n    </record>',\n",

MOFs \\nexploit reversible metal–coordination chemistry to create extended, crystalline solids.1 \\nHowever, a similar set of porous ordered covalent networks based on the reversible and \\nmodular connection of a vast array of rigid and symmetrical building blocks through \\ncovalent bonds has also emerged during this time. These materials, coined as \\n“Covalent Organic Frameworks (COFs)”, have summoned considerable attention in the \\nlast decade, starting with a significant contribution from the Yaghi group,2 owing to their \\nunique designing features as well as enormous potential.3 Like COFs, porous molecular \\ncrystals that are not interconnected by covalent bonding have also picked up significant \\nresearch interest.

As exemplified by the \\narticles, this themed issue focuses on the design strategies for the construction of \\nporous organic materials, including covalent organic frameworks and organic cage \\nstructures with new physicochemical properties. Associated challenges regarding \\nsynthesis, crystallization, and structure–property relationships of covalent organic \\nframeworks and organic cage structures are also covered. \\n \\nAn earlier themed issue on this topic edited by Andrew Cooper showcased the \\nversatility of the COFs synthesized by reversible boronate ester bonds.2 This \\ncurrent themed issue, however, showcases a diverse number of synthetic procedures, \\nother than the reversible boronate ester bonds, to produce ordered crystalline porous \\nsolids with physical properties, such as sensing, separation, and conductivity, rather \\nthan focusing only on porosity. A collection of twelve research articles on covalent \\norganic frameworks and organic cage structures is presented, which showcase the very \\nsignificant fact that the COFs are not limited to boronate ester chemistry, nor are porous \\norganic solids restricted to extended networks. The article by Andrew Cooper and co-\\nworkers (DOI: 10.1039/C7CE00783C) showcases the strategy towards modulating the \\nassembly of porous organic cage crystals, whereas the article by Antonio Frontera and \\nco-workers (DOI: 10.1039/C6CE02341J) describes the solid-state inclusion phenomena \\nwithin a Zn-Porphyrin Cage.  \\n \\nMany of the articles have exploited the imine bond formation reaction, which has proved \\nto be effective for generating highly porous materials and are represented by a number \\nof articles in this issue. Felix Zamora and coworkers, along these lines, have \\nshowcased the self-assembly of an imine-based covalent organic framework into \\nnanospheres. The articles by Yushan Yan and co-workers (DOI: \\n10.1039/C7CE00042A),  Qingyuan Yang and co-workers  and Dan Zhao and co-\\nworkers (DOI: 10.1039/C7CE00344G)  on the topic of anion conduction, capture of \\nradioactive iodine and hydrocarbon uptake and separation by COFs, confirm that \\nthe properties of porous organic materials are not restricted to porosity alone.  \\n  \\nThe other articles in this issue by Hong-Cai Zhou and co-workers on the topic of flexible \\ncovalent organic frameworks (DOI: 10.1039/C7CE00593H); Ronald Smaldone and \\ncoworkers  on the effect of fluorine substituents on the properties of covalent organic \\nframeworks (DOI: 10.1039/C7CE00598A); Xin Zhao and coworkers  on hetero-\\npore covalent organic frameworks (DOI: 10.1039/C7CE00590C) and by Dana Medina \\nand co-workers  on fluorescence labeling of covalent organic frameworks (DOI: \\n10.1039/C7CE00684E)  indicate the diverse opportunities  for generating and \\nunderstanding the structure–property relationships among these porous organic \\nmaterials. \\n \\nThe articles included in this issue contribute to a growing argument that porous \\ncrystalline organic solids do present an exciting alternative compared to their metal–\\norganic [MOFs] or inorganic [Zeolites] equivalents for certain applications, and opens up \\nnew possibilities, such as membrane separation and solution processability. \\n \\nWe would like to extend our thanks to all the authors who have contributed articles to \\nthis themed issue, as well as to the editorial staff of CrystEngComm who have worked \\nhard to put this issue together. \\n  \\n \\nReferences: \\n \\n1.

As exemplified by the \\narticles, this themed issue focuses on the design strategies for the construction of \\nporous organic materials, including covalent organic frameworks and organic cage \\nstructures with new physicochemical properties. Associated challenges regarding \\nsynthesis, crystallization, and structure–property relationships of covalent organic \\nframeworks and organic cage structures are also covered. \\n \\nAn earlier themed issue on this topic edited by Andrew Cooper showcased the \\nversatility of the COFs synthesized by reversible boronate ester bonds.2 This \\ncurrent themed issue, however, showcases a diverse number of synthetic procedures, \\nother than the reversible boronate ester bonds, to produce ordered crystalline porous \\nsolids with physical properties, such as sensing, separation, and conductivity, rather \\nthan focusing only on porosity. A collection of twelve research articles on covalent \\norganic frameworks and organic cage structures is presented, which showcase the very \\nsignificant fact that the COFs are not limited to boronate ester chemistry, nor are porous \\norganic solids restricted to extended networks. The article by Andrew Cooper and co-\\nworkers (DOI: 10.1039/C7CE00783C) showcases the strategy towards modulating the \\nassembly of porous organic cage crystals, whereas the article by Antonio Frontera and \\nco-workers (DOI: 10.1039/C6CE02341J) describes the solid-state inclusion phenomena \\nwithin a Zn-Porphyrin Cage.  \\n \\nMany of the articles have exploited the imine bond formation reaction, which has proved \\nto be effective for generating highly porous materials and are represented by a number \\nof articles in this issue. Felix Zamora and coworkers, along these lines, have \\nshowcased the self-assembly of an imine-based covalent organic framework into \\nnanospheres. The articles by Yushan Yan and co-workers (DOI: \\n10.1039/C7CE00042A),  Qingyuan Yang and co-workers  and Dan Zhao and co-\\nworkers (DOI: 10.1039/C7CE00344G)  on the topic of anion conduction, capture of \\nradioactive iodine and hydrocarbon uptake and separation by COFs, confirm that \\nthe properties of porous organic materials are not restricted to porosity alone.  \\n  \\nThe other articles in this issue by Hong-Cai Zhou and co-workers on the topic of flexible \\ncovalent organic frameworks (DOI: 10.1039/C7CE00593H); Ronald Smaldone and \\ncoworkers  on the effect of fluorine substituents on the properties of covalent organic \\nframeworks (DOI: 10.1039/C7CE00598A); Xin Zhao and coworkers  on hetero-\\npore covalent organic frameworks (DOI: 10.1039/C7CE00590C) and by Dana Medina \\nand co-workers  on fluorescence labeling of covalent organic frameworks (DOI: \\n10.1039/C7CE00684E)  indicate the diverse opportunities  for generating and \\nunderstanding the structure–property relationships among these porous organic \\nmaterials. \\n \\nThe articles included in this issue contribute to a growing argument that porous \\ncrystalline organic solids do present an exciting alternative compared to their metal–\\norganic [MOFs] or inorganic [Zeolites] equivalents for certain applications, and opens up \\nnew possibilities, such as membrane separation and solution processability. \\n \\nWe would like to extend our thanks to all the authors who have contributed articles to \\nthis themed issue, as well as to the editorial staff of CrystEngComm who have worked \\nhard to put this issue together. \\n  \\n \\nReferences: \\n \\n1.

Although these materials do resemble COFs, unlike COFs, they can be solution processable.4 For any structural chemists, these materials are excellent tools that can lead to more informed design processes and create a deeper understanding of how targeted porous extended structures should be made.</dc:description><dc:language>en</dc:language><dc:publisher>Royal Society of Chemistry</dc:publisher><dc:source>1466-8033</dc:source><dc:title>Covalent organic frameworks and organic cage structures</dc:title><dcterms:dateAccepted>2017-07-11</dcterms:dateAccepted><rioxxterms:author>Banerjee, Rahul</rioxxterms:author><rioxxterms:author>Champness, Neil R.</rioxxterms:author><rioxxterms:publication_date>2017-08-09</rioxxterms:publication_date><rioxxterms:type>Journal Article/Review</rioxxterms:type><rioxxterms:version>NA</rioxxterms:version><rioxxterms:version_of_record>http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/C7CE90115A</rioxxterms:version_of_record></rioxx></metadata></record>',\n",

INTRODUCTION\\nIn 1997, a preliminary survey of numbering and nomenclature for fullerenes prepared by a working\\ngroup appointed by the President of IUPAC, Alan Bard, was published [1]. It described two types of\\nnames for fullerenes, one proposed by some workers in the field and the one used by Chemical\\nAbstracts Service (CAS); and two systems for numbering fullerene skeletons, one proposed in a publi-\\ncation by R. Taylor [2] and one published by CAS [3]. In addition, alternative methods for naming\\nderivatives of fullerenes were discussed. However, no approved IUPAC recommendations were con-\\ntained in the IUPAC preliminary survey [1]. The present report contains approved IUPAC recommen-\\ndations for naming and numbering the C60-Ih and C70-D5h(6) fullerenes and their derivatives. It is lim-\\nited to these fullerenes because there are only a very small number of known derivatives of only a few\\nother fullerenes. Apart from the numbering and identification of other fullerenes with degenerate point\\ngroup symbols, which will require complex rules, the nomenclature for all fullerenes can be amply\\nillustrated by the derivatives of these two fullerenes. \\n© 2002 IUPAC, Pure and Applied Chemistry 74, 629–695\\nNomenclature for the C60-Ih and C70-D5h(6) fullerenes 631\\nFU-1. DEFINITIONS\\nFu-1.1 Fullerenes\\nThe classical definition of a fullerene is a compound composed solely of an even number of carbon\\natoms which form a cage-like fused-ring polycyclic system with 12 five-membered rings and the rest\\nsix-membered rings; the archetypal example is the 60-atom structure, where the atoms and bonds delin-\\neate a truncated icosahedron [4,5]. However, the term has been broadened to include any closed-cage\\nstructure having 20 or more carbon atoms consisting entirely of 3 coordinate carbon atoms [3].\\nFu-1.2 Fulleranes \\nFulleranes are fully saturated fullerenes, for example, the hydrocarbon C60H60.\\nFu-1.3 Fulleroids\\nHeterofullerenes, norfullerenes, homofullerenes, and secofullerenes have been called fulleroids\\n(fullerene-like) because they resemble fullerenes in structure but do not conform to the definition of a\\nfullerene as given above. It is convenient to refer to them as fulleroids and name them as modified\\nfullerenes.\\nFU-2. NAMES\\nFu-2.1 Systematic names\\nThe recommended systematic names for the icosahedral C60 and the D5h(6)-C70 fullerenes are \\n(C60-Ih)[5,6]fullerene and (C70-D5h(6))[5,6]fullerene. The parenthetical prefix gives the carbon content\\nand the point group symbol; and the bracketed numbers indicate the ring sizes in the fullerene. The lat-\\nter is important in fullerenes with rings other than five- and six-membered. The subscript parenthetical\\n(6) following the point group symbol D5h in the latter name indicates that the five-membered ring on\\nthe five-fold symmetry axis is surrounded by six-membered rings. This differentiates this fullerene from\\nan isomeric (C70-D5h)[5,6]fullerene, which has five-membered rings surrounding the five-membered\\nring on the five-fold symmetry axis, which would have the name (C70-D5h(5))[5,6]fullerene. This tech-\\nnique is being further evaluated to determine its value for differentiating among other fullerenes with\\ndegenerate point group symbols. The recommended names have the same information as the corre-\\nsponding CAS names, but in a different format.\\nFu-2.2 Trivial names\\nThe names [60-Ih]fullerene and [70-D5h]fullerene given in the IUPAC Preliminary Survey [1] are names\\nfirst introduced into the literature for the C60-Ih and C70-D5h(6) fullerenes. Since important structural\\ninformation is omitted from these names, they are to be considered as trivial names to be used only for\\nthese specific compounds. \\nFU-3. NUMBERING\\nFu-3.1 Systematic numbering\\nSystematic numbering for (C60-Ih)[5,6]fullerene and (C70-D5h(6))[5,6]fullerene is based on the follow-\\ning rules adapted from the CAS publication [3]. These rules are sufficient to systematically number\\n(C60-Ih)[5,6]fullerene and (C70-D5h(6))[5,6]fullerene. More rules are needed for other fullerenes. The\\nCAS rules [3] are being evaluated and, if found appropriate, will be included in a subsequent report.\\nW. H. POWELL et al.\\n© 2002 IUPAC, Pure and Applied Chemistry 74, 629–695\\n632\\nFu-3.1.1\\nProper rotation axes, (Cn), are examined in sequence, from the highest-order to the lowest-order axis,\\nuntil at least one contiguous spiral pathway is found that begins in a ring through which a proper rota-\\ntion axis passes, at the end of a bond bisected by a proper rotation axis, or at an atom through which a\\nproper rotation axis passes. Numbering begins at the end of such a contiguous spiral pathway. \\nFu-3.1.2\\nIf there is a choice for the selection of a reference axis or for the end of a reference axis to begin the\\nnumbering, a ring is preferred to a bond, which, in turn is preferred to an atom.\\nFu-3.1.2.1\\nWhen there is a choice between rings, a larger ring is preferred to a smaller one. Where there is still a\\nchoice, the preferred ring contains the preferred atom (see Fu-3.1.2.3) at the first point of difference. \\nFu-3.1.2.2\\nWhen there is a choice between bonds, the preferred bond is the common bond between the set of\\nlargest rings, for example, 66 > 65 > 55. Where there is still a choice, the preferred bond contains the\\npreferred atom (see Fu-3.1.2.3) at the first point of difference.\\nFu-3.1.2.3\\nWhen there is a choice among atoms, the preferred atom is the common atom in the set of largest rings,\\nfor example, 666 > 665 > 655 > 555.\\nFu-3.1.3\\nWhere there is a choice of spiral pathways for numbering, the preferred pathway terminates as close as\\npossible, in terms of the number of bonds, to the axis of the spiral. \\nFu-3.2 Systematic numbering for (C60-Ih)[5,6]fullerene \\nThis fullerene (see Fig. 1) has six equivalent C5 axes passing through opposite pentagons, each of which\\ngives identical contiguous spiral pathways in either direction from any atom of any pentagon. Thus,\\neach of these C5 axes can be the reference axis. According to Fu-3.1.1, it is not necessary to investigate\\nany of the ten equivalent C3 axes passing through opposite hexagons nor the 15 equivalent C2 axes pass-\\ning through opposite bonds, all of which give contiguous spiral pathways. The systematic numbering is\\ngiven in Fig. 1 in both 3-D and Schlegel format.a\\n© 2002 IUPAC, Pure and Applied Chemistry 74, 629–695\\nNomenclature for the C60-Ih and C70-D5h(6) fullerenes 633\\na In this document, the convention for Schlegel diagrams is that the central polygon is considered to be closer to the viewer.\\nb For clarity, double bonds are not shown in fullerene structures throughout this report.\\nFig. 1 Systematic numbering for (C60-Ih)[5,6]fullereneb.\\n3-D Representation            Schlegel Representationa\\nFu-3.3 Systematic numbering for (C70-D5h(6))[5,6]fullerene \\nThe principal axis for this fullerene (see Fig. 3) is the C5 axis through opposite pentagons. There are no\\ncontiguous spiral pathways from any atom in either pentagon and thus the C5 axis cannot be a reference\\naxis. Therefore, possible contiguous spiral pathways must be investigated from any of the five equiva-\\nlent C2 axes that pass through the center of a six-membered ring at one end and bisect the bond between\\nthe two six-membered rings at the other end (see Fig. 2a). Since, according to Fu-3.1.2, a ring is pre-\\nferred to a bond, the search for a contiguous spiral pathway must start in the six-membered ring. There\\nare twelve possible pathways, one in each direction, clockwise and anticlockwise from each atom of the\\nsix-membered ring. However, because of symmetry, atoms marked ‘a’ in Fig. 2a are equivalent, as are\\natoms marked ‘b’ Therefore, there are only three possible pathways to explore, i.e., ‘bab’, clockwise\\n(Fig. 2b); ‘abb’, clockwise (Fig. 2c); and ‘bba’, clockwise (Fig. 2d). The clockwise ‘bab’ pathway (Fig.\\n2b) terminates at atom ‘c’ at the end of the bond bisected by the reference axis. The clockwise ‘abb’\\npathway (Fig. 2c) and the clockwise ‘bba’ pathway (Fig. 2d) terminate at ‘c′’, an atom at the end of a\\nbond one removed from the bond bisected by the reference axis, and ‘c″’, an atom at the end of a bond\\ntwo removed from the bond bisected by the reference axis, respectively. Thus, according to Fu-3.1.3,\\nthe preferred contiguous spiral pathway for numbering is the clockwise ‘bab’ pathway (Fig. 2b) and\\nthus the systematic numbering for (C70-D5h(6))[5,6]fullerene is that shown in Fig. 3.\\nW.

STRUCTURALLY MODIFIED FULLERENES\\nModification of fullerene structures by the addition or deletion of atoms, or by the breaking or forma-\\ntion of bonds is described by the prefixes ‘homo’, ‘nor’, ‘seco’, and ‘cyclo’ in a manner similar to their\\nuse in organic stereoparent nomenclature, including their combinations [6].\\nFu-4.1 Homofullerenes\\nThe replacement of a carbon–carbon bond of a fullerene by a methylene group is described by attach-\\ning the nondetachable prefix ‘homo’ to the name of the parent fullerene. The original numbering of the\\nparent fullerene is retained. The location of the homo operation is described by a complex locant formed\\naccording to the method devised for insertion of a methylene group into a bond sector of a stereoparent\\n[6]. The complex locant is formed by adding the letters ‘a’, ‘b’, etc. to the pair of locants for the\\nreplaced bond which are the lowest locants consistent with the numbering of the fullerene, and enclos-\\ning the higher number in parentheses, for example, ‘1(9)a’; such complex locants must be used in par-\\nent names, but where there is no ambiguity, simple locants formed by adding the letter ‘a’ to the lower\\nlocant, such as ‘1a’ for the case above, may be used in structural formulas and for citation of sub-\\nstituents, etc.\\n© 2002 IUPAC, Pure and Applied Chemistry 74, 629–695\\nNomenclature for the C60-Ih and C70-D5h(6) fullerenes 635\\n3-D Representation                             Schlegel Representationc\\n(viewed along the C5 axis)\\nFig. 3 Systematic numbering for (C70-D5h(6))[5,6]fullerened.\\nc In this document, the convention for Schlegel diagrams is that the central polygon is considered to be closer to the viewer.\\nd For clarity, double bonds are not shown in fullerene structures throughout this report.\\nBecause of the possibility of rearrangement of the double bonds in homofullerene structures, indi-\\ncated hydrogen is used to designate the ‘extra’ hydrogen on the homo atom, even for di-, tri-, tetra-, etc.\\nhomofullerenes that could be considered to be hydro derivatives of fully unsaturated structures (see\\nExamples II and III, below).\\nNote: A complex locant format is used by CAS [3] in which the higher-numbered locant and the\\nletter ‘a’ are enclosed in parentheses following the locants of the replaced bond, as 1,2(2a); the\\ncorresponding simple locant for the added methylene group would be 2a. This was done in an\\nattempt to remove the ambiguity in dihomofullerenes where two of the homo bonds originate\\nfrom the same atom (see Example III, below), where, according to the preliminary fullerene\\nreport [1], both homo atoms would be assigned the same locant.

As a result, the connectivity of remaining atoms may be reduced from three to two, which\\nrequires the presence of hydrogen atoms. An even number of hydrogen atoms is implied by the name;\\nif there is an odd number, one is expressed as indicated hydrogen because one carbon atom has changed\\nfrom sp2 to sp3 hybridization. A connectivity of three may also be satisfied by a heteroatom, such as\\n© 2002 IUPAC, Pure and Applied Chemistry 74, 629–695\\nNomenclature for the C60-Ih and C70-D5h(6) fullerenes 637\\nnitrogen or boron and a connectivity of two by a heteroatom such as oxygen or sulfur. Where there is a\\nchoice, locants for the atoms removed and indicated hydrogen are as low as possible.\\nNote 1: In organic stereoparent nomenclature atoms removed by the ‘nor’ operation are those hav-\\ning the highest possible number of the ring or chain segment [6].\\nNote 2: The main problem with the ‘nor’ operation is the limit to the number of carbon atoms that\\ncan be removed from a particular fullerene structure. Eventually, systematic ring nomenclature\\nwill provide a name that may be easier to understand than a polynorfullerene name. It would not\\nbe helpful to set a precise number of carbon atoms that can be removed by the nor operation; a\\nrealistic figure would depend a lot on whether blocks of carbon atoms or isolated carbon atoms\\nare being removed. For CAS, more than 20 % of the carbon atoms of a fullerene cannot be\\nremoved by the nor operation unless it can be shown to be a special situation. For (C60-Ih)[5,6]-\\nfullerene and (C70-D5h(6))[5,6]fullerene it is recommended that at least two ‘belts’ of rings or at\\nleast one-half of the atoms of the parent fullerene must remain intact after the ‘nor’ operation.\\nExamples:\\nI 2H-1-Nor(C60-Ih)[5,6]fullerene\\nII 1,9-Dinor(C60-Ih)[5,6]fullerene\\nIII 6H-1,2,3,4,5-Pentanor(C60-Ih)[5,6]fullerene \\nIV 8,23,24,25-Tetranor(C70-D5h(6))[5,6]fullerene\\nW.

FULLERENE DERIVATIVES \\nFu-6.1 Fulleranes\\nFulleranes are fully saturated fullerenes, i.e., CnHn, and their derivatives, radicals, and ions, can be\\nnamed by application of the principles of substitutive nomenclature normal to saturated hydrocarbons.\\nExamples:\\nI (C60-Ih)[5,6]Fulleran-1-yl                 IV (C60-Ih)[5,6]Fulleran-1-ide \\nII (C60-Ih)[5,6]Fulleran-1-ylium           V (C60-Ih)[5,6]Fulleran-9-id-1-yl\\nIII (C60-Ih)[5,6]Fulleran-9-ylium-1-yl    VI (C60-Ih)[5,6]Fulleran-1-ol\\nFu-6.2 Fullerenes\\nFullerenes however, do not have hydrogen atoms for direct substitution and thus their derivatives, rad-\\nicals, and ions, are named by application of the principles of substitutive nomenclature applicable to\\nfusion atoms of fused ring systems, for example, the 4a and 8a positions of naphthalene. The charac-\\nteristic group names and substituent prefix names normal to substitutive nomenclature are used.\\nNote: The lack of hydrogen atoms for substitution in fullerenes led to the conclusion in the pre-\\nliminary survey [1] that atoms and groups attached to fullerenes should be designated as addends\\nand not substituents. This would imply that principles of additive nomenclature should be used\\nwhich might lead to names such as dibromo[60-Ih]fullerene. However, this leads to difficulties\\nsince such names are, in fact, formed by coordination nomenclature (bromo is the current ligand\\nname for Br), a nomenclature method not approved for use with carbon compounds; the additive\\noperation in the nomenclature of organic compounds would produce names such as [60-Ih]fullerene\\ndibromide, for C60Br2. Since such additive names have been discarded in the nomenclature of\\norganic compounds, where substitutive names are preferred, the only acceptable method is to use\\nsubstitutive nomenclature, in which atoms and groups cited as prefixes substitute hydrogen atoms\\npreviously added by means of the additive prefix ‘hydro’; or groups cited as suffixes require the\\nconcomitant addition of hydrogen atoms cited as ‘added hydrogen’. Thus, names such as \\n1,9-dibromo-1,9-dihydro(C60-Ih)[5,6]fullerene and (C60-Ih)[5,6]fulleren-1(9H)-ol result, names\\nthat are fully in accordance with the principles, rules, and conventions of substitutive nomencla-\\nture. This approach provides a completely consistent method for naming fullerenes with atoms or\\ngroups attached to skeletal carbon atoms and all compounds derived from them.\\nW. H.

FULLERENES AND MODIFIED FULLERENES FUSED TO ORGANIC RINGS OR\\nRING SYSTEMS\\nFullerenes that share an adjacent pair of atoms with an organic ring or ring system are named by adapt-\\ning and extending the principles of fusion nomenclature [9]. As in normal organic fused ring systems,\\nthe pair of atoms shared by the fullerene and the organic ring or ring system is regarded as part of both\\ncomponents. However, unlike organic fused ring systems, each component retains its own bonding pat-\\ntern and numbering. Because of the nature of bonding in fullerenes, the fusion bond is always a single\\nbond and the fusion atoms cannot accept an ‘exo’ double bond. After fusion, nonfullerene components\\nother than alicyclic bi- and polycyclic ring systems have the maximum number of double bonds and\\nindicated hydrogen is cited as needed.\\nNote: Although when the nonfullerene component is a simple ring, such as cyclopropane or\\noxirene, the additional atoms could be cited by means of bridge prefixes, such as methano and\\nepoxy, for consistency it is recommended that all be named as fused systems. Both methods were\\nincluded in the preliminary survey [1]. It is clear that as the attached organic system becomes\\nmore complex, the formation of bridge names becomes more difficult. For example, the CAS\\nRing Systems Handbook [10] contains many examples of a fullerene fused to two organic rings\\nwhich themselves are connected by a bridge. For bridged fullerenes, see Fu-8.\\nOrganic rings and ring systems, including monocyclic rings and all polycyclic ring systems\\nexcept spiro ring systems, are always cited as prefixes to the name of the fullerene or modified fullerene.\\nSpiro systems that might be considered as fused to a fullerene are treated as spiro systems between\\nmodified fullerenes or fused fullerene systems and other components (see Fu-9). Each system retains\\nits own name and numbering both for indicating fusion sites and for indicating positions of substitution.\\nThe fullerene locants are always unprimed and primes are added to the locants of the fused organic rings\\nin the order described below. The fusion is described by citing the primed locants of the organic ring\\nW. H. POWELL et al.\\n© 2002 IUPAC, Pure and Applied Chemistry 74, 629–695\\n652\\ncomponent and the unprimed locants of the fullerene in that order, enclosed in brackets and separated\\nby a colon. Locants for monocyclic hydrocarbon components are usually omitted.\\nNote: CAS prefixes the fullerene name to that of a heterocyclic ring system when the latter has a\\nheteroatomic component preferred to the fullerene component [3]. For example, a fullerene com-\\nponent with no heteroatoms would be prefixed to any heterocyclic component, but a nitrogenous\\nheterocyclic component would be prefixed to an nitrogenous fullerene component. This method\\nwas chosen for consistency with normal organic fusion nomenclature where heterocycles are pre-\\nferred as base components. When the heterocycle is a monocycle, a fused ring system used as a\\nbase component in ordinary fusion nomenclature, or a heterocyclic ring system that is bridged,\\nthe fusion site is described by citing the unprimed locants of the fullerene component followed\\nby the letter locant for the fusion side of the heterocycle. However, when the heterocycle is itself\\na fused ring system, a bridged fused system that is not a base component, or a bridged nonfused\\nheterocycle, the fusion locants of the fullerene component are primed and those of the heterocy-\\ncle are unprimed. As a result in the latter case, the fusion locants are not the same as the locants\\nused for substitution, which are unprimed for the fullerene component and primed for the non-\\nfullerene component, a situation that could be confusing. This situation is defended by the notion\\nthat locants within brackets in fusion names are those of the components, and are not the locants\\nof the complete fused system.

CONFIGURATIONAL SPECIFICATION FOR THE C60-Ih AND C70-D5h(6)\\nFULLERENES AND THEIR DERIVATIVES\\nThe following recommendations deal only with configurational specification for the C60-Ih and\\nC70-D5h(6) fullerenes and their derivatives. They are based on a publication by C. Thilgen, A. Herr-\\nmann, and F. Diederich [16]. \\nFu-17.1 Types of chiral fullerenes\\nFour types of chiral fullerenes and/or fullerene derivatives can be distinguished depending on the ori-\\ngin of their chirality. Although the discussion that follows concerns substituted fullerenes as described\\n© 2002 IUPAC, Pure and Applied Chemistry 74, 629–695\\nNomenclature for the C60-Ih and C70-D5h(6) fullerenes 683\\nll The CA index name is [5,6]fullerene-C60-Ih compd. with lanthanum (1:2).\\nin Fu-6.2, it applies equally well to heterofullerenes and isotopically substituted fullerenes and their\\nderivatives. Configurational specification for structurally modified fullerenes (fulleroids) is not dis-\\ncussed here; it will be considered in a later publication.\\nType 1. Inherently chiral parent fullerenes. Since the C60-Ih and C70-D5h(6) parent fullerenes are not\\ninherently chiral, they do not belong to this category. This type will only be illustrated here\\nand more fully discussed in a later publication.\\nType 2. Derivatives of achiral (and chiral) parent fullerenes in which the presence of substituents (see\\nFu-6.2), chiral or achiral, identical or different, on the fullerene skeleton, creates a chiral sub-\\nstitution pattern are said to have an inherently chiral substitution pattern.\\nType 3. Derivatives of achiral parent fullerenes in which a chiral substitution (see Fu-6.2) pattern on\\nthe fullerene is due only to nonidentities among the substituents are said to have a non-\\ninherently chiral substitution pattern.\\nType 4. Derivatives of achiral parent fullerenes in which the the presence of chiral substituents (see\\nFu-6.2) does not create a chiral substitution pattern have the stereogenic elements located\\nexclusively in the substituents.\\nFu-17.2 The substitution test\\nIt must be recognized that a fullerene compound can belong to more than one of the above types when\\ndifferent stereogenic elements are superimposed in the same molecule. The above types of chirality can\\nbe classified by the simple substitution test shown in Scheme 1. To be precise, the scheme can be\\nW. H. POWELL et al.\\n© 2002 IUPAC, Pure and Applied Chemistry 74, 629–695\\n684\\nScheme 1 Classification of fullerene chirality by a stepwise substitution pattern.\\napplied only to a single fullerene unit. In cases where there are more than one unit and more than one\\nare chiral, each unit gets its own descriptor.\\nThe substitution test consists of (a) replacing all substituents (see Fu-6.2) by the same achiral test\\nsubstituent; (b) replacing nonidentical substituents by nonidentical achiral test substituents; and (c)\\nconsideration of the original molecule. After each step, the resulting structure of increasing complexity\\nis checked for chirality; as soon as it is found, the type of chirality can be identified.\\nFu-17.3 Principles of the descriptor system\\nThe descriptor system presented herein is based on the fact that the numbering schemes proposed for\\nfullerenes in this documentmm are chiral (helical) and thus constitute an ideal reference for differenti-\\nating between enantiomers of chiral carbon cages and of fullerene derivatives having a chiral substitu-\\ntion pattern. A single descriptor is sufficient to specify the configuration of a chiral fullerene or of a chi-\\nral fullerene substitution pattern, regardless of the degree of its substitution or skeletal replacement. \\nIn a three-dimensional model, the pathway following the sequence of numbered carbon atoms\\nconsists of a helix, or of helical segments, and is therefore chiral. As a consequence, two isometric, mir-\\nror symmetric, numbering schemes can be applied to an achiral parent fullerene, as shown for \\n(C60-Ih)[5,6]fullerene in Fig. 6. The arrows indicate the direction of the numbering (see below); clock-\\nwise on the left and anticlockwise on the right looking from outside the cage.\\n© 2002 IUPAC, Pure and Applied Chemistry 74, 629–695\\nNomenclature for the C60-Ih and C70-D5h(6) fullerenes 685\\nmm Also applies to other numbering methods that are helical.\\nnn In this document, the convention for Schlegel diagrams is that the central polygon is considered to be closer to the viewer.\\nFig. 6 Three-dimensional and Schlegel diagramsnn of (C60-Ih)[5,6]fullerene with enantiomeric numberings.\\nOn the other hand, the numbering for a specific enantiomer of an inherently chiral fullerene is\\nunique, and its mirror image must be applied to the other optical antipode. This is shown in Fig. 7 for\\nthe chiral (C76-D2)[5,6]fullereneoo. Again, the arrows indicate the direction of the numbering. The 3-D\\ndiagrams are viewed down the axis chosen as the basis for numbering; the Schlegel drawings are viewed\\ndown one of the C2 axes.\\nBecause of the lack of mirror symmetry, each numbering fits only a single enantiomer. A descrip-\\ntion of the handedness of the numbering scheme used is sufficient to unambiguously characterize the\\nabsolute configuration of the fullerene. The viewer, looking at the polygon in which the numbering\\nstarts from outside the fullerene cage, traces a path from C-1 to C-2 to C-3, which are never aligned in\\na fullerene structure. If this path describes a clockwise direction, the configuration is indicated by the\\ndescriptor (f,xC)- qq, where the superscript ‘f’ indicates that the descriptor refers to a fullerene, and the\\nsuperscript ‘x’ is either ‘s’ for the systematic numbering described in Fu-3.2 or Fu-3.3 or ‘t’ for the triv-\\nW.

If the path from C-1 to C-2 to C-3 describes an anticlockwise direc-\\ntion, the descriptor is (f,xA)- rr. Thus, the enantiomer of (C76-D2)[5,6]fullerene shown in the upper half\\nof Fig. 7 is (f,sC)-(C76-D2)[5,6]fullerene and the enantiomer shown in the lower half of Fig. 7 is (f,sA)-\\n(C76-D2)[5,6]fullerene.\\nThis procedure is also valid for derivatives of inherently chiral fullerenes, because the numbering\\nscheme applies to the parent fullerene as well as to the derivative.\\nExamples:\\nI (f,sA)-2H-5-Aza-(C76-D2)[5,6]fullerene\\nII (f,sC)-20-tert-Butyl-20,21-dihydro(C76-D2)[5,6]fullerene\\nFu-17.4 Achiral parent fullerenes with an inherently chiral substitution pattern\\nThe fullerene compounds in this category are all substituted achiral fullerenes. They have an inherently\\nchiral substitution pattern if the existence of enantiomeric species is inherent to the geometric arrange-\\nment of the substitution sites on the fullerene parent regardless of whether the substituents are identical\\nor different. In these fullerene derivatives there is a unique numbering scheme that leads to the lowest\\nset of locants for the substituents. As above, a description of the handedness of the numbering scheme\\nthat leads to the lowest set of locants is sufficient to unambiguously characterize the absolute configu-\\nration of the substituted fullerene as f,xC or f,xA.\\n© 2002 IUPAC, Pure and Applied Chemistry 74, 629–695\\nNomenclature for the C60-Ih and C70-D5h(6) fullerenes 687\\nrr As is customary for stereodescriptors, parentheses are used as enclosing marks.\\nss This fullerene is numbered by the system used in CA index nomenclature which has not been accepted by IUPAC; a future\\nreport will deal with numbering of fullerenes other than (C60-Ih)[5,6]fullerene and (C70-D5h(6))[5,6]fullerene.\\nExample 1: 3′,3′-Diethyl 3′′,3′′,3′′′,3′′′-tetramethyl 3′H,3′′H,3′′′H-tricyclopropa[1,9:34,35:43,57]-\\n(C60-Ih)[5,6]fullerene-3′,3′,3′′,3′′,3′′′,3′′′-hexacarboxylate\\nExplanations: \\n(a) In the enantiomers of the (C60-Ih)[5,6]fullerene derivatives shown above, clockwise (I) and anti-\\nclockwise (II) numbering leads to the same lowest set of locants, namely, 1,9:34,35:43,57,\\nrespectively. Use of the enantiomeric numbering scheme for each, shown as III and IV, results in\\nthe locant set, 1,9:36,37:46,58, a higher locant set that is unacceptable according to the rule of\\nlowest locants in organic nomenclature [8c].\\n(b) The parent fullerene, (C60-Ih)[5,6]fullerene, is achiral but the compound is chiral by virtue of its\\nsubstitution pattern. This compound is inherently chiral because replacement of all of its sub-\\nstituents by the same achiral test substituent, ‘T’, still results in a chiral structure as shown below.\\nW. H.

The same set of lowest locants is\\nobtained with both mirror-symmetric numberings. In order to make a distinction a classification of sub-\\n© 2002 IUPAC, Pure and Applied Chemistry 74, 629–695\\nNomenclature for the C60-Ih and C70-D5h(6) fullerenes 689\\nstituents is necessary. This can be achieved in the most convenient way by using the CIP (Cahn-Ingold-\\nPrelog) method of ranking substituents by atom-by-atom exploration of each attached atom or group\\n[17]. For fullerenes with a noninherently chiral substitution pattern, each substituent is compared by\\nstarting the exploration process at the atom located in the fullerene skeleton and moving outward pro-\\ngressively until a priority difference is identifiedtt. Of the two mirror-symmetric numbering schemes\\nleading to the same lowest set of locants, the one assigning a lower locant to an atom or group of higher\\nCIP priority at the first point of difference is preferred and confers its descriptor to the enantiomer in\\nquestion.\\nA classification of substituents based on the principle of alphabetical order provides the same\\nstereodescriptor assignment for fullerenes with noninherently chiral substitution patterns in some cases\\n(see Example 1, below) but this is pure coincidence because the two methods are based on fundamen-\\ntally different principles. Furthermore, alphabetical order cannot be applied in all cases (see Example 2,\\nbelow) and therefore is not broadly applicable. \\nIn considering fullerenes with noninherently chiral substitution patterns, their names must be\\nbased on nomenclature principles, such as alphabetical order and lowest locants, but their stereo-\\ndescriptors are based on purely structural considerations for which the CIP method is clearly the method\\nof choice. \\nExample 1: 1-tert-Butyl-7-(3,6-dicyclopropylcyclohepta-2,4,6-trien-1-yl)-1,7-dihydro-\\n(C60-Ih)[5,6]fullerene\\nExplanation: This compound is chiral only because the substituents are constitutionally different.\\nThe parent fullerene is achiral and it does not have an inherently chiral substitution pattern\\nbecause replacement of both substituents by the same achiral test substituent, ‘T’, results in an\\nachiral compound. Therefore it has a noninherently chiral substitution pattern. The tert-butyl\\ngroup is assigned the locant ‘1’ because its CIP priority is higher than that of the 3,6-dicyclo-\\npropylcyclohepta-2,4,6-trien-1-yl group. For this example, using the nomenclature principle of\\nalphabetic order of substituents would give the same result, but this is purely coincidental because\\nthe two procedures are based on fundamentally different principles (see Example 2, below, for\\nwhich a different numbering is required in order to use the CIP priority method). \\nW. H. POWELL et al.\\n© 2002 IUPAC, Pure and Applied Chemistry 74, 629–695\\n690\\ntt In case two enantiomorphic substituted fullerenes would need to be compared according to the CIP exploration procedure, it is\\nsuggested that, in addition to the priority of R over S and of M over P in subrule 5 (17), f,,xC be given priority over f,,xA.\\nExample 2: 3′-Methylisoxazolo[4′,5′:7,22](C70-D5h(6))[5,6]fullerene\\nExplanations:\\n(a) This compound is chiral only because the fused ring is unsymmetrical. The parent fullerene is\\nachiral and it does not have an inherently chiral substitution pattern because replacement of both\\nsubstituents by the same achiral test substituent, ‘T’, results in an achiral compound. Therefore,\\nit has a noninherently chiral substitution pattern. \\n(b) In this example, the numbering used to name the compound is based on the nomenclature princi-\\nple of lowest set of locants [8c] for the fusion site and is not appropriate for assignment of the\\nstereodescriptor. The numbering scheme to be used for assignment of the stereodescriptor is cho-\\nsen so that the lower locant ‘7’ of the fullerene is associated with atom of highest priority in the\\nisoxazole ring, i.e., the ‘O’ atom. This numbering is shown in the structures below which would\\nlead to the incorrect name 3′-Methylisoxazolo[4′,5′:22,7](C70-D5h(6))[5,6]fullerene because its\\nlocants are higher that those in the name above. Therefore, the stereodescriptors for the enan-\\ntiomers shown above are (f,sC)- and (f,sA)-, respectively, as shown.\\nNote: It must be kept clearly in mind that the generation of the stereodescriptor is additional to\\nname formation. \\n© 2002 IUPAC, Pure and Applied Chemistry 74, 629–695\\nNomenclature for the C60-Ih and C70-D5h(6) fullerenes 691\\nExample 3: 3′,3′,3′′,3′′-Tetra-tert-butyl 3′′′,3′′′,3′′′ ′,3′′′ ′-tetraethyl 3′H,3′′H,3′′′H,3′′′ ′-tetracyclo-\\npropa[8,25:16,35:44,45:55,56](C70-D5h(6) )[5,6]fullerene-3′,3′,3′′,3′′,3′′′,3′′′,3′′′ ′,3′′′ ′-\\noctacarboxylate\\nExplanations: \\n(a) The parent fullerene for this compound is achiral and replacement of all substituents by the achi-\\nral test substituent ‘T’ (see I, below) still results in an achiral compound. \\n(b) Accordingly, the second step of the substitution test (see Scheme 1), i.e., replacement of the sub-\\nstituents by the achiral test substituents T1 and T2, which must respect the identities and non-\\nidentities of the original substituents, is applied (see II, above), resulting in a chiral structure\\nbecause T1 is different from T2. Hence, the compound has a noninherently chiral substitution pat-\\ntern. The fused cyclopropane rings carying the tert-butyl ester groups have the highest CIP prior-\\nity and are therefore assigned the lowest fusion locants.\\nW. H.

The parent fullerene is achiral and the derivative has an achiral\\nsubstitution pattern. Replacement of all substituents by the achiral test group T (see Scheme 1)\\nresults in an achiral structure; and since the original substituents were already identical the sec-\\nond step of the substitution test is not necessary. Step 3 of the substitution test (see Scheme 1)\\nasks if the original compound was chiral. The answer is yes, and thus the stereogenic units occur\\nonly in the groups attached to the fullerene core. The configuration of such stereogenic units can\\nbe described by the normal descriptors of organic nomenclature [18]. \\n(b) If the esters of the acid in the above example were different, the structure resulting from step 2 of\\nthe substitution test would have the achiral substituents T1 and T2; but the parent fullerene and it\\nsubstitution pattern would be achiral, and, therefore, any chirality of the original compound would\\nbe due to stereogenic centers located in the substituents.\\nFu-17. 7 Superimposition of stereogenic elements in a fullerene molecule\\nIf a fullerene derivative with an inherently or noninherently chiral substitution pattern carries chiral sub-\\nstituents, the configuration of both types of stereogenic elements has to be indicated.

This class was originally limited to closed-cage structures with 12 isolated five-membered rings, the rest being six-membered rings. Although it was recognized that existing organic ring nomenclature could be used for these structures, the resulting names would be extremely unwieldy and inconvenient for use. At the same time it was also recognized that established organic nomenclature principles could be used, or adapted, to provide a consistent nomenclature for this unique class of compounds based on the class name fullerene. However, it was necessary to develop an entirely new method for uniquely numbering closed-cage systems. This paper describes IUPAC recommendations for naming and uniquely numbering the two most common fullerenes with isolated pentagons, the icosahedral C60 fullerene and a D5h-C70 fullerene. It also describes recommendations for adapting organic nomenclature principles for naming fullerenes with nonclosed-cage structures, heterofullerenes, derivatives formed by substitution of hydrofullerenes, and the fusion of organic rings or ring systems to the fullerene cage. Finally, this paper suggests methods for describing structures consisting of two or more fullerene units and for denoting configurations of chiral fullerenes and their derivatives</dc:description><dc:identifier>\\n  http://doc.rero.ch/record/303076/files/pac200274040629.pdf</dc:identifier><dc:date>\\n  2017-08-02T19:48:04Z</dc:date>\\n</oai_dc:dc>\\n</metadata></record>',\n",

Total counts of aerobic bacteria and Enterobacteriaceae, as well as presence of Salmonella, with particular focus on the serotype Enteritidis, have been investigated on environmental swabs and dusts as well as on eggshells and on edible part of egg sampled at the hen age of 24, 48 and 72 weeks. The data were analysed by ANOVA using the GLM procedure of SAS (1989).\\n\\nThe rate of Salmonella positive samples observed among environmental swabs and dusts, faeces, eggshells and edible part of eggs collected in conventional cage and organic systems did not show any statistically significative difference. The samples more frequently contaminated by Salmonella have been environmental dusts in both organic and conventional houses (i.e. 11.1 and 6.6%) as well as on faeces (i.e. 9.5 and 8%). \\n\\nEggs with Salmonella positive eggshells were collected only within organic production units whereas their edible parts were Salmonella negative. This result demonstrated the inhibitory efficacy of antimicrobial enzymatic systems of the inner egg able to reduce the aerobic bacteria and Enterobacteriaceae which were always lower than the detection limits, corresponding to 10 and 1 colony forming unit (CFU) per g, respectively. \\n\\nOverall, total aerobic counts on both environmental samples and eggshells did not show a statistically significant increase over time. In fact, they ranged between 4.82 and 5.18 Log10 CFU/g and between 4.65 and 4.75 Log10 CFU/g within organic and conventional cage houses, respectively. The same trend has been observed for the Enterobacteriaceae total counts, ranging  between 1.83 and 1.92 Log10 CFU/g and between 2.16 and 2.43 Log10 CFU/g within organic and conventional cage houses, respectively. These values justify the low rate of Salmonella contamination and agree with those described in literature. The total aerobic counts on environmental dusts sampled within organic and conventional cage houses did not show any statistical differences, whereas the Enterobacteriaceae count on environmental dusts sampled within organic units has been statistically lower than that observed in conventional cage houses (i.e. 3.45 vs 5.19 Log10 CFU/g). On the contrary, the total aerobic and Enterobacteriaceae counts on eggshells of eggs collected within organic and conventional cage houses did not show any statistical difference. \\n\\nIn conclusion, from an environmental point of view, the overall microbial contamination is lower in the organic system, whereas the rate of Salmonella resulted higher in the eggshells of organic eggs.

A computational procedure is developed to predict the thermodynamically preferred product and the lowest energy conformer, hence rationalizing the observed alternation and the 3D cage structures, based on knowledge of the precursors alone. The field of porous materials is largely dominated byextended networks, such as zeolites,1 porous polymers,2 and metal−organic frameworks (MOFs).3 An alternative class of porous materials are discrete ‘porous molecules’,4,5 such as porous cages. Unlike networks, cage molecules assemble to form a molecular ‘pore ’ in solution, prior to assembling in the solid state.

INTRODUCTION\\nIn 1997, a preliminary survey of numbering and nomenclature for fullerenes prepared by a working\\ngroup appointed by the President of IUPAC, Alan Bard, was published [1]. It described two types of\\nnames for fullerenes, one proposed by some workers in the field and the one used by Chemical\\nAbstracts Service (CAS); and two systems for numbering fullerene skeletons, one proposed in a publi-\\ncation by R. Taylor [2] and one published by CAS [3]. In addition, alternative methods for naming\\nderivatives of fullerenes were discussed. However, no approved IUPAC recommendations were con-\\ntained in the IUPAC preliminary survey [1]. The present report contains approved IUPAC recommen-\\ndations for naming and numbering the C60-Ih and C70-D5h(6) fullerenes and their derivatives. It is lim-\\nited to these fullerenes because there are only a very small number of known derivatives of only a few\\nother fullerenes. Apart from the numbering and identification of other fullerenes with degenerate point\\ngroup symbols, which will require complex rules, the nomenclature for all fullerenes can be amply\\nillustrated by the derivatives of these two fullerenes. \\n© 2002 IUPAC, Pure and Applied Chemistry 74, 629–695\\nNomenclature for the C60-Ih and C70-D5h(6) fullerenes 631\\nFU-1. DEFINITIONS\\nFu-1.1 Fullerenes\\nThe classical definition of a fullerene is a compound composed solely of an even number of carbon\\natoms which form a cage-like fused-ring polycyclic system with 12 five-membered rings and the rest\\nsix-membered rings; the archetypal example is the 60-atom structure, where the atoms and bonds delin-\\neate a truncated icosahedron [4,5]. However, the term has been broadened to include any closed-cage\\nstructure having 20 or more carbon atoms consisting entirely of 3 coordinate carbon atoms [3].\\nFu-1.2 Fulleranes \\nFulleranes are fully saturated fullerenes, for example, the hydrocarbon C60H60.\\nFu-1.3 Fulleroids\\nHeterofullerenes, norfullerenes, homofullerenes, and secofullerenes have been called fulleroids\\n(fullerene-like) because they resemble fullerenes in structure but do not conform to the definition of a\\nfullerene as given above. It is convenient to refer to them as fulleroids and name them as modified\\nfullerenes.\\nFU-2. NAMES\\nFu-2.1 Systematic names\\nThe recommended systematic names for the icosahedral C60 and the D5h(6)-C70 fullerenes are \\n(C60-Ih)[5,6]fullerene and (C70-D5h(6))[5,6]fullerene. The parenthetical prefix gives the carbon content\\nand the point group symbol; and the bracketed numbers indicate the ring sizes in the fullerene. The lat-\\nter is important in fullerenes with rings other than five- and six-membered. The subscript parenthetical\\n(6) following the point group symbol D5h in the latter name indicates that the five-membered ring on\\nthe five-fold symmetry axis is surrounded by six-membered rings. This differentiates this fullerene from\\nan isomeric (C70-D5h)[5,6]fullerene, which has five-membered rings surrounding the five-membered\\nring on the five-fold symmetry axis, which would have the name (C70-D5h(5))[5,6]fullerene. This tech-\\nnique is being further evaluated to determine its value for differentiating among other fullerenes with\\ndegenerate point group symbols. The recommended names have the same information as the corre-\\nsponding CAS names, but in a different format.\\nFu-2.2 Trivial names\\nThe names [60-Ih]fullerene and [70-D5h]fullerene given in the IUPAC Preliminary Survey [1] are names\\nfirst introduced into the literature for the C60-Ih and C70-D5h(6) fullerenes. Since important structural\\ninformation is omitted from these names, they are to be considered as trivial names to be used only for\\nthese specific compounds. \\nFU-3. NUMBERING\\nFu-3.1 Systematic numbering\\nSystematic numbering for (C60-Ih)[5,6]fullerene and (C70-D5h(6))[5,6]fullerene is based on the follow-\\ning rules adapted from the CAS publication [3]. These rules are sufficient to systematically number\\n(C60-Ih)[5,6]fullerene and (C70-D5h(6))[5,6]fullerene. More rules are needed for other fullerenes. The\\nCAS rules [3] are being evaluated and, if found appropriate, will be included in a subsequent report.\\nW. H. POWELL et al.\\n© 2002 IUPAC, Pure and Applied Chemistry 74, 629–695\\n632\\nFu-3.1.1\\nProper rotation axes, (Cn), are examined in sequence, from the highest-order to the lowest-order axis,\\nuntil at least one contiguous spiral pathway is found that begins in a ring through which a proper rota-\\ntion axis passes, at the end of a bond bisected by a proper rotation axis, or at an atom through which a\\nproper rotation axis passes. Numbering begins at the end of such a contiguous spiral pathway. \\nFu-3.1.2\\nIf there is a choice for the selection of a reference axis or for the end of a reference axis to begin the\\nnumbering, a ring is preferred to a bond, which, in turn is preferred to an atom.\\nFu-3.1.2.1\\nWhen there is a choice between rings, a larger ring is preferred to a smaller one. Where there is still a\\nchoice, the preferred ring contains the preferred atom (see Fu-3.1.2.3) at the first point of difference. \\nFu-3.1.2.2\\nWhen there is a choice between bonds, the preferred bond is the common bond between the set of\\nlargest rings, for example, 66 > 65 > 55. Where there is still a choice, the preferred bond contains the\\npreferred atom (see Fu-3.1.2.3) at the first point of difference.\\nFu-3.1.2.3\\nWhen there is a choice among atoms, the preferred atom is the common atom in the set of largest rings,\\nfor example, 666 > 665 > 655 > 555.\\nFu-3.1.3\\nWhere there is a choice of spiral pathways for numbering, the preferred pathway terminates as close as\\npossible, in terms of the number of bonds, to the axis of the spiral. \\nFu-3.2 Systematic numbering for (C60-Ih)[5,6]fullerene \\nThis fullerene (see Fig. 1) has six equivalent C5 axes passing through opposite pentagons, each of which\\ngives identical contiguous spiral pathways in either direction from any atom of any pentagon. Thus,\\neach of these C5 axes can be the reference axis. According to Fu-3.1.1, it is not necessary to investigate\\nany of the ten equivalent C3 axes passing through opposite hexagons nor the 15 equivalent C2 axes pass-\\ning through opposite bonds, all of which give contiguous spiral pathways. The systematic numbering is\\ngiven in Fig. 1 in both 3-D and Schlegel format.a\\n© 2002 IUPAC, Pure and Applied Chemistry 74, 629–695\\nNomenclature for the C60-Ih and C70-D5h(6) fullerenes 633\\na In this document, the convention for Schlegel diagrams is that the central polygon is considered to be closer to the viewer.\\nb For clarity, double bonds are not shown in fullerene structures throughout this report.\\nFig. 1 Systematic numbering for (C60-Ih)[5,6]fullereneb.\\n3-D Representation            Schlegel Representationa\\nFu-3.3 Systematic numbering for (C70-D5h(6))[5,6]fullerene \\nThe principal axis for this fullerene (see Fig. 3) is the C5 axis through opposite pentagons. There are no\\ncontiguous spiral pathways from any atom in either pentagon and thus the C5 axis cannot be a reference\\naxis. Therefore, possible contiguous spiral pathways must be investigated from any of the five equiva-\\nlent C2 axes that pass through the center of a six-membered ring at one end and bisect the bond between\\nthe two six-membered rings at the other end (see Fig. 2a). Since, according to Fu-3.1.2, a ring is pre-\\nferred to a bond, the search for a contiguous spiral pathway must start in the six-membered ring. There\\nare twelve possible pathways, one in each direction, clockwise and anticlockwise from each atom of the\\nsix-membered ring. However, because of symmetry, atoms marked ‘a’ in Fig. 2a are equivalent, as are\\natoms marked ‘b’ Therefore, there are only three possible pathways to explore, i.e., ‘bab’, clockwise\\n(Fig. 2b); ‘abb’, clockwise (Fig. 2c); and ‘bba’, clockwise (Fig. 2d). The clockwise ‘bab’ pathway (Fig.\\n2b) terminates at atom ‘c’ at the end of the bond bisected by the reference axis. The clockwise ‘abb’\\npathway (Fig. 2c) and the clockwise ‘bba’ pathway (Fig. 2d) terminate at ‘c′’, an atom at the end of a\\nbond one removed from the bond bisected by the reference axis, and ‘c″’, an atom at the end of a bond\\ntwo removed from the bond bisected by the reference axis, respectively. Thus, according to Fu-3.1.3,\\nthe preferred contiguous spiral pathway for numbering is the clockwise ‘bab’ pathway (Fig. 2b) and\\nthus the systematic numbering for (C70-D5h(6))[5,6]fullerene is that shown in Fig. 3.\\nW.

POWELL et al.\\n© 2002 IUPAC, Pure and Applied Chemistry 74, 629–695\\n634\\nFig. 2 Procedural drawings for numbering (C70-D5h(6))[5,6]fullerene.\\nFu-3.4 Trivial numbering\\nThis numbering, shown in Figs. 4 and 5, is to be used when the trivial names [60-Ih]fullerene and\\n[70-D5h]fullerene given in Fu-2.2 are used; they are based on the reported ‘most reactive bond’ [2]. \\nNote: Such a criterion does not lend itself to the establishment of a systematic method for num-\\nbering other fullerenes, especially ones that haven’t yet been characterized.\\nFU-4. STRUCTURALLY MODIFIED FULLERENES\\nModification of fullerene structures by the addition or deletion of atoms, or by the breaking or forma-\\ntion of bonds is described by the prefixes ‘homo’, ‘nor’, ‘seco’, and ‘cyclo’ in a manner similar to their\\nuse in organic stereoparent nomenclature, including their combinations [6].\\nFu-4.1 Homofullerenes\\nThe replacement of a carbon–carbon bond of a fullerene by a methylene group is described by attach-\\ning the nondetachable prefix ‘homo’ to the name of the parent fullerene. The original numbering of the\\nparent fullerene is retained. The location of the homo operation is described by a complex locant formed\\naccording to the method devised for insertion of a methylene group into a bond sector of a stereoparent\\n[6]. The complex locant is formed by adding the letters ‘a’, ‘b’, etc. to the pair of locants for the\\nreplaced bond which are the lowest locants consistent with the numbering of the fullerene, and enclos-\\ning the higher number in parentheses, for example, ‘1(9)a’; such complex locants must be used in par-\\nent names, but where there is no ambiguity, simple locants formed by adding the letter ‘a’ to the lower\\nlocant, such as ‘1a’ for the case above, may be used in structural formulas and for citation of sub-\\nstituents, etc.\\n© 2002 IUPAC, Pure and Applied Chemistry 74, 629–695\\nNomenclature for the C60-Ih and C70-D5h(6) fullerenes 635\\n3-D Representation                             Schlegel Representationc\\n(viewed along the C5 axis)\\nFig. 3 Systematic numbering for (C70-D5h(6))[5,6]fullerened.\\nc In this document, the convention for Schlegel diagrams is that the central polygon is considered to be closer to the viewer.\\nd For clarity, double bonds are not shown in fullerene structures throughout this report.\\nBecause of the possibility of rearrangement of the double bonds in homofullerene structures, indi-\\ncated hydrogen is used to designate the ‘extra’ hydrogen on the homo atom, even for di-, tri-, tetra-, etc.\\nhomofullerenes that could be considered to be hydro derivatives of fully unsaturated structures (see\\nExamples II and III, below).\\nNote: A complex locant format is used by CAS [3] in which the higher-numbered locant and the\\nletter ‘a’ are enclosed in parentheses following the locants of the replaced bond, as 1,2(2a); the\\ncorresponding simple locant for the added methylene group would be 2a.

As a result, the connectivity of remaining atoms may be reduced from three to two, which\\nrequires the presence of hydrogen atoms. An even number of hydrogen atoms is implied by the name;\\nif there is an odd number, one is expressed as indicated hydrogen because one carbon atom has changed\\nfrom sp2 to sp3 hybridization. A connectivity of three may also be satisfied by a heteroatom, such as\\n© 2002 IUPAC, Pure and Applied Chemistry 74, 629–695\\nNomenclature for the C60-Ih and C70-D5h(6) fullerenes 637\\nnitrogen or boron and a connectivity of two by a heteroatom such as oxygen or sulfur. Where there is a\\nchoice, locants for the atoms removed and indicated hydrogen are as low as possible.\\nNote 1: In organic stereoparent nomenclature atoms removed by the ‘nor’ operation are those hav-\\ning the highest possible number of the ring or chain segment [6].\\nNote 2: The main problem with the ‘nor’ operation is the limit to the number of carbon atoms that\\ncan be removed from a particular fullerene structure. Eventually, systematic ring nomenclature\\nwill provide a name that may be easier to understand than a polynorfullerene name. It would not\\nbe helpful to set a precise number of carbon atoms that can be removed by the nor operation; a\\nrealistic figure would depend a lot on whether blocks of carbon atoms or isolated carbon atoms\\nare being removed. For CAS, more than 20 % of the carbon atoms of a fullerene cannot be\\nremoved by the nor operation unless it can be shown to be a special situation. For (C60-Ih)[5,6]-\\nfullerene and (C70-D5h(6))[5,6]fullerene it is recommended that at least two ‘belts’ of rings or at\\nleast one-half of the atoms of the parent fullerene must remain intact after the ‘nor’ operation.\\nExamples:\\nI 2H-1-Nor(C60-Ih)[5,6]fullerene\\nII 1,9-Dinor(C60-Ih)[5,6]fullerene\\nIII 6H-1,2,3,4,5-Pentanor(C60-Ih)[5,6]fullerene \\nIV 8,23,24,25-Tetranor(C70-D5h(6))[5,6]fullerene\\nW.

FULLERENE DERIVATIVES \\nFu-6.1 Fulleranes\\nFulleranes are fully saturated fullerenes, i.e., CnHn, and their derivatives, radicals, and ions, can be\\nnamed by application of the principles of substitutive nomenclature normal to saturated hydrocarbons.\\nExamples:\\nI (C60-Ih)[5,6]Fulleran-1-yl                 IV (C60-Ih)[5,6]Fulleran-1-ide \\nII (C60-Ih)[5,6]Fulleran-1-ylium           V (C60-Ih)[5,6]Fulleran-9-id-1-yl\\nIII (C60-Ih)[5,6]Fulleran-9-ylium-1-yl    VI (C60-Ih)[5,6]Fulleran-1-ol\\nFu-6.2 Fullerenes\\nFullerenes however, do not have hydrogen atoms for direct substitution and thus their derivatives, rad-\\nicals, and ions, are named by application of the principles of substitutive nomenclature applicable to\\nfusion atoms of fused ring systems, for example, the 4a and 8a positions of naphthalene. The charac-\\nteristic group names and substituent prefix names normal to substitutive nomenclature are used.\\nNote: The lack of hydrogen atoms for substitution in fullerenes led to the conclusion in the pre-\\nliminary survey [1] that atoms and groups attached to fullerenes should be designated as addends\\nand not substituents. This would imply that principles of additive nomenclature should be used\\nwhich might lead to names such as dibromo[60-Ih]fullerene. However, this leads to difficulties\\nsince such names are, in fact, formed by coordination nomenclature (bromo is the current ligand\\nname for Br), a nomenclature method not approved for use with carbon compounds; the additive\\noperation in the nomenclature of organic compounds would produce names such as [60-Ih]fullerene\\ndibromide, for C60Br2. Since such additive names have been discarded in the nomenclature of\\norganic compounds, where substitutive names are preferred, the only acceptable method is to use\\nsubstitutive nomenclature, in which atoms and groups cited as prefixes substitute hydrogen atoms\\npreviously added by means of the additive prefix ‘hydro’; or groups cited as suffixes require the\\nconcomitant addition of hydrogen atoms cited as ‘added hydrogen’. Thus, names such as \\n1,9-dibromo-1,9-dihydro(C60-Ih)[5,6]fullerene and (C60-Ih)[5,6]fulleren-1(9H)-ol result, names\\nthat are fully in accordance with the principles, rules, and conventions of substitutive nomencla-\\nture. This approach provides a completely consistent method for naming fullerenes with atoms or\\ngroups attached to skeletal carbon atoms and all compounds derived from them.\\nW. H.

FULLERENES AND MODIFIED FULLERENES FUSED TO ORGANIC RINGS OR\\nRING SYSTEMS\\nFullerenes that share an adjacent pair of atoms with an organic ring or ring system are named by adapt-\\ning and extending the principles of fusion nomenclature [9]. As in normal organic fused ring systems,\\nthe pair of atoms shared by the fullerene and the organic ring or ring system is regarded as part of both\\ncomponents. However, unlike organic fused ring systems, each component retains its own bonding pat-\\ntern and numbering. Because of the nature of bonding in fullerenes, the fusion bond is always a single\\nbond and the fusion atoms cannot accept an ‘exo’ double bond. After fusion, nonfullerene components\\nother than alicyclic bi- and polycyclic ring systems have the maximum number of double bonds and\\nindicated hydrogen is cited as needed.\\nNote: Although when the nonfullerene component is a simple ring, such as cyclopropane or\\noxirene, the additional atoms could be cited by means of bridge prefixes, such as methano and\\nepoxy, for consistency it is recommended that all be named as fused systems. Both methods were\\nincluded in the preliminary survey [1]. It is clear that as the attached organic system becomes\\nmore complex, the formation of bridge names becomes more difficult. For example, the CAS\\nRing Systems Handbook [10] contains many examples of a fullerene fused to two organic rings\\nwhich themselves are connected by a bridge. For bridged fullerenes, see Fu-8.\\nOrganic rings and ring systems, including monocyclic rings and all polycyclic ring systems\\nexcept spiro ring systems, are always cited as prefixes to the name of the fullerene or modified fullerene.\\nSpiro systems that might be considered as fused to a fullerene are treated as spiro systems between\\nmodified fullerenes or fused fullerene systems and other components (see Fu-9). Each system retains\\nits own name and numbering both for indicating fusion sites and for indicating positions of substitution.\\nThe fullerene locants are always unprimed and primes are added to the locants of the fused organic rings\\nin the order described below. The fusion is described by citing the primed locants of the organic ring\\nW. H. POWELL et al.\\n© 2002 IUPAC, Pure and Applied Chemistry 74, 629–695\\n652\\ncomponent and the unprimed locants of the fullerene in that order, enclosed in brackets and separated\\nby a colon. Locants for monocyclic hydrocarbon components are usually omitted.\\nNote: CAS prefixes the fullerene name to that of a heterocyclic ring system when the latter has a\\nheteroatomic component preferred to the fullerene component [3]. For example, a fullerene com-\\nponent with no heteroatoms would be prefixed to any heterocyclic component, but a nitrogenous\\nheterocyclic component would be prefixed to an nitrogenous fullerene component. This method\\nwas chosen for consistency with normal organic fusion nomenclature where heterocycles are pre-\\nferred as base components. When the heterocycle is a monocycle, a fused ring system used as a\\nbase component in ordinary fusion nomenclature, or a heterocyclic ring system that is bridged,\\nthe fusion site is described by citing the unprimed locants of the fullerene component followed\\nby the letter locant for the fusion side of the heterocycle. However, when the heterocycle is itself\\na fused ring system, a bridged fused system that is not a base component, or a bridged nonfused\\nheterocycle, the fusion locants of the fullerene component are primed and those of the heterocy-\\ncle are unprimed. As a result in the latter case, the fusion locants are not the same as the locants\\nused for substitution, which are unprimed for the fullerene component and primed for the non-\\nfullerene component, a situation that could be confusing. This situation is defended by the notion\\nthat locants within brackets in fusion names are those of the components, and are not the locants\\nof the complete fused system.

CONFIGURATIONAL SPECIFICATION FOR THE C60-Ih AND C70-D5h(6)\\nFULLERENES AND THEIR DERIVATIVES\\nThe following recommendations deal only with configurational specification for the C60-Ih and\\nC70-D5h(6) fullerenes and their derivatives. They are based on a publication by C. Thilgen, A. Herr-\\nmann, and F. Diederich [16]. \\nFu-17.1 Types of chiral fullerenes\\nFour types of chiral fullerenes and/or fullerene derivatives can be distinguished depending on the ori-\\ngin of their chirality. Although the discussion that follows concerns substituted fullerenes as described\\n© 2002 IUPAC, Pure and Applied Chemistry 74, 629–695\\nNomenclature for the C60-Ih and C70-D5h(6) fullerenes 683\\nll The CA index name is [5,6]fullerene-C60-Ih compd. with lanthanum (1:2).\\nin Fu-6.2, it applies equally well to heterofullerenes and isotopically substituted fullerenes and their\\nderivatives. Configurational specification for structurally modified fullerenes (fulleroids) is not dis-\\ncussed here; it will be considered in a later publication.\\nType 1. Inherently chiral parent fullerenes. Since the C60-Ih and C70-D5h(6) parent fullerenes are not\\ninherently chiral, they do not belong to this category. This type will only be illustrated here\\nand more fully discussed in a later publication.\\nType 2. Derivatives of achiral (and chiral) parent fullerenes in which the presence of substituents (see\\nFu-6.2), chiral or achiral, identical or different, on the fullerene skeleton, creates a chiral sub-\\nstitution pattern are said to have an inherently chiral substitution pattern.\\nType 3. Derivatives of achiral parent fullerenes in which a chiral substitution (see Fu-6.2) pattern on\\nthe fullerene is due only to nonidentities among the substituents are said to have a non-\\ninherently chiral substitution pattern.\\nType 4. Derivatives of achiral parent fullerenes in which the the presence of chiral substituents (see\\nFu-6.2) does not create a chiral substitution pattern have the stereogenic elements located\\nexclusively in the substituents.\\nFu-17.2 The substitution test\\nIt must be recognized that a fullerene compound can belong to more than one of the above types when\\ndifferent stereogenic elements are superimposed in the same molecule. The above types of chirality can\\nbe classified by the simple substitution test shown in Scheme 1. To be precise, the scheme can be\\nW. H. POWELL et al.\\n© 2002 IUPAC, Pure and Applied Chemistry 74, 629–695\\n684\\nScheme 1 Classification of fullerene chirality by a stepwise substitution pattern.\\napplied only to a single fullerene unit. In cases where there are more than one unit and more than one\\nare chiral, each unit gets its own descriptor.\\nThe substitution test consists of (a) replacing all substituents (see Fu-6.2) by the same achiral test\\nsubstituent; (b) replacing nonidentical substituents by nonidentical achiral test substituents; and (c)\\nconsideration of the original molecule. After each step, the resulting structure of increasing complexity\\nis checked for chirality; as soon as it is found, the type of chirality can be identified.\\nFu-17.3 Principles of the descriptor system\\nThe descriptor system presented herein is based on the fact that the numbering schemes proposed for\\nfullerenes in this documentmm are chiral (helical) and thus constitute an ideal reference for differenti-\\nating between enantiomers of chiral carbon cages and of fullerene derivatives having a chiral substitu-\\ntion pattern. A single descriptor is sufficient to specify the configuration of a chiral fullerene or of a chi-\\nral fullerene substitution pattern, regardless of the degree of its substitution or skeletal replacement. \\nIn a three-dimensional model, the pathway following the sequence of numbered carbon atoms\\nconsists of a helix, or of helical segments, and is therefore chiral. As a consequence, two isometric, mir-\\nror symmetric, numbering schemes can be applied to an achiral parent fullerene, as shown for \\n(C60-Ih)[5,6]fullerene in Fig. 6. The arrows indicate the direction of the numbering (see below); clock-\\nwise on the left and anticlockwise on the right looking from outside the cage.\\n© 2002 IUPAC, Pure and Applied Chemistry 74, 629–695\\nNomenclature for the C60-Ih and C70-D5h(6) fullerenes 685\\nmm Also applies to other numbering methods that are helical.\\nnn In this document, the convention for Schlegel diagrams is that the central polygon is considered to be closer to the viewer.\\nFig. 6 Three-dimensional and Schlegel diagramsnn of (C60-Ih)[5,6]fullerene with enantiomeric numberings.\\nOn the other hand, the numbering for a specific enantiomer of an inherently chiral fullerene is\\nunique, and its mirror image must be applied to the other optical antipode. This is shown in Fig. 7 for\\nthe chiral (C76-D2)[5,6]fullereneoo. Again, the arrows indicate the direction of the numbering. The 3-D\\ndiagrams are viewed down the axis chosen as the basis for numbering; the Schlegel drawings are viewed\\ndown one of the C2 axes.\\nBecause of the lack of mirror symmetry, each numbering fits only a single enantiomer. A descrip-\\ntion of the handedness of the numbering scheme used is sufficient to unambiguously characterize the\\nabsolute configuration of the fullerene. The viewer, looking at the polygon in which the numbering\\nstarts from outside the fullerene cage, traces a path from C-1 to C-2 to C-3, which are never aligned in\\na fullerene structure. If this path describes a clockwise direction, the configuration is indicated by the\\ndescriptor (f,xC)- qq, where the superscript ‘f’ indicates that the descriptor refers to a fullerene, and the\\nsuperscript ‘x’ is either ‘s’ for the systematic numbering described in Fu-3.2 or Fu-3.3 or ‘t’ for the triv-\\nW.

If the path from C-1 to C-2 to C-3 describes an anticlockwise direc-\\ntion, the descriptor is (f,xA)- rr. Thus, the enantiomer of (C76-D2)[5,6]fullerene shown in the upper half\\nof Fig. 7 is (f,sC)-(C76-D2)[5,6]fullerene and the enantiomer shown in the lower half of Fig. 7 is (f,sA)-\\n(C76-D2)[5,6]fullerene.\\nThis procedure is also valid for derivatives of inherently chiral fullerenes, because the numbering\\nscheme applies to the parent fullerene as well as to the derivative.\\nExamples:\\nI (f,sA)-2H-5-Aza-(C76-D2)[5,6]fullerene\\nII (f,sC)-20-tert-Butyl-20,21-dihydro(C76-D2)[5,6]fullerene\\nFu-17.4 Achiral parent fullerenes with an inherently chiral substitution pattern\\nThe fullerene compounds in this category are all substituted achiral fullerenes. They have an inherently\\nchiral substitution pattern if the existence of enantiomeric species is inherent to the geometric arrange-\\nment of the substitution sites on the fullerene parent regardless of whether the substituents are identical\\nor different. In these fullerene derivatives there is a unique numbering scheme that leads to the lowest\\nset of locants for the substituents. As above, a description of the handedness of the numbering scheme\\nthat leads to the lowest set of locants is sufficient to unambiguously characterize the absolute configu-\\nration of the substituted fullerene as f,xC or f,xA.\\n© 2002 IUPAC, Pure and Applied Chemistry 74, 629–695\\nNomenclature for the C60-Ih and C70-D5h(6) fullerenes 687\\nrr As is customary for stereodescriptors, parentheses are used as enclosing marks.\\nss This fullerene is numbered by the system used in CA index nomenclature which has not been accepted by IUPAC; a future\\nreport will deal with numbering of fullerenes other than (C60-Ih)[5,6]fullerene and (C70-D5h(6))[5,6]fullerene.\\nExample 1: 3′,3′-Diethyl 3′′,3′′,3′′′,3′′′-tetramethyl 3′H,3′′H,3′′′H-tricyclopropa[1,9:34,35:43,57]-\\n(C60-Ih)[5,6]fullerene-3′,3′,3′′,3′′,3′′′,3′′′-hexacarboxylate\\nExplanations: \\n(a) In the enantiomers of the (C60-Ih)[5,6]fullerene derivatives shown above, clockwise (I) and anti-\\nclockwise (II) numbering leads to the same lowest set of locants, namely, 1,9:34,35:43,57,\\nrespectively. Use of the enantiomeric numbering scheme for each, shown as III and IV, results in\\nthe locant set, 1,9:36,37:46,58, a higher locant set that is unacceptable according to the rule of\\nlowest locants in organic nomenclature [8c].\\n(b) The parent fullerene, (C60-Ih)[5,6]fullerene, is achiral but the compound is chiral by virtue of its\\nsubstitution pattern. This compound is inherently chiral because replacement of all of its sub-\\nstituents by the same achiral test substituent, ‘T’, still results in a chiral structure as shown below.\\nW. H.

The same set of lowest locants is\\nobtained with both mirror-symmetric numberings. In order to make a distinction a classification of sub-\\n© 2002 IUPAC, Pure and Applied Chemistry 74, 629–695\\nNomenclature for the C60-Ih and C70-D5h(6) fullerenes 689\\nstituents is necessary. This can be achieved in the most convenient way by using the CIP (Cahn-Ingold-\\nPrelog) method of ranking substituents by atom-by-atom exploration of each attached atom or group\\n[17]. For fullerenes with a noninherently chiral substitution pattern, each substituent is compared by\\nstarting the exploration process at the atom located in the fullerene skeleton and moving outward pro-\\ngressively until a priority difference is identifiedtt. Of the two mirror-symmetric numbering schemes\\nleading to the same lowest set of locants, the one assigning a lower locant to an atom or group of higher\\nCIP priority at the first point of difference is preferred and confers its descriptor to the enantiomer in\\nquestion.\\nA classification of substituents based on the principle of alphabetical order provides the same\\nstereodescriptor assignment for fullerenes with noninherently chiral substitution patterns in some cases\\n(see Example 1, below) but this is pure coincidence because the two methods are based on fundamen-\\ntally different principles. Furthermore, alphabetical order cannot be applied in all cases (see Example 2,\\nbelow) and therefore is not broadly applicable. \\nIn considering fullerenes with noninherently chiral substitution patterns, their names must be\\nbased on nomenclature principles, such as alphabetical order and lowest locants, but their stereo-\\ndescriptors are based on purely structural considerations for which the CIP method is clearly the method\\nof choice. \\nExample 1: 1-tert-Butyl-7-(3,6-dicyclopropylcyclohepta-2,4,6-trien-1-yl)-1,7-dihydro-\\n(C60-Ih)[5,6]fullerene\\nExplanation: This compound is chiral only because the substituents are constitutionally different.\\nThe parent fullerene is achiral and it does not have an inherently chiral substitution pattern\\nbecause replacement of both substituents by the same achiral test substituent, ‘T’, results in an\\nachiral compound. Therefore it has a noninherently chiral substitution pattern. The tert-butyl\\ngroup is assigned the locant ‘1’ because its CIP priority is higher than that of the 3,6-dicyclo-\\npropylcyclohepta-2,4,6-trien-1-yl group. For this example, using the nomenclature principle of\\nalphabetic order of substituents would give the same result, but this is purely coincidental because\\nthe two procedures are based on fundamentally different principles (see Example 2, below, for\\nwhich a different numbering is required in order to use the CIP priority method). \\nW. H. POWELL et al.\\n© 2002 IUPAC, Pure and Applied Chemistry 74, 629–695\\n690\\ntt In case two enantiomorphic substituted fullerenes would need to be compared according to the CIP exploration procedure, it is\\nsuggested that, in addition to the priority of R over S and of M over P in subrule 5 (17), f,,xC be given priority over f,,xA.\\nExample 2: 3′-Methylisoxazolo[4′,5′:7,22](C70-D5h(6))[5,6]fullerene\\nExplanations:\\n(a) This compound is chiral only because the fused ring is unsymmetrical. The parent fullerene is\\nachiral and it does not have an inherently chiral substitution pattern because replacement of both\\nsubstituents by the same achiral test substituent, ‘T’, results in an achiral compound. Therefore,\\nit has a noninherently chiral substitution pattern. \\n(b) In this example, the numbering used to name the compound is based on the nomenclature princi-\\nple of lowest set of locants [8c] for the fusion site and is not appropriate for assignment of the\\nstereodescriptor. The numbering scheme to be used for assignment of the stereodescriptor is cho-\\nsen so that the lower locant ‘7’ of the fullerene is associated with atom of highest priority in the\\nisoxazole ring, i.e., the ‘O’ atom. This numbering is shown in the structures below which would\\nlead to the incorrect name 3′-Methylisoxazolo[4′,5′:22,7](C70-D5h(6))[5,6]fullerene because its\\nlocants are higher that those in the name above. Therefore, the stereodescriptors for the enan-\\ntiomers shown above are (f,sC)- and (f,sA)-, respectively, as shown.\\nNote: It must be kept clearly in mind that the generation of the stereodescriptor is additional to\\nname formation. \\n© 2002 IUPAC, Pure and Applied Chemistry 74, 629–695\\nNomenclature for the C60-Ih and C70-D5h(6) fullerenes 691\\nExample 3: 3′,3′,3′′,3′′-Tetra-tert-butyl 3′′′,3′′′,3′′′ ′,3′′′ ′-tetraethyl 3′H,3′′H,3′′′H,3′′′ ′-tetracyclo-\\npropa[8,25:16,35:44,45:55,56](C70-D5h(6) )[5,6]fullerene-3′,3′,3′′,3′′,3′′′,3′′′,3′′′ ′,3′′′ ′-\\noctacarboxylate\\nExplanations: \\n(a) The parent fullerene for this compound is achiral and replacement of all substituents by the achi-\\nral test substituent ‘T’ (see I, below) still results in an achiral compound. \\n(b) Accordingly, the second step of the substitution test (see Scheme 1), i.e., replacement of the sub-\\nstituents by the achiral test substituents T1 and T2, which must respect the identities and non-\\nidentities of the original substituents, is applied (see II, above), resulting in a chiral structure\\nbecause T1 is different from T2. Hence, the compound has a noninherently chiral substitution pat-\\ntern. The fused cyclopropane rings carying the tert-butyl ester groups have the highest CIP prior-\\nity and are therefore assigned the lowest fusion locants.\\nW. H.

The parent fullerene is achiral and the derivative has an achiral\\nsubstitution pattern. Replacement of all substituents by the achiral test group T (see Scheme 1)\\nresults in an achiral structure; and since the original substituents were already identical the sec-\\nond step of the substitution test is not necessary. Step 3 of the substitution test (see Scheme 1)\\nasks if the original compound was chiral. The answer is yes, and thus the stereogenic units occur\\nonly in the groups attached to the fullerene core. The configuration of such stereogenic units can\\nbe described by the normal descriptors of organic nomenclature [18]. \\n(b) If the esters of the acid in the above example were different, the structure resulting from step 2 of\\nthe substitution test would have the achiral substituents T1 and T2; but the parent fullerene and it\\nsubstitution pattern would be achiral, and, therefore, any chirality of the original compound would\\nbe due to stereogenic centers located in the substituents.\\nFu-17. 7 Superimposition of stereogenic elements in a fullerene molecule\\nIf a fullerene derivative with an inherently or noninherently chiral substitution pattern carries chiral sub-\\nstituents, the configuration of both types of stereogenic elements has to be indicated.

This class was originally limited to closed-cage structures with 12 isolated five-membered rings, the rest being six-membered rings,Although it was recognized that existing organic ring nomenclature could be used for these structures. the resulting names Would be extremely unwieldy and inconvient for use. At the same time it was also recognized that established organic nomenclature principles could be used. or adapted. to provide a consistent nomenclature for this unique class of compounds based on the class name fullerene. However. it was necessary to develop an entirely new method for uniquely, numbering closed-cage systems.This paper describes IUPAC recommendations for naming and uniquely numbering the two most common fullerenes with isolated pentagons, the icosahedral C-60 fullerene and a D-5h-C-70 fullerene. It also describes recommendations for adapting organic nomenclature principles for naming fullerenes with nonclosed-cage structures, heterofullerenes, derivatives formed by Substitution of hydrofullerenes, and the fusion of organic rings or ring systems to the fullerene cage. Finally, this paper suggests methods for describing Structures consisting of two or more fullerene units and for denoting configurations of chiral fullerenes and their derivatives.</dc:description><dc:language>[[iso]]en</dc:language><dc:publisher>International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry</dc:publisher><dc:relation>Pure and Applied Chemistry, International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry, Volume 74, Issue 4, 2002, Pages 629-695</dc:relation><dc:subject>Fullerenes</dc:subject><dc:subject>allotrope</dc:subject><dc:subject>closed-cage</dc:subject><dc:subject>nomenclature</dc:subject><dc:subject>IUPAC</dc:subject><dc:title>Nomenclature for the C60-Ih and C70-D5h(6) fullerenes</dc:title><dc:type>article</dc:type><dc:identifier>[[volume]]74</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>[[issue]]4</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>[[journaltitle]]Pure and Applied Chemistry</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>[[firstpage]]629</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>[[lastpage]]695</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>[[doi]]10.1351/pac200274040629</dc:identifier><dc:description>[[fileno]]2010332010005</dc:description><dc:description>[[department]]化學系</dc:description><dc:identifier>[[uri]]http://nthur.lib.nthu.edu.tw/dspace/handle/987654321/56733</dc:identifier><dc:subject>[[classification]]31</dc:subject></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>',\n",

       "    'description': 'Biological systems have the incredible ability to accomplish uncommon chemical transformations with supreme delicacy. Many of those chemical transformations take place within the pocket of enzymes, which provide unique micro environment. From the quest of better understanding and to mimic such complex biological systems chemists have developed their own prototypes having well-defined cavity. To this end, in last few years many aesthetically elegant 3D discrete architectures have been devised by employing noncovalent interactions especially metal-ligand co-ordination and hydrogen bonding. Conversely, architectures based on purely covalent interactions are relatively limited in number, owing to the laborious traditional covalent synthesis, which involves multi-step synthetic protocols and irreversible covalent bond formations. Nevertheless, in recent times by utilizing dynamic covalent chemistry (DCC) several such organic 3D discrete ensembles have been developed with ease and efficiency from simple and easily accessible building blocks. Interestingly in most of such cases imine condensation reaction has been utilized due to easy formation and cleavage of the imine bonds in an efficient and reversible manner. However, it is quite surprising that even though the dynamic nature of imine bonds has been well established; self-sorting/self-selection process has been overlooked in organic cage systems.\\n\\nSelf-sorting in biological realm is a well-established synthetic protocol. DNA double helix formation via hydrogen bonding between the complimentary base pairs is probably the best known example of biological self-sorting. Self-sorting process has the ability to discriminate self from non-self to achieve highly ordered architectures from within a random reaction mixture. The credit of self-sorting/self-selection process goes to the hidden ‘molecular instructions’ encrypted within the complimentary building blocks.\\n\\nThe foremost objective of the present thesis work is to implement the self-sorting/self-selection protocol in organic cage formation by harnessing the dynamic imine chemistry. During the course of the investigation it has been observed that non-covalent interaction especially hydrogen bonding could manipulate the outcome of such a process. Besides that,\\nselective formation of a single isomer of an organic cage from a reaction mixture of an unsymmetrical aldehyde and a flexible amine has been successfully achieved by simply fine tuning the geometric features (shape and size) of the reacting aldehyde.\\n\\nSuch three-dimensional cages are well appreciated by the scientific community owing to their potential applications in anion sensing, catalysis and gas storage/separation. However, they have not been explored as sensors for nitroaromatic explosives. Therefore, at this juncture several fluorescent organic cages have been synthesized and their potential application as chemosensor for the nitroaromatics has been tested. Moreover, a new synthetic protocol has been introduced for the post-synthetic modification of organic cages.\\n\\nChapter 1 covers a brief introduction about dynamic covalent chemistry with main emphasis on dynamic imine chemistry and its use in covalent cage synthesis. Moreover, this chapter accounts the very recent applications of such cage compounds in various fields such as a pours material for gas storage/separation, a molecular host for the stabilization of reactive species and for the recognition of ions or molecules.\\n\\nChapter 2 describes first time ever achieved self-sorting process in three-dimensional purely organic cages. First of all, four different [3+2] cages were synthesized by treating two different triamines with two different dialdehydes separately, by employing dynamic imine chemistry. The formation of desired cages was ascertained by various spectroscopic techniques. When a mixture of all the four components (two aldehydes and two amines) was subjected to reaction, only two cages were found to form (Scheme 1) out of several equally probable possibilities, which suggest a high-fidelity self-recognition. The issue of partner preferences was further verified by transforming a non-self-sorted cage into a self-sorted cage by treating the former with appropriate triamine or dialdehyde. For an in-depth understanding on this subject, theoretical calculations (gas phase DFT) were carried out, which suggested that observed self-sorting is a thermodynamically governed process.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nScheme 1. Self-sorting in organic imine cages through partner preferences.\\n\\nChapter 3 focuses that supramolecular interaction especially hydrogen-boding could be a possible way to direct a self-sorting process operating in imine based organic cage systems. It is a well-accepted fact that in most of the cases self-sorting process operates owing to the difference in geometric features (shape and size) of the competing building blocks. Thus increasing similarity in geometric features would create the situation more complex. It is anticipated that in such circumstances H-bonding could have a decisive role in partner selection. In order to investigate this, four different dialdehydes (A, B, C and D) having similar geometric background were synthesized. These aldehydes upon treatment with flexible amine X were found to form three nanosocpic [3+2] organic cages (aldehyde C gave insoluble uncharacterized material). When a one-pot reaction of triamine X with mixture of all the four aldehydes was carried out, selective formation of cage B3X2 was observed (Scheme 2). Conversely, the same reaction in absence of aldehyde B resulted in the formation of mixture of products. Theoretical and experimental studies fully support the fact that the presence of hydroxyl moiety adjacent to the formyl group in aldehyde B has the key role in selective formation of cage B3X2 from a complex reaction mixture, in which there are numerous equally probable possibilities. Such remarkable selection was further examined by converting a non-hydroxy (non-preferred) cage into hydroxy cage B3X2 (preferred) by treating the former with aldehyde B. The role of the H-bond in self-sorting process of two \\ndialdehydes and two triamines has been established. Furthermore, the possibility of cage–to-\\n\\ncage transformation through imine bond metathesis has also been addressed.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nScheme 2. H-bond directed 15-fold (2+3) incomplete self-sorting in organic imine cages.\\n\\nChapter 4 presents the investigation on the formation of single isomeric species of a [3+2] oligoimine cage from a reaction mixture of an unsymmetrical dialdehyde and a flexible triamine. So far, most of the reported organic cages are derived by symmetric building units. Asymmetric building blocks for the construction of such organic architectures are not the desirable choices, as they could lead to form mixture of isomeric cages. However, the asymmetric building blocks might form selectively one isomer only under the thermodynamic bias, which prefers the formation of one isomer over the other (s). In order to understand the factors that can direct such a process, three asymmetric dialdehydes (A, B and\\n\\nC) were synthesized and their reaction with a flexible amine X was carried out. Experimental outcomes suggested a striking difference in the abilities of isomer selection between aldehydes A/B and C. In case of aldehyde A/B selective formation of one oligoimine cage was observed, whereas aldehyde C led to form two isomeric oligoimine cages (Scheme 3). Experimental and theoretical findings have pointed out that the geometric features (shape and size) of the aldehyde play a decisive role in such isomer selection process.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nScheme 3. Shape and size directed self-selection in organic imine cages.\\n\\nPart A of Chapter 5 describes the synthesis and characterization of a fluorescent organic cage compound and its application as a sensor for the detection of explosive picric acid (PA). Picric acid is known to be as explosive as trinitrotoluene (TNT) and one of the principle constituents of many unexplored landmines. Though there are several fluorescent polymers, metal-organic frameworks and small molecule based sensors have been devised in last few years but very little attention has been given towards selective and sensitive detection of picric acid.\\n\\nIn this context desired organic cage compound 4 was synthesized by employing imine condensation between 4,4\\uf0a2-diformyltriphenylamine (1) with 1,3,5-tris(aminomethyl)-2,4,6-trimethylbenzene (2) followed by reduction of the imine bonds (Scheme 4). This fluorescent nature of the cage in both the solid and solution has been utilized for the detection of nitroaromatic compounds (NACs). Among the various NACs tested it has been found that PA induces highest quenching of the initial fluorescence intensity of the cage solution. Furthermore, this cage has the ability to discriminate PA from other nitrophenolic compounds, such as 2,4-dinitrophenol (DNP) and 4-nitrophenol. In addition to solution phase detection cage 4 has also been successfully utilized for the solid phase detection of PA. The experimental results demonstrates that high sensitivity of the cage towards PA is attributed to the stronger ground state complex formation between the cage and PA as well as excitation\\n\\nv\\n \\nenergy transfer (EET) process from protonated cage to the picrate. This represents the first\\n\\nreport of a cage compound as a sensor for nitroaromatic compounds.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nScheme 4. Synthesis of a fluorescent organic cage for the selective detection of picric acid.\\n\\nPart B of Chapter 5 reports a new synthetic methodology to decorate covalent organic cages post-synthetically, based on one-pot copper(I) catalyzed A3 coupling. A3-coupling is a three-component reaction between formaldehyde, secondary amine and terminal alkyne. In the present study selected organic cage 4 is furnished with six secondary amine moieties and thus it was allowed to react with 6 equiv. of formaldehyde and 6 equiv. of terminal alkyne in presence of CuI as a catalyst (Scheme 5).\\n\\nBy employing this synthetic strategy parent cage 4 has been modified to cages 5a-c with appendages phenyl-, xylyl- and napthyl-actylenes. The resulting decorated cages were characterized by multinuclear NMR (1H and 13C), MALDI-TOF and FTIR spectroscopy. All the post-synthetically decorated cages were found to be fluorescent in nature and thus in\\n\\nv\\norder to explore their potential use as a chemosensor for nitroaromatic compounds, cage 5a was tested. Experimental findings have suggested high selectivity of the cage towards nitroaromatic compounds. Interestingly, among the various nitroaromatics tested it has been observed that the cage is more sensitivity towards nitrophenolic compounds, whereas among the various nitrophenols tested, picric acid induced highest quenching.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nScheme 5.

These aldehydes upon treatment with \\nflexible amine X were found to form three nanosocpic [3+2] organic cages (aldehyde C gave \\ninsoluble uncharacterized material). When a one-pot reaction of triamine X with mixture of \\nall the four aldehydes was carried out, selective formation of cage B3X2 was observed \\n(Scheme 2). Conversely, the same reaction in absence of aldehyde B resulted in the \\nformation of mixture of products. Theoretical and experimental studies fully support the fact \\nthat the presence of hydroxyl moiety adjacent to the formyl group in aldehyde B has the key \\nrole in selective formation of cage B3X2 from a complex reaction mixture, in which there are \\nnumerous equally probable possibilities. Such remarkable selection was further examined by \\nconverting a non-hydroxy (non-preferred) cage into hydroxy cage B3X2 (preferred) by \\ntreating the former with aldehyde B. The role of the H-bond in self-sorting process of two \\niv \\n \\ndialdehydes and two triamines has been established. Furthermore, the possibility of cage–to-\\ncage transformation through imine bond metathesis has also been addressed. \\n \\nScheme 2.

So far, most of the reported organic cages are derived by symmetric building units. \\nAsymmetric building blocks for the construction of such organic architectures are not the \\ndesirable choices, as they could lead to form mixture of isomeric cages. However, the \\nasymmetric building blocks might form selectively one isomer only under the \\nthermodynamic bias, which prefers the formation of one isomer over the other (s). In order to \\nunderstand the factors that can direct such a process, three asymmetric dialdehydes (A, B and \\nC) were synthesized and their reaction with a flexible amine X was carried out. Experimental \\noutcomes suggested a striking difference in the abilities of isomer selection between \\naldehydes A/B and C. In case of aldehyde A/B selective formation of one oligoimine cage \\nwas observed, whereas aldehyde C led to form two isomeric oligoimine cages (Scheme 3). \\nExperimental and theoretical findings have pointed out that the geometric features (shape and \\nsize) of the aldehyde play a decisive role in such isomer selection process. \\nv \\n \\n \\nScheme 3. Shape and size directed self-selection in organic imine cages. \\nPart A of Chapter 5 describes the synthesis and characterization of a fluorescent organic \\ncage compound and its application as a sensor for the detection of explosive picric acid (PA). \\nPicric acid is known to be as explosive as trinitrotoluene (TNT) and one of the principle \\nconstituents of many unexplored landmines. Though there are several fluorescent polymers, \\nmetal-organic frameworks and small molecule based sensors have been devised in last few \\nyears but very little attention has been given towards selective and sensitive detection of \\npicric acid. \\nIn this context desired organic cage compound 4 was synthesized by employing imine \\ncondensation between 4,4\\uf0a2-diformyltriphenylamine (1) with 1,3,5-tris(aminomethyl)-2,4,6-\\ntrimethylbenzene (2) followed by reduction of the imine bonds (Scheme 4). This fluorescent \\nnature of the cage in both the solid and solution has been utilized for the detection of \\nnitroaromatic compounds (NACs). Among the various NACs tested it has been found that \\nPA induces highest quenching of the initial fluorescence intensity of the cage solution. \\nFurthermore, this cage has the ability to discriminate PA from other nitrophenolic \\ncompounds, such as 2,4-dinitrophenol (DNP) and 4-nitrophenol. In addition to solution phase \\ndetection cage 4 has also been successfully utilized for the solid phase detection of PA. The \\nexperimental results demonstrates that high sensitivity of the cage towards PA is attributed to \\nthe stronger ground state complex formation between the cage and PA as well as excitation \\nvi \\n \\nenergy transfer (EET) process from protonated cage to the picrate.

Many of those chemical transformations take place within the pocket of enzymes, which provide unique micro environment. From the quest of better understanding and to mimic such complex biological systems chemists have developed their own prototypes having well-defined cavity. To this end, in last few years many aesthetically elegant 3D discrete architectures have been devised by employing noncovalent interactions especially metal-ligand co-ordination and hydrogen bonding. Conversely, architectures based on purely covalent interactions are relatively limited in number, owing to the laborious traditional covalent synthesis, which involves multi-step synthetic protocols and irreversible covalent bond formations. Nevertheless, in recent times by utilizing dynamic covalent chemistry (DCC) several such organic 3D discrete ensembles have been developed with ease and efficiency from simple and easily accessible building blocks. Interestingly in most of such cases imine condensation reaction has been utilized due to easy formation and cleavage of the imine bonds in an efficient and reversible manner. However, it is quite surprising that even though the dynamic nature of imine bonds has been well established; self-sorting/self-selection process has been overlooked in organic cage systems.\\n\\nSelf-sorting in biological realm is a well-established synthetic protocol. DNA double helix formation via hydrogen bonding between the complimentary base pairs is probably the best known example of biological self-sorting. Self-sorting process has the ability to discriminate self from non-self to achieve highly ordered architectures from within a random reaction mixture. The credit of self-sorting/self-selection process goes to the hidden ‘molecular instructions’ encrypted within the complimentary building blocks.\\n\\nThe foremost objective of the present thesis work is to implement the self-sorting/self-selection protocol in organic cage formation by harnessing the dynamic imine chemistry. During the course of the investigation it has been observed that non-covalent interaction especially hydrogen bonding could manipulate the outcome of such a process. Besides that,\\nselective formation of a single isomer of an organic cage from a reaction mixture of an unsymmetrical aldehyde and a flexible amine has been successfully achieved by simply fine tuning the geometric features (shape and size) of the reacting aldehyde.\\n\\nSuch three-dimensional cages are well appreciated by the scientific community owing to their potential applications in anion sensing, catalysis and gas storage/separation. However, they have not been explored as sensors for nitroaromatic explosives. Therefore, at this juncture several fluorescent organic cages have been synthesized and their potential application as chemosensor for the nitroaromatics has been tested. Moreover, a new synthetic protocol has been introduced for the post-synthetic modification of organic cages.\\n\\nChapter 1 covers a brief introduction about dynamic covalent chemistry with main emphasis on dynamic imine chemistry and its use in covalent cage synthesis. Moreover, this chapter accounts the very recent applications of such cage compounds in various fields such as a pours material for gas storage/separation, a molecular host for the stabilization of reactive species and for the recognition of ions or molecules.\\n\\nChapter 2 describes first time ever achieved self-sorting process in three-dimensional purely organic cages. First of all, four different [3+2] cages were synthesized by treating two different triamines with two different dialdehydes separately, by employing dynamic imine chemistry. The formation of desired cages was ascertained by various spectroscopic techniques. When a mixture of all the four components (two aldehydes and two amines) was subjected to reaction, only two cages were found to form (Scheme 1) out of several equally probable possibilities, which suggest a high-fidelity self-recognition. The issue of partner preferences was further verified by transforming a non-self-sorted cage into a self-sorted cage by treating the former with appropriate triamine or dialdehyde. For an in-depth understanding on this subject, theoretical calculations (gas phase DFT) were carried out, which suggested that observed self-sorting is a thermodynamically governed process.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nScheme 1. Self-sorting in organic imine cages through partner preferences.\\n\\nChapter 3 focuses that supramolecular interaction especially hydrogen-boding could be a possible way to direct a self-sorting process operating in imine based organic cage systems. It is a well-accepted fact that in most of the cases self-sorting process operates owing to the difference in geometric features (shape and size) of the competing building blocks. Thus increasing similarity in geometric features would create the situation more complex. It is anticipated that in such circumstances H-bonding could have a decisive role in partner selection. In order to investigate this, four different dialdehydes (A, B, C and D) having similar geometric background were synthesized. These aldehydes upon treatment with flexible amine X were found to form three nanosocpic [3+2] organic cages (aldehyde C gave insoluble uncharacterized material). When a one-pot reaction of triamine X with mixture of all the four aldehydes was carried out, selective formation of cage B3X2 was observed (Scheme 2). Conversely, the same reaction in absence of aldehyde B resulted in the formation of mixture of products. Theoretical and experimental studies fully support the fact that the presence of hydroxyl moiety adjacent to the formyl group in aldehyde B has the key role in selective formation of cage B3X2 from a complex reaction mixture, in which there are numerous equally probable possibilities. Such remarkable selection was further examined by converting a non-hydroxy (non-preferred) cage into hydroxy cage B3X2 (preferred) by treating the former with aldehyde B. The role of the H-bond in self-sorting process of two \\ndialdehydes and two triamines has been established. Furthermore, the possibility of cage–to-\\n\\ncage transformation through imine bond metathesis has also been addressed.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nScheme 2. H-bond directed 15-fold (2+3) incomplete self-sorting in organic imine cages.\\n\\nChapter 4 presents the investigation on the formation of single isomeric species of a [3+2] oligoimine cage from a reaction mixture of an unsymmetrical dialdehyde and a flexible triamine. So far, most of the reported organic cages are derived by symmetric building units. Asymmetric building blocks for the construction of such organic architectures are not the desirable choices, as they could lead to form mixture of isomeric cages.

Sediment samples were collected using a Shipek grab in December 2003. A core sub-sample was taken from each grab for analyzing total organic matter, total organic carbon, total nitrogen and phosphorus in different depths from three stations at various distances from the cage. These parameters were analyzed in the top layer of additional four stations. The results showed significant increase in all analyzed parameters in station 1, at 5m from the cage (p0.05), indicating localized impact of cage farming to the vicinity of cage. The analyzed parameters in various depth did not show significant differences (p>0.05). The value of analyzed parameters in the perimeter of the cage and their differences with reference stations showed small magnitude and localized impact on the chemistry of sediment. It might be due to deep water and moderate velocity of water current in this fjord. The magnitude of impact may differ during the summer season when biomass and feeding rate would be at the maximum level',\n",

       "    'description': 'To study the differences among commercial eggs from four housing systems i.e. cage, barn, free range and organic, 41 physical and chemical parameters were evaluated on 28 fresh egg samples from the Italian market. The univariate statistic analysis evidenced that organic eggs had the highest whipping capacity and foam consistency, but the lowest freshness (the highest air cell height) and albumen quality (the lowest Haugh Unit); cage eggs presented instead the lowest whipping capacity and the highest shell resistance to breaking. The multivariate technique discriminant partial least-squares regression was unable to correctly classify the eggs from the four housing systems, but successfully differentiated cage from alternative (organic + barn + free range) eggs. The variables with the most discriminant power were shell breaking resistance, overrun, protein content, and shell thickness',\n",

The univariate statistic analysis evidenced that organic eggs had the highest whipping capacity and foam consistency, but the lowest freshness (the highest air cell height) and albumen quality (the lowest Haugh Unit); cage eggs presented instead the lowest whipping capacity and the highest shell resistance to breaking. The multivariate technique discriminant partial least-squares regression was unable to correctly classify the eggs from the four housing systems, but successfully differentiated cage from alternative (organic + barn + free range) eggs.

PENDAHULUAN \\n \\nUdang karang atau lobster (Spiny \\nlobster) termasuk komoditi perikanan yang \\nmempunyai peranan penting sebagai komodi-\\ntas ekspor dari jenis krustasea setelah udang \\nPenaeid.  Udang ini diperdagangkan dalam \\nkeadaan hidup, dengan harga jual yang  terus \\nmelambung, karena permintaan akan komo-\\nditas ini di pasar global terus meningkat \\nsetiap tahun (Holmyard and  Franz, 2006; \\nSolanki et al., 2012). Pada tahun 2014, eks-\\npor udang karang tercatat US$ 42,8 juta de-\\nngan volume 3.427 ton, dengan negara tujuan \\nLaju Sedimentasi dan Dispersi Limbah Organik Budidaya Udang  Karang  dalam . . . \\n288                                                        http://itk.fpik.ipb.ac.id/ej_itkt71 \\nutama adalah Tiongkok dan Taiwan (BII, \\n2015).  \\nTingginya harga jual telah mendo-\\nrong perkembangan  budidaya udang karang \\nakhir-akhir, dan akibat penurunan hasil tang-\\nkapan di alam (Jones et al., 2010; Jones, \\n2010). Sejak tahun 2000 di Teluk Ekas, Pro-\\nvinsi Nusa Tenggara Barat berkembang budi-\\ndaya udang karang dalam keramba jaring \\napung (KJA). Pada waktu itu banyak ditemu-\\nkan benih alam yang  menempel pada pelam-\\npung dan material lain yang berkaitan dengan \\nbudidaya rumput laut dan kerapu (Priyam-\\nbodo and Sarifin, 2009), kemudian benih-\\nbenih tersebut diambil dan dipelihara dalam \\nKJA, sehingga kegiatan budidaya udang ka-\\nrang  terus berkembang sampai saat ini. \\nPerkembangan kegiatan budidaya di \\nwilayah pesisir dan laut dalam dua dekade \\nterakhir telah memicu perhatian banyak kala-\\nngan akibat dampak lingkungan yang ditim-\\nbulkannya (Mazzola et al., 2000;  Olsen and \\nOlsen, 2008). Meningkatnya budidaya ikan \\nsistem KJA berpotensi sebagai sumber ma-\\nsukkan  bahan organik dalam kolom dan da-\\nsar perairan, baik dalam bentuk padatan mau-\\npun tersuspensi (Shakouri, 2003). Limbah \\nbudidaya yang terlarut dan tersuspensi dalam \\nair dari sisa metabolik dan hasil ekskresi bio-\\nta budidaya tersebar ke kolom perairan oleh \\narus. Limbah padat berupa pakan yang tidak \\ntermakan dan feses tersebar dalam kolom \\nperairan dan terakumulasi di dasar perairan \\nsehingga berdampak pada lingkungan bentik \\n(Nash, 2001; Shakouri, 2003; Caroll et al., \\n2003). Selama sedimentasi, sebagian feses \\ndan sisa pakan tersebut dimangsa oleh orga-\\nnisme bukan budidaya sebelum mencapai \\ndasar perairan (Beveridge, 1996), sedangkan \\nsebahagian lagi pecah menjadi partikel halus \\ndan mengalami pelarutan serta cenderung \\nmeningkatkan turbiditas di sekitar lokasi bu-\\ndidaya (Silvert and Sowles, 1996). \\nDeposit limbah organik diperkirakan \\nmencapai 3 kg/m2/tahun di sekitar KJA, se-\\nmentara di bawah KJA mencapai 10 kg/m2/ \\ntahun (Gowen and Brandy, 1987 dalam Wu,  \\n1995). Sedimen dasar perairan di bawah KJA \\nyang mengalami perubahan fisika dan kimia \\ntidak lebih dari 50 m dari KJA (Morrisey et \\nal., 2000), sementara McGhie et al. (2000) \\nmenyebutkan sebaran beban limbah organik \\nmenjadi jarak 20 dari pusat KJA, dan pemu-\\nsatan sedimen dapat menutupi dasar perairan \\nmencapai jarak 30 m dari KJA (Rachman-\\nsyah, 2004).  Beban limbah budidaya ikan, \\nditambah limbah berbagai sumber lain dari \\ndaratan yang masuk ke perairan teluk ber-\\nkaitan dengan daya dukung untuk pengem-\\nbangan budidaya laut (Scholl et al., 2012).  \\nMenurut Krisanti dan Imran (2006),  kapasi-\\ntas asimilasi limbah perairan Teluk Ekas ter-\\nutama kadar amonia dan nitrat tidak lagi \\nmendukung untuk pengembangan kegiatan \\nbudidaya laut, kecuali dilakukan pengaturan \\ntata letak dan jarak antara unit KJA serta pem-\\nbatasan jumlah KJA yang boleh beroperasi. \\n Limbah partikel organik yang ber-\\nasal dari KJA secara nyata berpengaruh ter-\\nhadap lingkungan bentik (Mazzola et al., \\n2000). Ruiz et al. (2001) melaporkan bahwa \\nloading yang berasal dari budidaya ikan (30 \\nKJA pada luasan 7 ha dan kedalaman 20 m) \\nakan berdampak pada hilangnya padang la-\\nmun (Posidonia oceanica) seluas 11,29 ha. \\nDampak lain limbah budidaya ini adalah \\nterjadinya penurunan keanekaragaman in-\\nfauna dalam sedimen dan degradasi dasar \\nperairan, jika limbah menghasilkan deposit C \\norganik melebihi 0,7 kgC/m2/tahun (Gilli-\\nbrand et al., 2002).  Informasi mengenai laju \\nsedimentasi dan dispersi limbah organik pen-\\nting untuk diketahui dan bagaimana  sebaran \\nsedimen di sekitar KJA, apakah mengikuti \\npola arus atau tidak. Informasi tersebut dapat \\ndigunakan sebagai acuan dalam pengelolaan \\nbudidaya laut secara berkelanjutan terutama  \\nuntuk menentukan tata letak antar unit KJA.  \\nOleh karena, dilakukan penelitian  ini bertu-\\njuan untuk mengetahui laju sedimentasi dan \\ndispersi limbah organik budidaya udang ka-\\nrang dalam KJA di  perairan Teluk Ekas Pro-\\nvinsi Nusa Tenggara Barat. \\n \\n \\nJunaidi dan Hamzah \\n                  Jurnal Ilmu dan Teknologi Kelautan Tropis, Vol. 7, No. 1, Juni 2015                        289 \\nII. METODE PENELITIAN \\n \\n2.1. Wilayah Studi \\nTeluk Ekas terletak di sebelah sela-\\ntan Pulau Lombok, Provinsi Nusa Tenggara \\nBarat (Gambar 1).  Posisinya membujur dari \\nutara ke selatan, dengan letak geografis \\nantara 8o49’15”-8o55’0” LS dan 116o23’0”-\\n116o28’45” BT. Teluk Ekas berhadapan  \\nlangsung dengan Samudera Hindia, dan ber-\\ndekatan dengan Selat Alas yang menghu-\\nbungkan massa air dari Samudra Hindia \\ndengan Samudra Pasifik sehingga teluk ini \\nmenampung banyak suplai nutrien sehingga \\nberpotensi sebagai kawasan pengembangan \\nbudidaya laut (BRKP, 2004).  \\n \\n2.2. Budidaya Udang Karang dalam KJA \\nBudidaya udang karang dilakukan \\ndalam karamba  jaring apung (KJA) ukuran  \\n3 x 3 x 3 m3 sebanyak 3 unit yang  diletakkan \\ndalam satu unit rakit. KJA ditempatkan lo-\\nkasi dengan kedalaman perairan sekitar 8,5 \\nm. Benih udang karang jenis Panulirus \\nhomarus yang berukuran 15, 30, dan 45  \\ng/ekor diperoleh dari tempat pengumpulan di \\nsekitar  lokasi budidaya. Sebelum ditebar di-\\nlakukan proses adaptasi terhadap pakan dan \\nlingkungan budidaya selama seminggu. Pa-\\ndat penebaran adalah 150 ekor/KJA. Selama \\nmasa pemeliharaan yang berlangsung selama \\n270 hari (9 bulan),  diberi pakan berupa ikan \\nrucah (segar). Jumlah pakan yang diberikan \\nadalah 5% dari biomassa ikan setiap hari \\ndengan pemberian 1 kali sehari pada jam \\n17.00. Selama pemeliharaan udang karang \\ndilakukan pengukuran kecepatan arus dengan \\nfloater di sekitar KJA, dengan mengukur \\nwaktu tempuh pelampung menempuh jarak \\ntertentu.\\n \\n \\n \\nGambar 1.

Pendugaan Laju Sedimentasi \\nPengukuran laju pengendapan sedi-\\nmen selama pemeliharaan udang karang seti-\\nap bulan  di sekitar KJA, dilakukan dengan \\nmemasang perangkap sedimen (sediment \\ntrap) yang terbuat dari pipa paralon diameter \\n10,16 cm (4 inchi) dan panjang 50 cm, \\ndipasang dibawah KJA, pada jarak 50 m \\n(N50) dan 100 m (N100) ke arah utara, pada \\njarak 50 m (E50) dan 100 m (E100) ke arah \\ntimur, pada jarak 50 m (S50) dan 100 m \\n(E100) ke arah timur, pada jarak 50 m (S50) \\ndan 100 m (S100) ke arah selatan, dan pada \\njarak 50 m (W50) dan 100 m (W100) ke arah \\nbarat (Gambar 1). Perangkap dipasang pada \\nkedalaman 50 cm dari dasar perairan. Sampel \\nsedimen yang terperangkap tersebut bersum-\\nber dari limbah budidaya dan bukan budida-\\nya, dimana dalam penelitian ini kedua sedi-\\nmen tersebut tidak dipisahkan. Koleksi sedi-\\nmen dilakukan setiap bulan, sampel sedimen \\ndikeringkan dalam oven pada suhu 60 oC se-\\nlama 24 jam (English et al.,  1997), kemu-\\ndian dianalisis kadar air dan ditimbang bo-\\nbotnya. Laju sedimentasi dihitung dengan \\npersamaan (Lunusu dan Fitri, 2008) sebagai \\nberikut : \\n \\nLaju sedimentasi (g/m2/hari)=(Bks/Ap)/t  (1) \\n \\ndimana Bks= bobot kering sedimen (g), Ap= \\nluas penampang paralon (m2) dan t= periode \\nkoleksi sedimen (hari). \\n \\n2.4. Pengujian  Kecepatan Pengendapan \\nFeses dan Sisa Pakan \\nPengujian kecepatan pengendapan \\n(settling velocity) feses dan sisa pakan dila-\\nkukan dengan  mengacu pada metode yang \\ndikemukakan oleh Elbenzon and Kelly \\n(1998) dengan asumsi bahwa limbah partikel \\npakan yang  tidak dimakan dan feses akan \\nbergerak secara vertikel sampai kedasar ka-\\nrena tidak dipengaruhi oleh arus, dan nilai \\nkecepatan pengendapan partikel ini diguna-\\nkan untuk pendugaan model dispersi dan luas \\ndampak dampak limbah budidaya. Wadah \\npercobaan berupa akuarium kaca berukuran \\n20 x 20 cm2 dengan tinggi 125 cm dan \\ndilengkapi dengan mistar yang ditempelkan \\ndi bagian dinding akuarium. Akuarium diisi \\nair laut, bersalinitas 35 ppt yang telah disa-\\nring dengan filter bag, setinggi 120 cm. Pada  \\nbagian bawah akuarium setinggi 20 cm dari \\ndasar, diberi tanda sebagai kolom pengen-\\ndapan (untuk mengurangi tekanan permu-\\nkaan), sekaligus sebagai batas kedalaman air \\n100 cm dan permukaan. \\nFeses kering dikoleksi dengan cara \\nmenampung di bagian bawah KJA, kemudian \\ndikeringkan dan digerus serta diayak dengan \\nsaringan berukuran mata 0,5 mm. Sebanyak \\nsatu gram feses ditimbang tepat, masing-\\nmasing dimasukkan ke dalam akuarium butir \\ndemi butir dan dihitung waktu untuk me-\\nngendap sampai di batas tanda pada kedala-\\nman 100 cm. Observasi kecepatan pengen-\\ndapan dilakukan sebanyak 20 ulangan untuk \\nsetiap kelompok feses. Hal sama juga dila-\\nkukan terhadap sisa pakan. Kecepatan pe-\\nngendapan (KP) dihitung dengan formula : \\n \\nKP (cm/dt)=panjang kolom air 100 cm/  \\nwaktu yang dibutuhkan untuk mengendap \\n(dt) ……..………………….. (2) \\n \\n2.5. Dispersi Limbah Budidaya dan \\nLuasan Dampak \\nDispersi dan beban limbah organik \\npartikel ke sedimen tergantung pada jumlah \\nlimbah yang diproduksi, luasan budidaya, \\nkedalaman air di teluk, kecepatan arus, dan \\nlaju pengendapan limbah partikel. Model \\ndispersi limbah umumnya didasarkan atas \\nprinsip bahwa partikel feses dan pakan yang \\ntidak dimakan akan jatuh  dengan laju,  Vs \\nmelalui kedalaman air, D akan menempuh  \\nwaktu t=D/Vs untuk mencapai dasar  \\nperairan.

Perkiraan dispersi \\nlimbah dapat dihitung dengan persamaan \\nyang dîkemukakan oleh Gowen et al. (1989) \\ndiacu dalam (Barg, 1992 dan Beveridge, \\n1996) sebagai berikut: \\nJunaidi dan Hamzah \\n                  Jurnal Ilmu dan Teknologi Kelautan Tropis, Vol. 7, No. 1, Juni 2015                    291 \\nd = D x Cv / Vs ………………………… (3) \\n \\ndimana d= jarak dìspersi horizontal dari \\npartikel (m); D = kedalaman air di teluk (m); \\nCv= arus air (m/s); Vs= kecepatan pengen-\\ndapan limbah partikel pakan yang yang tidak \\ndimakan dan feses (m/s). \\nMelalui proses penyederhanaan, di-\\nmana dimensi lahan budidaya dan jarak \\npenyebaran melintang dan memanjang teluk, \\nmaka menurut Gillibrand et al. (2002), \\ndampak areal dasar perairan= AI (Wi), dapat \\ndihitung dengan persamaaan sebagai berikut: \\n \\nAI (Wi)= π (LF + DF) (LF + DY) ...……. (4) \\n \\ndimana: AI dihitung sebagai suatu elip \\ndengan axis utama (LF + DF) dan axis minor \\n(LF + DY). Areal AI dihitung untuk kece-\\npatan pengendapan tunggal, Wi. Dengan \\nmenggunakan rentang kecepatan pengenda-\\npan, sejumlah areal dasar perairan yang dipe-\\nngaruhi oleh perbedaan ukuran feses dapat \\nditentukan. \\n \\nIII. HASIL DAN PEMBAHASAN \\n \\n3.1.  Keragaan Budidaya Udang Karang \\ndalam KJA \\nBudidaya udang karang berlangsung \\nselama 9 bulan (270 hari) dalam 3 petak KJA  \\nberukuran 3 x 3 x 3 m3, dengan padat \\npenebaran tiap KJA sebanyak 150 ekor,  \\nmasing-masing dengan ukuran rata-rata yang \\nberbeda yaitu 45  g, 30 g, dan 15 g.  Selama \\nmasa pemeliharaan terjadi pertambahan \\nbobot biomassa udang  karang dari 15 – 45 g \\nmenjadi  151 – 220 g, dengan rata-rata laju \\npertumbuhan harian (LPH)  0,59 – 0,86 %, \\nrasio konversi pakan (RKP)  9,66 – 12,11 \\ndan sintasan 63,33 – 70 %. RKP dan sintasan \\nyang didapatkan dalam penelitian ini relatif \\nsama dengan hasil penelitian ACIAR-SADI, \\nyaitu RKP 12,0 dan sintasan 60% (Jones, \\n2010), sedangkan dengan pemberian pakan \\nberupa ikan Sardin (Sardinella spp) sebanyak \\n10%-20% diperoleh sintasan lebih tinggi \\nyaitu 86,7% (Becira dan Orcajada, 2006). \\nLaju pertumbuhan harian lebih tinggi diban-\\ndingkan penelitian Aslianti et al. (2004) yaitu \\n0,236 %. \\n \\n3.2. Laju Sedimentasi Limbah   \\nLaju sedimentasi di bawah KJA pada  \\nbudidaya udang karang selama 270 hari \\nberkisar antara 14,92-27,33 (20,66±4,60) \\ng/m2/hari, lebih tinggi dibandingkan dengan \\nlokasi pengamatan di bagian utara, timur, \\nselatan dan barat KJA pada jarak  50 dan 100 \\nm (Gambar 2). Hal ini menunjukkan bahwa \\nkegiatan budidaya udang karang dalam KJA \\nmemberikan konstribusi yang cukup signi-\\nfikan terhadap laju sedimentasi yang berasal \\ndari partikel organik (feses dan sisa pakan).  \\nLaju sedimentasi yang paling kecil berada \\npada bagian sebelah timur KJA baik untuk \\njarak 50 m maupun 100 m, sedangkan pada \\nbagian utara, selatan dan barat relatif sama. \\nPola penyebaran sedimen terkait dengan pola \\narus pasang yang mengarah dari timur dan \\nsurut dari arah barat serta arah  datang arus \\ntegak lurus dengan posisi KJA, sehingga \\npenyebaran sedimen lebih dominan pada \\nbagian utara, selatan dan barat posisi KJA \\nkarena lebih dekat ke arah pantai. Hal ini \\nmenunjukkan bahwa sedimen yang berasal \\ndari KJA tidak menyebar jauh dari lokasi \\nKJA, karena kecepatan rata-rata arus berkisar \\nantara 0,068-0,2 m/dt. \\n \\n3.3. Laju Pengendapan  Feses dan Pakan \\nLaju pengendapan feses udang karang \\nukuran  <0,5 mm adalah 3,73±0,33 cm/dt, \\nsedangkan feses kering berukuran >0,5 \\nadalah 5,95±0,42 cm/dt (Tabel 1).  Semakin \\nbesar bobot  pakan ikan rucah, laju pengen-\\ndapan semakin cepat. Laju pengendapan \\nfeses dan pakan berperan penting pendugaan \\ndispersi limbah budidaya di dasar perairan. \\nGillibrand et al. (2002), melaporkan laju \\npengendapan, kecepatan arus dan kedalaman \\nperairan mempengaruhi dispersi feses atau \\npakan yang tidak dimakan di dasar perairan. \\nLaju Sedimentasi dan Dispersi Limbah Organik Budidaya Udang Karang dalam . . . \\n292                                                         http://itk.fpik.ipb.ac.id/ej_itkt71 \\n \\n \\nGambar 2.

Dispersi dan Luas Dampak Limbah  \\nLimbah padat budidaya udang karang \\ndalam KJA terdiri dari sisa pakan dan feses, \\nakan terdispersi dan sebagian besar menetap \\ndibawah atau dalam jarak tertentu dari KJA. \\nSebaran lokasi dan jumlah limbah padat yang \\ntersedimentasi tergantung pada jumlah lim-\\nbah, kecepatan tenggelamnya partikel, kece-\\npatan arus dan kedalaman air.  Berdasarkan \\npengamatan dan analisis laju sedimentasi \\ndiperoleh bahwa limbah padat budidaya \\nudang karang tidak menyebar jauh dari lokasi \\nKJA, karena arus laut hanya berkisar antara \\n0,068-0,2 m/dt. Kecepatan pengendapan fe-\\nses dan sisa pakan berkisar antara 0,0373 – \\n0,072 m/dt, kedalaman perairan 8,50 m, \\nmaka dengan Gowen et al. (1989) dalam \\nBarg (1992) diperoleh penyebaran partikel \\nfeses dan sisa pakan mencapai jarak antara \\n8,24-45,58 m dari KJA (Gambar 3). \\nHasil penelitian Morrisey et al. \\n(2000), mendapatkan bahwa sedimen dasar \\ndiperairan di bawah KJA yang mengalami \\nperubahan fisika dan kimia tidak lebih dari \\n50 m dari KJA, sementara McGhie et al. \\n(2000) menyebutkan sebaran beban limbah \\norganik menjadi jarak 20 m  dari pusat KJA, \\ndan pemusatan sedimen dapat menutupi \\nJunaidi dan Hamzah \\n                  Jurnal Ilmu dan Teknologi Kelautan Tropis, Vol. 7, No. 1, Juni 2015                   293 \\ndasar perairan mencapai jarak 30 m dari KJA \\n(Rachmansyah, 2004). Jika dilihat dari \\ndispersi sedimen selama kurun waktu peme-\\nliharaan udang karang, terlihat bahwa pemu-\\nsatan pengendapan bahan organik mem-\\nbentuk bidang elip di bawah KJA (Gambar \\n4). Perubahan wilayah dampak yang terjadi \\nakibat pola arus.  \\nInformasi laju sedimentasi (Gambar \\n2) memiliki pola yang relatif sama dengan \\nhasil perhitungan jarak sebaran pengendapan \\npa-datan organik (Gambar 3). Hal ini berarti \\ndata laju sedimentasi di sekitar KJA yang \\ndiukur dapat mendukung pembuktian bahwa \\nmodel pendugaan jarak penyebaran pengen-\\ndapan di sekitar KJA yang didasarkan atas \\ninformasi kedalaman, kecepatan arus, dan \\nkecepatan pengendapan dapat menggam-\\nbarkan wilayah dampak KJA. Berdasarkan \\npenyebaran limbah padat dari KJA di dasar \\nperairan, maka untuk menghindari penum-\\npukan partikel limbah di dasar KJA, maka \\ntata letak antar unit KJA harus berjarak \\nminimal 2 kali jarak terjauh penyebaran \\npartikel (2 x 45,58 = 91,16 m) atau dibuatkan \\nmenjadi  >100 m. Pemulihan lingkungan \\nbentik di dasar KJA dapat dilakukan dengan \\nmenerapkan sistem rotasi letak KJA untuk \\nmemberikan peluang terjadinya proses pemu-\\nlihan lingkungan bentik secara alami. \\nMenurut Gillibrand  et al. (2002), wi-\\nlayah dampak limbah padat budidaya dalam \\nKJA dalam teluk berbentuk ellips karena \\nlebar teluk memiliki arus pasut melintang \\nteluk dibandingkan dengan besarnya ampli-\\ntudo memanjang teluk, dimana panjang dan \\nsempit teluk akan banyak melemahkan \\namplitudo arua melintang sehingga jarak pe-\\nnyebaran melintang teluk menjadi lebih ke-\\ncil. Usaha budidaya  udang karang dengan 1 \\nunit rakit yang berukuran 11 x 11 m2  yang \\nterdiri dari 9 petak KJA masing-masing \\nberukuran 3 x 3 m2, maka luas dampak ben-\\ntik dengan kecepatan arus 0,067 – 0.2 m/dt \\ndan laju pengendapan feses dan pakan \\nberkisar antara 0,0373 – 0,072 m/dt, maka \\nwilayah dampak berkisar antara 1.352,41 – \\n3.370,39 m2. Luas wilayah dampak KJA \\ndalam penelitian lebih besar dibandingkan \\nhasil penelitian Rachmansyah (2004) di Te-\\nluk Awarange Kabupaten Barru, Sulawesi \\nSelatan yaitu berkisara antara 493 – 1.097 \\nm2.

Laju sedimen (g/m2/hari) di bawah dan sekitar KJA selama pemeliharaan udang \\nkarang. \\n  \\nbah yang diproduksi, luasan budidaya, keda-\\nlaman air di teluk, kecepatan arus, dan laju \\npengendapan limbah partikel (Gillibrand et \\nal., 2002). \\nLimbah partikel organik yang berasal \\ndari KJA secara nyata berpengaruh terhadap \\nlingkungan bentik. Ruiz et al. (2001) mela-\\nporkan bahwa loading yang berasal dari \\nbudidaya ikan (30 KJA pada luasan 7 ha dan \\nkedalaman 20 m) akan berdampak pada hi-\\nlangnya padang lamun (Posidonia oceanica) \\nseluas 11,29 ha. Dampak lain limbah budi-\\ndaya ini adalah terjadinya penurunan keane-\\nkaragaman infauna dalam sedimen dan de-\\ngradasi dasar perairan, jika limbah meng-\\nhasilkan deposit C organik melebihi 0,7 \\nkgC/m2/tahun (Gillibrand et al., 2002).  \\nDampak limbah budidaya udang karang da-\\nlam KJA di Teluk Ekas secara nyata belum \\nberpengaruh terhadap penurunan keaneka-\\nragaman hayati, ataupun kondisi hypoxia, \\nakan tetapi hanya berpengaruh terhadap \\npenurunan kualitas (Junaidi dan Hamzah, \\n2014).   \\nAktivitas budidaya dalam KJA ter-\\nnyata merupakan atraktor (daya tarik)  bagi \\nikan liar di sekitar lokasi KJA. Ikan-ikan liar \\ntersebut akan berkumpul di sekitar KJA \\ndengan berbagai sebab misalnya untuk men-\\ncari makan dari sisa makanan yang lolos dari \\nKJA, karena bau pakan (ikan rucah) yang \\nkhas. Bahkan sisa pakan yang masih tertam-\\npung dalam jaring oleh jenis ikan tertentu \\nseperti ikan buntal berusaha untuk memakan \\nsisa pakan dengan menggigit jaring sampai \\nbocor.  Karena itu, masih banyak informasi \\nilmiah yang dibutuhkan untuk melengkapi \\nmodel agar mendekati ke kondisi sistem yang \\nJunaidi dan Hamzah \\n                  Jurnal Ilmu dan Teknologi Kelautan Tropis, Vol. 7, No. 1, Juni 2015                   295 \\nsebenarnya. Namun demikian, model terse-\\nbut dapat digunakan sebagai acuan untuk \\nmengelola sumberdaya perikanan budidaya \\ndalam upaya meminimalkan dampak ter-\\nhadap kondisi dasar perairan di bawah KJA, \\nkhususnya yang berkaitan dengan pengaturan  \\ntata letak unit KJA. \\n \\nIV. KESIMPULAN  \\n \\nLaju sedimentasi di bawah KJA pada  \\nbudidaya udang karang selama 270 hari di per-\\nairan Teluk Ekas berkisar antara 14,92-27,33 \\n(20,66±4,60) g/m2/hari. Limbah organik budi-\\ndaya udang karang tidak menyebar jauh dari \\nlokasi KJA, karena arus laut hanya berkisar \\nantara 0,068-0,2 m/dt. Kecepatan pengendapan \\nfeses dan sisa pakan berkisar antara 0,0373 – \\n0,072 m/dt dengan kedalaman perairan 8,50 m, \\nmaka diperoleh penyebaran partikel feses dan \\nsisa pakan mencapai jarak antara 8,24-45,58 m \\ndari KJA. Berdasarkan penyebaran limbah or-\\nganik dari KJA di dasar perairan, maka untuk \\nmenghindari penumpukan partikel limbah di \\ndasar KJA, maka tata letak antar unit KJA harus \\nberjarak minimal 2 kali jarak terjauh penyebaran \\npartikel (2 x 45,58 = 91,16 m) atau dibuatkan \\nmenjadi  >100 m. \\n \\nUCAPAN TERIMA KASIH \\n \\nKami berterima kasih kepada Saudara \\nMuhammad Zainul Hayyi, S.Pi., dan Andy \\nMattalata atas bantuannya dalam pengum-\\npulan data di lapang dan analisis di labo-\\nratorium. \\n \\nDAFTAR PUSTAKA \\n \\nAslianti, T., B.

Measurement of sedimentation rate was conducted every month during the process of cultivation lobster. This measurement was done by setting up a sediment trap under and around the cage. The result of this study showed that sedimentation rate under the lobster cage within 270 days ranged from 14.92 to 27.33 (20.66±4.60) g/m2/day. The organic waste did not disperse far away from the cage because of the small current rate around the cage location of 0.068 to 0.2 m/s. Feces and residual feed settling velocities followed the current direction within the range of 0.0373 to 0.072 m/s with 8.50 m of water depth. According to this result,  dispersion of feces particle and residual food was between 8.24 and 45.58 m from the cage. In order to prevent an accumulation of waste particle on the water bottom, the distance between cages needs to be set to at least twice of the farthest distance of particle dispersion which is 2 x 45.58 = 91.16 m or about 100 m.</dc:description><dc:language>\\n\\n  id</dc:language><dc:creator>\\n\\n  Junaidi, M.

Utilizing the dynamic covalent chemistry approach from three geometrically similar dialdehydes (A, B, and D) and the flexible triamine tris(2-aminoethyl)amine (X), three new 3+2] self-assembled nanoscopic organic cages have been synthesized and fully characterized by various techniques. When a complex mixture of the dialdehydes and triamine X was subjected to reaction, it was found that only dialdehyde B (which has OH groups for H-bonding) reacted to form the corresponding cage B3X2 selectively. Surprisingly, the same reaction in the absence of aldehyde B yielded a mixture of products. Theoretical and experimental investigations are in complete agreement that the presence of the hydroxyl moiety adjacent to the aldehyde functionality in B is responsible for the selective formation of cage B3X2 from a complex reaction mixture. This spectacular selection was further analyzed by transforming a nonpreferred (non-hydroxy) cage into a preferred (hydroxy) cage B3X2 by treating the former with aldehyde B. The role of the H-bond in partner selection in a mixture of two dialdehydes and two amines has also been established.

       "    'description': 'A supramolecular approach that uses hydrogen-bonding interaction as a driving force to accomplish exceptional self-sorting in the formation of imine-based covalent organic cages is discussed. Utilizing the dynamic covalent chemistry approach from three geometrically similar dialdehydes (A, B, and D) and the flexible triamine tris(2-aminoethyl)amine (X), three new 3+2] self-assembled nanoscopic organic cages have been synthesized and fully characterized by various techniques. When a complex mixture of the dialdehydes and triamine X was subjected to reaction, it was found that only dialdehyde B (which has OH groups for H-bonding) reacted to form the corresponding cage B3X2 selectively. Surprisingly, the same reaction in the absence of aldehyde B yielded a mixture of products. Theoretical and experimental investigations are in complete agreement that the presence of the hydroxyl moiety adjacent to the aldehyde functionality in B is responsible for the selective formation of cage B3X2 from a complex reaction mixture. This spectacular selection was further analyzed by transforming a nonpreferred (non-hydroxy) cage into a preferred (hydroxy) cage B3X2 by treating the former with aldehyde B. The role of the H-bond in partner selection in a mixture of two dialdehydes and two amines has also been established. Moreover, an example of unconventional imine bond metathesis in organic cage-to-cage transformation is reported',\n",

In this work, based on\\nthe finding of a synergistic interaction between metal–organic\\nframeworks (MOFs) and natural polyphenols under weak basic condition,\\na facile strategy has been developed for directly fabricating diverse\\nphenolic-inspired functional materials or metal-phenolic frameworks\\n(MPFs) with controlled hollow nanostructures (polyhedral core–shell,\\nrattle-like, hollow cage, etc.) and controllable size, morphology,\\nand roughness, as well as composition. By further incorporating the\\ndiverse functionalities of polyphenols such as low toxicity and therapeutic\\nproperties, catalytic activity, and ability to serve as carbon precursors,\\ninto the novel assemblies, diverse artificially designed nanoarchitectures\\nwith target functionalities have been generated for an array of applications.</dc:description><dc:date>\\n          2017-04-11T00:00:00Z</dc:date><dc:type>\\n          Text</dc:type><dc:type>\\n          Journal contribution</dc:type><dc:identifier>\\n          10.1021/acsami.7b01788.s001</dc:identifier><dc:relation>\\n          https://figshare.com/articles/Controlled_Fabrication_of_Functional_Capsules_Based_on_the_Synergistic_Interaction_between_Polyphenols_and_MOFs_under_Weak_Basic_Condition/4877648</dc:relation><dc:rights>\\n          CC BY-NC 4.0</dc:rights>\\n        </oai_dc:dc>\\n      </metadata>\\n    </record>',\n",

\\n \\nIntroduction \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nIntroduction \\n \\n \\n2 \\n \\n1.1 Porous Materials \\nPorous materials are important for a wide range of applications, especially in areas \\nsuch as molecular separations, gas storage and catalysis.\\n1\\n These materials can be \\nclassified according to their pore size:\\n2\\n (i) pores with widths exceeding 50 nm are \\ncalled macropores; (ii) pores with widths between 2 nm and 50 nm are called \\nmesopores, and; (iii) pores with widths smaller than 2 nm are called micropores. \\nSpecifically, microporous materials are of most interest in this thesis because their \\npore dimensions are comparable to small gas molecules such as N2, H2 and CO2, \\nwhich themselves are relevant in a range of gas storage and separation applications. \\nAccording to Barbour, there are three types of porosity, each with its own definition.\\n3\\n \\nVirtual porosity describes the deletion of selected atoms, typically solvent or ion \\nmolecules, from the crystal structure to afford a virtually porous material. In reality, \\nthis is not a stable form of porosity, since guest removal is usually accompanied by \\ncontraction of the crystal packing. Porosity “without pores” occurs when dynamic \\nprocesses arise within the crystal during guest uptake. This creates transient \\nopportunities for guest diffusion to occur, despite a lack of interconnected voids. \\nFinally, conventional porosity is achieved when solvent molecules can be physically \\nremoved without disrupting the pore topology of the host.  \\nActivated carbon (or charcoal) and zeolites are traditional and cheap classes of \\nmicroporous materials. They exhibit high surface areas and are utilised in a wide \\nvariety of commercial applications including separation processes and heterogeneous \\ncatalysis.\\n4\\n However, the ability to tune pore size and therefore the properties of these \\nmaterials is not as straightforward as it is to synthetically construct microporous \\nmaterials consisting of novel chemical compositions. In recent years, a plethora of \\nmicroporous materials have been prepared using various synthetic approaches, and \\ntheir properties assessed, especially with respect to their ability to adsorb gases. An \\nimportant factor in determining the significance of these microporous materials is the \\nBrunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area, although other factors including \\nselectivity and the incorporation of particular functionality also rank highly. In the \\ninterests of this thesis, microporous materials can be divided into two sub-sets:  \\n(i) those with extended frameworks and networks and (ii) those consisting of discrete \\norganic molecules.  \\nIntroduction \\n \\n \\n3 \\n \\n1.2 Porous Frameworks and Networks \\n1.2.1 Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs) \\nAlso known as porous coordination polymers (PCPs), MOFs are a crystalline class of \\nporous materials that have been the subject of intensive research over the past decade \\nor so. They are constructed from metal-containing nodes (also known as secondary \\nbuilding units, or SBUs) and organic linkers, with most materials possessing 3-D \\nstructures comprising uniform pores and a network of channels.\\n5\\n The variance of \\nthese SBUs and organic linkers offers an enormous degree of structural and \\nfunctional tunability, and hence the potential to design MOFs with deliberate and \\ndistinct structures and properties. Their permanent porosities, low densities, and \\nwell-defined pores and channels have identified MOFs as ideal candidates for a \\nrange of applications, ranging from gas storage and separations to catalysis.\\n6-8\\n In \\naddition, their crystallinity allows detailed structural characterisation, which in \\nconjunction with computational modelling helps both predict and aid explanation of \\ntheir physical properties.\\n9\\n  \\nLi et al. reported one of the first examples of a MOF demonstrating microporosity, \\nwhere Zn(BDC – 1,4-benzenedicarboxylate) was shown to have a Langmuir surface \\narea of 310 m\\n2\\n g\\n-1\\n.\\n10\\n Since then, the reported surface areas of MOFs have risen \\nsignificantly, encompassing a wide range of SBUs, organic linkers and topologies. In \\n2002, Eddaoudi et al. presented a series of MOFs based on MOF-5,\\n11\\n which is \\nconstructed from octahedral Zn-O-C clusters and benzene links. Each framework \\nwas constructed to possess different pore functionalities and sizes whilst retaining the \\nsame framework topology as MOF-5 (Figure 1.1).\\n12\\n This isoreticular collection of \\nMOFs (IRMOFs) was shown to be thermally stable and highlighted the ease with \\nwhich different functional groups could be introduced whilst systematically varying \\nboth the pore size and the resulting porosity. By both extending the lengths of the \\norganic linkers and employing a mixed linker strategy, Furukawa et al. demonstrated \\nthat this heterogeneity principle\\n13\\n could generate MOFs of extremely high permanent \\nporosities, with MOF-210 exhibiting a BET surface area of 6240 m\\n2\\n g\\n-1\\n.\\n14\\n This was \\nthe highest surface area ever measured until, in 2012, Farha et al. reported the MOF \\nNU-110, which possessed a BET surface area of 7140 m\\n2\\n g\\n-1\\n.\\n9\\n Using extended, slim \\nhexa-carboxylated organic linkers consisting of an acetylene-based backbone, \\nIntroduction \\n \\n \\n4 \\n \\nultrahigh porosity was attained, while the employment of an rht-topology avoided \\nany structural fragility or self-interpenetration. \\n \\nFigure 1.1 (a) Benzene-based organic linkers with different functionalities utilised in \\nthe synthesis of the IRMOF series. (b) Single crystal X-ray structures of IRMOF-5 \\n(top) and IRMOF-6 (bottom).\\n12\\n \\n1.2.2 Covalent Organic Frameworks (COFs) \\nCOFs are well-defined, crystalline porous structures composed of lightweight \\nelements (C, O, B and N) linked by strong covalent bonds. In order to obtain a \\ncrystalline and ordered COF structure, the building units must react under dynamic \\ncovalent bond control and with the appropriate conformation and rigidity to enforce \\ndirectional-bond formation.\\n15\\n Côté et al. were the first to report the successful \\npreparation of COFs, with the 2-D materials COF-1 and COF-5 synthesised through \\nboroxine and boronate ester bond formation respectively.\\n16\\n Both were found to \\npossess high thermal stabilities and permanent porosities. Since then, a range of \\nreversible approaches have been used to prepare COFs (Figure 1.2a), including those \\nwith 3-D architectures that have been shown to possess BET surface areas in excess \\nof 4000 m\\n2\\n g\\n-1\\n.\\n17\\n Due to their high surface areas and low densities, 3-D COFs are \\ngood candidates for the storage of gases, including H2 and CH4. Alternatively, as 2-D \\nCOFs consist of stacked sheets which form aligned columns (Figure 1.2b), they may \\nalso aid the transport of charge carriers in the stacking direction;\\n15\\n therefore offering \\nIntroduction \\n \\n \\n5 \\n \\npotential as semi-conducting and photo-conducting materials,\\n18\\n as well as materials \\nfor energy storage.\\n19\\n  \\n \\nFigure 1.2 (a) Schematic representation of the reactions used for the synthesis of \\nCOFs.\\n15\\n (b) Structural representation of 2-D COF-5.\\n16\\n (c) Structural representation of \\n3-D COF-102.\\n17\\n  \\n1.2.3 Polymers of Intrinsic Microporosity (PIMs)  \\nPIMs can be prepared either as insoluble networks or as soluble linear polymers. \\nNetwork-PIMs were originally developed by McKeown et al. to prepare \\nphthalocyanine-based network polymers, where rigid spirocyclic cross-links were \\nemployed to prevent close-packing of the phthalocyanine components and give \\nmicroporous materials with BET surface areas in the range 450 – 950 m2 g-1.20 \\nThe soluble linear polymers consist of robust covalent bonds, with the porosity \\narising from their rigid and highly contorted molecular structures being unable to \\npack efficiently in the solid state (Figure 1.3b).\\n21\\n A lack of rotational freedom \\nensures they cannot rearrange their conformation to initiate collapse; this retains the \\nintrinsic microporosity. The classic example is PIM-1, which is prepared via dioxane \\nformation using a 1,1'-spirobisindane (SBI), with the spiro-centre acting as the site of \\ncontortion, and 1,4-dicyanotetrafluorobenzene.\\n22\\n Isolated as an amorphous powder \\nwith a BET surface area of 860 m\\n2\\n g\\n-1\\n, PIM-1 is soluble in organic solvents, which \\nenables it to be cast into films to act as membranes for gas separation applications \\nincluding O2/N2 and H2/N2 separations for example. A great number of PIMs have \\nIntroduction \\n \\n \\n6 \\n \\nbeen synthesised since then,\\n23-25\\n with different macromolecular backbones employed \\nto enhance both shape persistence and performance.\\n26\\n An example of this is  \\nPIM-EA-TB, which contains both ethanoanthracene (EA) and Trögers base (TB) \\nbicyclic units (Figure 1.3a).\\n26\\n Along with a high BET surface area in excess of  \\n1000 m\\n2\\n g\\n-1\\n, the rigidity of these units resulted in enhanced permeability properties \\ncompared to other PIM membranes. \\n \\nFigure 1.3 (a) Molecular structures of PIM-1, PIM-SBI-TB and PIM-EA-TB.  \\n(b) A molecular model of PIM-EA-TB demonstrating its contorted shape.\\n26\\n \\n1.2.4 Conjugated Microporous Polymers (CMPs) \\nThe first generation of CMPs was reported by Cooper and co-workers, where organic \\nconjugated poly(aryleneethynylene) polymers were synthesised via Sonogashira-\\nHagihara coupling (Figure 1.4b).\\n27\\n Prepared under kinetic control, amorphous solids \\nwere isolated with no long-range molecular order, unlike MOFs and COFs. Using \\nrigid organic linkers of varying length enabled tuning of the microporosity, with BET \\nsurface areas of up to 834 m\\n2\\n g\\n-1 \\nbeing achieved.  \\nCMP design relies on the covalent linking of building blocks with a π-conjugated \\nbond (Figure 1.4a).\\n28\\n The preparation of a conjugated skeleton can be achieved using \\na range of synthetic reactions including Suzuki cross-coupling,\\n29\\n Yamamoto \\nreaction\\n30\\n and cyclotrimerization,\\n31\\n for example. The ability to tune the pore size, \\ngeometry and functional groups inherent to the polymer structure gives rise to a large \\nIntroduction \\n \\n \\n7 \\n \\nnumber of potential porous materials, with applications ranging from heterogeneous \\ncatalysis to light harvesting.\\n32-34\\n \\n \\nFigure 1.4 (a) Schematic representation of the reactions used for the synthesis of \\nCMPs.\\n28\\n (b) Schematic representation of the structure and (c) the node-strut topology \\nfor simulated network fragments of CMP-1.\\n27\\n   \\n1.2.5 Porous Aromatic Frameworks (PAFs) \\nPAFs are rigid open-framework structures constructed from covalent bonds. Their \\nstructure was originally based on that of diamond, whereby each carbon atom is \\ntetrahedrally connected to four neighbouring atoms.\\n35\\n By inserting rigid phenyl rings \\nand using an optimised nickel-catalysed Yamamoto-type Ullman-coupling \\nprocedure, Ben et al. were able to synthesise PAF-1, which was found to exhibit high \\nphysicochemical stabilities and a superb BET surface area of 5640 m\\n2\\n g\\n-1\\n.\\n36\\n By \\nreplacing the tetrahedral sp\\n3\\n-carbon with silicon and employing a mixed-solvent \\nsystem at room temperature, Yuan et al. isolated PPN-4, which had a superior BET \\nsurface area of 6461 m\\n2\\n g\\n-1\\n, and is among the most porous materials measured to date \\n(Figure 1.5).\\n37\\n  \\nIntroduction \\n \\n \\n8 \\n \\n \\nFigure 1.5 Synthetic route (left) for the synthesis of PAF materials including PAF-1 \\n(X: C) and PPN-4 (X: Si) and a molecular model (right) demonstrating the idealised \\nnon-interpenetrated diamondoid network of PPN-4.\\n35\\n \\n1.2.6 Hyper-Cross-Linked Polymers (HCPs) \\nHCPs are typically prepared via Friedel-Crafts alkylation reaction, where permanent \\nporosity results from extensive cross-linking preventing the polymer chains from \\ncollapsing into a non-porous state, with the resulting materials exhibiting high \\nthermal and chemical stabilities.\\n38\\n They can be prepared in different ways, including \\npost-crosslinking of polymers to form “Davankov-type” resins,39 or by “knitting” \\ntogether rigid aromatic building blocks using formaldehyde dimethyl acetal as an \\nexternal cross-linker (Figure 1.6).\\n40\\n The latter strategy has proven to be especially \\neffective because it enables microporous materials to be prepared using a range of \\naromatic monomers, as well as allowing the facile introduction of various functional \\ngroups to tune the properties.\\n41\\n In addition, this approach avoids the use of precious \\nmetal catalysts or the need to employ specific monomers with polymerisable groups. \\nThe BET surface areas of HCPs have been found to approach 1500 m\\n2\\n g\\n-1\\n,\\n42\\n and with \\ntheir physicochemical stabilities and the ability to selectively capture large amounts \\nof CO2, HCPs have been shown to be strong candidates for the capture of CO2 under \\npre-combustion conditions.\\n43\\n  \\nIntroduction \\n \\n \\n9 \\n \\n \\nFigure 1.6 Reaction scheme for the synthesis of a microporous “knitted” HCP \\nnetwork.\\n43\\n  \\n1.3 Porous Organic Molecules \\nThe majority of microporous materials are composed of directional covalent or \\ncoordination bonds, such as the MOFs, COFs and organic network polymers that are \\ndiscussed above. Permanently porous materials comprising discrete organic \\nmolecules are rare because most organic molecules pack efficiently in the solid state \\nto form structures with minimal void volume.\\n44\\n Even if porosity is achieved, weak \\nnon-covalent interactions between the molecules can result in cavity collapse upon \\ndesolvation and hence the porosity is lost. Due to the range of non-covalent \\ninteractions which dictate their packing efficiency in the solid state, it is also \\nchallenging to predict the assembly of these molecules. Taking this into account, \\ntheir design and synthesis must be carefully considered.  \\nThere are now many examples of organic molecules with structures that are stable \\ntowards desolvation, therefore forming permanently porous molecular crystals.\\n45\\n \\nThese range from molecules which typically possess a pre-fabricated “hole” of some \\ntype (e.g. cucurbiturils,\\n46\\n calixarenes,\\n47\\n Noria waterwheel\\n48\\n or porous organic \\ncages\\n49\\n) to those where the porosity is generated through inefficient packing of the \\nmolecules (e.g. Dianin’s compound,50 tris(o-phenylenedioxy)cyclotriphosphazene \\n(TPP)\\n51\\n or dipeptides\\n52\\n). From the viewpoints of synthetic strategy and properties, \\nthe latter approach has recently been shown to be adaptable in the creation of porous \\nmaterials consisting of discrete molecules of specific shape and directionality.  \\nKohl et al. synthesised a series of D3h-symmetric shape-persistent triptycene \\nIntroduction \\n \\n \\n10 \\n \\nderivatives which displayed high internal molecular free volumes.\\n53\\n They were \\nshown to form micropores in the solid state, with narrow pore-size distributions \\n(PSDs) and BET surface areas as high as 754 m\\n2\\n g\\n-1\\n. Similarly, Taylor et al. attached \\ntriptycene-based components to a biphenyl core, with their rigid structures \\npreventing efficient packing.\\n54\\n These organic molecules of intrinsic microporosity \\n(OMIMs) were shown to possess BET surface areas in the range 515 – 702 m2 g-1. \\nPerhaps the most celebrated structure amongst this classification is that of \\ntriptycenetrisbenzimidazolone (TTBI), which was reported by Mastalerz and Oppel \\nto self-assemble by co-operative hydrogen bonding to give a microporous crystalline \\nmaterial (Figure 1.7).\\n55\\n Upon activation via solvent swapping, the BET surface area \\nwas found to be a remarkable 2796 m\\n2\\n g\\n-1\\n. This is among the highest surface areas \\never measured for a discrete molecule.   \\n \\nFigure 1.7 (a) Molecular structure and (b) single crystal X-ray structure of TTBI.\\n55\\n  \\nThe main advantage that porous organic molecules hold over extended frameworks \\nand networks is that they can possess a high degree of solubility in a variety of \\nsolvents. This quality provides a degree of flexibility with regards to both their \\npreparation and subsequent processing. The ability to dissolve them allows ease of \\npurification via recrystallisation or chromatography, whilst the ability to post-\\nsynthetically modify their chemical structure, or induce the creation of new \\npolymorphs, enables their properties to be tailored towards a certain function or \\napplication. In addition, they offer the potential to be cast into composite structures \\nand deliver improved material properties. With regards to these ambitions, porous \\norganic cage molecules have been instrumental in advancing the merits of this \\napproach, making them an established class of porous materials in their own right.  \\n \\nIntroduction \\n \\n \\n11 \\n \\n1.3.1 Porous Organic Cages (POCs) \\nPOCs have proven to be an effective and fascinating approach towards the synthesis \\nof porous materials consisting of discrete organic molecules. The recent major \\nadvances that have been made in their preparation are due to the application of \\ndynamic covalent chemistry. Under certain conditions, this exploits reversible \\ncovalent bond formation to achieve the most thermodynamically stable product.\\n56\\n \\nThis means that even once the initial products are formed, changing the reaction \\nenvironment can result in an adjustment in their distribution towards the isolation of \\na single product.\\n57\\n By utilising this approach, POC molecules consisting of covalent \\nbonds may be prepared, typically requiring the use of simple starting materials and \\nproceeding in one step and in high yields. It is therefore a very powerful and \\nadaptable tool. It has enabled a large number of POC molecules to be synthesised \\nover the past few years, with many remaining shape-persistent upon desolvation and \\nexhibiting BET surface areas to rival those of extended porous frameworks and \\nnetworks.\\n58\\n The majority of POCs synthesised to date rely on the formation of an \\nimine bond through the reaction of a primary amine and an aldehyde,\\n59\\n although \\nmore recently, boronate ester methodologies have also been shown to be a promising \\nroute towards their preparation.\\n60\\n   \\nImine Bond-Based Cages \\nThe first series of POC molecules was reported by Tozawa et al. in 2009.\\n61\\n The \\nreaction of 1,3,5-triformylbenzene (TFB) with three different vicinal diamines \\nyielded [4+6] cages where the porosity was pre-fabricated and intrinsic to the cage \\nstructure, with the molecules packing together via non-covalent interactions to \\ngenerate extended structures in the solid state (Figure 1.8). These cages were isolated \\nas the most thermodynamically stable product and typically adopted a tetrahedral \\nstructure. The vertex functionality was shown to have a strong influence on both the \\ncrystal packing and topology of the resulting pore network (Figure 1.8b). For \\nexample, CC1, synthesised from the reaction of TFB and ethylenediamine (EDA), \\nwas formally non-porous to N2 and packed in a window-to-arene fashion with no \\ninterconnected voids. By contrast, CC3, synthesised from the reaction of TFB with \\ncyclohexanediamine (CHDA), was shown to pack window-to-window with a  \\n3-D diamondoid pore network passing though the intrinsic cage voids. This was \\nIntroduction \\n \\n \\n12 \\n \\nrepresented by a BET surface area of 624 m\\n2\\n g\\n-1\\n. The difference in crystal packing \\nand surface area was due to the introduction of the cyclohexane vertex, which forced \\nthe generation of additional extrinsic porosity between the discrete cage molecules \\nand created the observed pore structure.   \\n \\nFigure 1.8 (a) Reaction scheme for the synthesis of cages CC1 – CC3.  \\n(b) Schematic representation of cage-cage packing in the crystal structures of  \\nCC1 – CC3 resulting from a change in the vertex functionality.61 \\nBuilding on this work, the use of different diamine precursors in conjunction with \\nTFB led to a collection of POCs with distinct stoichiometries or properties. For \\nexample, Bojdys et al. showed that the introduction of bulky aryl groups onto the \\ncage vertices frustrated the molecular packing and created additional extrinsic \\nporosity.\\n62\\n One of these cages, CC9, possessed an improved BET surface area, in \\ncomparison to CC3, of 854 m\\n2\\n g\\n-1\\n. In another study using complementary \\nexperimental and computational modelling studies, Jelfs et al. found that with \\nincreasing chain length of alkane diamine precursors, an odd-even effect with respect \\nto the formation of either a [2+3] or [4+6] cage molecule was observable.\\n63\\n  \\nAlteration of the trialdehyde precursor has also proven to have an impact, providing \\nexamples of some of the biggest cage molecules reported to date. The reaction of \\ntri(4-formylphenyl)amine with (R,R)-1,2-cyclopentanediamine gave the [4+6] cage \\nCC5, which was found to have a BET surface area of 1333 m\\n2\\n g\\n-1\\n.\\n64\\n On the other \\nhand, by changing the diamine to (R,R)-1,2-cyclohexanediamine, an [8+12] cage, \\nCC7, was isolated (Figure 1.9).\\n65\\n However, CC7 was found to collapse upon \\nIntroduction \\n \\n \\n13 \\n \\ndesolvation and was therefore non-porous. This alternate behaviour was rationalised \\nto be due to small differences in steric strain between the respective cage vertices, \\nbut it once again shows the importance of diamine choice in the synthesis of POC \\nmolecules. \\n \\nFigure 1.9 (a) Reaction scheme for the synthesis of CC5 and CC7. (b) Single crystal \\nX-ray structures of CC5 (left) and CC7 (right).\\n65\\n \\nCC3 has been repeatedly studied and utilised in many publications by the Cooper \\ngroup over the past few years. In 2011, Jones et al. showed that by combining \\nsolutions of opposing cage enantiomers, highly porous crystalline solids could be \\nprepared in a modular fashion via chiral recognition.\\n64\\n For example, CC3-R could be \\nmixed together with CC1, CC3-S or CC4-S to give porous racemic materials with \\nBET surface areas of up to 980 m\\n2\\n g\\n-1\\n. This concept was later extended by Hasell  \\net al. from a binary to a ternary system.\\n66\\n Hasell et al. also investigated the effect of \\nprecipitation rate upon particle size and morphology, and hence the gas sorption \\nproperties, of different cage racemates, including CC3-R/CC3-S.\\n67\\n It was found that \\nby varying the rate or temperature of mixing, fine control over particle size could be \\nachieved. The most rapidly precipitated samples also showed enhanced gas sorption \\nproperties, with BET surface areas of up to 1000 m\\n2\\n g\\n-1\\n being attained for these \\nheterochiral systems. This observation was rationalised as being due to an increase in \\nthe amorphous character of the material. By running a control experiment on \\nIntroduction \\n \\n \\n14 \\n \\nhomochiral CC3-R to investigate the influence of precipitation rate on the degree of \\ncrystallinity, it was demonstrated in this case that there is a direct link between \\nsurface area and the degree of crystallinity, with highly crystalline CC3 exhibiting a \\nBET surface area of 409 m\\n2\\n g\\n-1\\n. Therefore, the introduction of amorphous character \\ninto these cage materials can result in an increase in the number of defects due to \\ninefficient cage packing, and hence an increase in surface area.  \\n \\nFigure 1.10 (a) Synthesis of scrambled cage products by reaction of TFB with two \\ndifferent diamines. (b) Analytical high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) \\ndata to show the equilibrium distribution of products resulting from the use of \\ndifferent diamine ratios and the associated BET surface areas.\\n68\\n \\nThis phenomenon was exploited by Jiang et al., who revealed that an equilibrium \\ndistribution of POC molecules with mixed vertex functionalities could be produced \\nby reacting different ratios of EDA and CHDA with TFB.\\n68\\n Depending on the ratio \\nused, up to seven cage products ranging in vertex functionality, from pure CC1 to \\nIntroduction \\n \\n \\n15 \\n \\nCC3, could be observed by analytical HPLC. The resultant mixture comprised of \\nPOC molecules of different shapes which packed inefficiently in the solid state, \\nresulting in higher BET surface areas of up to 704 m\\n2\\n g\\n-1\\n being observed upon \\nisolation (Figure 1.10).  \\nThese findings highlight the ease with which the properties of CC3 can be tailored. \\nFurthermore, exploiting the ability of CC3 to dissolve in chlorinated solvents, as \\nwell as its structural stability and defined 3-D diamondoid pore network, has \\nimportant implications with regards to its use in applications, including separations \\nand the formation of composite materials. The interconnected 3-D diamondoid pore \\nnetwork of CC3 has proven extremely important in several studies. Hasell et al. \\nshowed that both iodine and osmium tetroxide guest molecules could be sublimed \\ninto the pore structure and subsequently stabilised.\\n69\\n The pore structure was also \\nshown by Mitra et al. to facilitate the separation of mesitylene from its C9 structural \\nisomer 4-ethyltoluene with total specificity.\\n70\\n Using a chromatography column \\npacked with CC3 crystals, fractions from breakthrough measurements demonstrated \\nthat mesitylene eluted immediately, whereas 4-ethyltoluene was retained in the pore \\nstructure. This observation was reaffirmed by gas chromatography analysis and \\ncomplementary computational simulations. Taking advantage of its solution \\nprocessability, mixed-matrix membranes of CC3 and PIM-1 were prepared by \\nBushell et al. through in-situ crystallisation of the POC molecules from a single \\nhomogeneous solution.\\n71\\n By dispersing CC3 throughout the resulting membrane, its \\nincorporation was determined to enhance the gas permeability, whilst retaining \\nselectivity, and provided better resistance towards physical ageing. An alternative \\napproach to exploit the solubility of CC3 was conducted by Hasell et al., where CC3 \\nwas used to enhance the surface area and microporosity of macroporous inorganic \\nsupports.\\n72\\n Utilising the CC3-R/CC3-S racemate approach discussed above, its \\nincorporation into macroscopic silica beads provided hierarchical porosity and the \\npotential for use in chromatography or sensing. The solubility of CC3 has also \\nenabled it to be induced by a co-solvent to interchange its crystal packing mode \\n(Figure 1.11). Upon slow evaporation of a solution of CC3 in dichloromethane \\n(DCM) and diethyl ether, crystals of CC3 were isolated in which the cage molecules \\npacked in a window-to-arene fashion (β-phase) in preference to the typical low-\\nenergy window-to-window packing mode (α-phase).73 This change was due to \\nIntroduction \\n \\n \\n16 \\n \\nsolvent loss causing the cages to pack in a more frustrated arrangement. Hasell et al. \\nalso demonstrated that the use of 1,4-dioxane could direct the crystal packing of POC \\nmolecules away from their lowest energy polymorphs, this time towards window-to-\\nwindow packing in the formation of 3-D diamondoid pore networks.\\n74\\n \\n \\n \\nFigure 1.11 Schematic representation to show the crystal packing of CC3 in its \\nlower energy α-phase and destabilised β-phase.73 \\nIn 2008, Mastalerz reported the synthesis of an endo-functionalised [4+6] \\nsalicylbisimine cage compound formed via the cycloimination reaction of triptycene \\ntriamine and a salicyldialdehyde (2a, Figure 1.12).\\n56\\n Only in 2011, when its gas \\nsorption properties were analysed, was it found to be highly porous, with a BET \\nsurface area of 1377 m\\n2\\n g\\n-1\\n.\\n75\\n Upon crystallisation from hot dimethyl sulfoxide \\n(DMSO), a second polymorph was found with an improved BET surface area of \\n2071 m\\n2\\n g\\n-1\\n. In its reduced secondary amine form, this cage has been shown to be an \\nideal candidate as an affinity material, with its defined cavity size and shape enabling \\nits use in the detection of aromatic solvent vapours upon deposition onto quartz \\ncrystal microbalances,\\n76\\n as well as in the detection of the drug γ-butyrolactone.77 \\nThis cage has also been shown to be easily modifiable. Schneider et al. investigated \\nthe influence of peripheral groups on the crystal packing and porosity by \\nsynthesising salicyldialdehydes with substituents of varying steric demand and \\nsuccessfully utilising them in POC synthesis (Figure 1.12).\\n78\\n In the crystalline state, \\nand with increased peripheral bulk, the accessible BET surface area was found to \\nsubstantially decrease. This was rationalised as being due to the molecules packing \\nmore tightly together and resulted in the pore windows becoming blocked. In the \\nIntroduction \\n \\n \\n17 \\n \\namorphous state, the BET surface area values for each cage were roughly similar at \\naround 700 m\\n2\\n g\\n-1\\n, with the intrinsic cage cavity having a greater influence on the gas \\nsorption properties. Alternatively, the introduction of various alkyl chains into the \\nintrinsic cage voids via Williamson etherification of the interior hydroxyl groups \\nresulted in “fine-tuning” of the pore structure, with the bulkier substituents taking up \\nmore space and corresponding to lower surface areas.\\n79\\n  \\n \\nFigure 1.12 Reaction scheme for the synthesis of a series of periphery-substituted \\nsalicylbisimine cage compounds.\\n78\\n \\nZhang and co-workers have synthesised a number of organic cages via imine bond \\nformation, with the porous properties subsequently assessed. These shape-persistent \\n3-D prismatic organic cages are typically isolated as amorphous powders due to \\nreduction to secondary amine architectures (Figure 1.13a). They have been shown to \\nexhibit high CO2/N2 selectivities under ambient conditions (36/1 to 138/1, v/v) due to \\na combination of a well-defined cage structure and the strong interaction of CO2 with \\nthe secondary amine groups.\\n80, 81\\n Microwave-assisted Sonogashira coupling of these \\ncages using various diacetylene linkers gave organic-cage frameworks (OCFs) with \\nimproved CO2/N2 selectivity (213/1, v/v).\\n82\\n However, it should be noted that the \\nactual gas uptakes are poor, and this is rationalised to be based on the presence of \\nlong hexyl chains which decrease the accessible pore volume. Interestingly, the \\nintroduction of thioether functionalities into the cage interior has allowed these \\nIntroduction \\n \\n \\n18 \\n \\nmaterials to be used in a functional manner; proving effective in the controlled \\nsynthesis of gold nanoparticles (Figure 1.13c,d).\\n83\\n \\n \\nFigure 1.13 (a) Structure of a prismatic organic cage molecule.\\n80\\n (b) Reaction \\nscheme for the synthesis of an OCF via Sonogashira coupling.\\n82\\n (c) The side view of \\nan artificially inflated model of a thioether functionalised organic cage and (d) the \\nposition of the thioether functionality in the cage.\\n83\\n \\nGiri et al. designed and prepared a range of alkylated organic cages in the pursuit of \\nporous liquid candidates.\\n84\\n From the reaction of (R,R)-1,2-bis(2-hydroxyphenyl)-1,2-\\ndiaminoethane and various aliphatic aldehydes, a range of alkyl-substituted vicinal \\ndiamines were synthesised via consecutive diaza-Cope rearrangement and acidic \\ncleavage steps (Figure 1.14a). Although the alkyl tails could act as spacers in \\ngenerating additional extrinsic porosity in the resulting POC materials, with the \\nisohexyl cage possessing a BET surface area of 289 m\\n2\\n g\\n-1\\n, the non-branched \\nversions could also penetrate adjacent cage cavities; thus reducing the accessible \\nsurface area. Building on this work, using complementary experimental and \\ncomputational studies, Melaugh et al. concluded that the introduction of bulky tert-\\nbutyl terminal branching groups prevented cage penetration, delivering a material \\nwhich may be regarded as a liquid constituting of cages with empty intrinsic \\ncavities.\\n85\\n \\nIntroduction \\n \\n \\n19 \\n \\n \\nFigure 1.14 (a) Reaction scheme for the synthesis of a series of alkylated organic \\ncages.

Analysis of single crystals grown from a chloroform-DMSO solution \\nshowed that it had a large intrinsic cavity (2070 Å\\n3\\n), which is greater than that of \\nCC5 (1356 Å\\n3\\n). However, the cage loses its crystallinity upon activation through \\nheating under vacuum due to the difficulty of removing the large DMSO molecules \\nfrom the pore structure. Subsequent analysis of the cage in its amorphous state \\ndemonstrated that it possessed a BET surface area of 1181 m\\n2\\n g\\n-1\\n, which is still \\namong the highest measured to date.  \\n \\nFigure 1.15 (a) Reaction scheme for the synthesis of a triazine-based [4+6] cage.  \\n(b) Crystal structure of the cage with yellow and red spheres to highlight the interior \\nand exterior cage sizes respectively.\\n86\\n  \\n \\n \\nIntroduction \\n \\n \\n20 \\n \\nBoronate Ester Bond-Based Cages \\nBoronate ester bond formation has previously been shown to be an effective method \\nfor preparing COFs, with its reversible and rigid nature enabling the isolation of \\ncrystalline materials.\\n16\\n Inspired by this, Zhang et al. synthesised a tetraol precursor \\nwhich, when reacted with a triboronic acid, produced a [12+8] cage composed of  \\n24 boronate ester bonds (Figure 1.16).\\n60\\n Upon activation by solvent swapping, the \\nBET surface area was found to be 3758 m\\n2\\n g\\n-1\\n, which is the highest reported for POC \\nmolecules to date. In addition, its internal cavity size was measured to be  \\n2.3 nm, making it the first example of a mesoporous cage. By relocating the alkyl \\nchains in the triptycene precursor from the 13- and 16- positions to the 9- and 10- \\nbridgehead positions, an interlocked catenane structure was formed upon \\ncrystallisation from hexane.\\n87\\n This occurred due to the longer alkyl chains creating \\nadditional attractive dispersion interactions; thus promoting catenane formation. Two \\npores of varying size (1.4 nm and 2.0 nm) were inherent to the pore structure, with \\nthe BET surface area determined to be 1540 m\\n2\\n g\\n-1\\n. \\n \\nFigure 1.16 Reaction scheme to show the synthesis of the [12+8] boronate ester cage \\n3a and the formation of the [24+16] cage catenane 4.\\n87\\n \\nIntroduction \\n \\n \\n21 \\n \\nAnother example based on this methodology was reported by Klotzbach et al., where \\na large molecular cube was constructed from catechol-functionalised \\ntribenzotriquinacene and a 1,4-phenylene diboronic acid.\\n88\\n Although isolated in high \\nyield, the solvent could not be removed without promoting structural collapse, \\nhighlighting the importance of activation conditions in the retention of shape-\\npersistence.  \\nCarbon-Carbon Bond-Based Cages \\nAlthough coveted due to their rigidity and high chemical and thermal stabilities, \\nhistorically, the synthesis of organic cage compounds based on carbon-carbon bonds \\nhas been held back by low overall yields due to their irreversible nature. However, \\nby conducting a three-fold Eglinton homocoupling reaction between two rigid \\nalkyne-terminated building blocks, Avellaneda et al. were able to synthesise a cage \\nas the major product in 20 % yield (Figure 1.17).\\n89\\n Interestingly, upon rapid \\nprecipitation, a kinetically-trapped and crystalline porous polymorph was isolated \\nwith an excellent BET surface area of 1153 m\\n2\\n g\\n-1\\n. Other cages based on this \\narchitecture have been prepared in higher yields, although they have not been \\nevaluated for porosity.\\n90, 91\\n With alkyne metathesis emerging as an alternative \\ndynamic covalent approach, there is further scope for other POCs to be constructed \\nfrom carbon-carbon bonds and in improved yields.  \\n \\nFigure 1.17 Reaction scheme for the synthesis of a carbon-carbon bond-based \\ncage.\\n89\\n \\nIntroduction \\n \\n \\n22 \\n \\n1.4 Gas Separation using Porous Materials \\nAdsorption-based technologies for gas separation have developed rapidly over the \\npast 30 years, potentially offering a more energy-efficient and environmentally-\\nbenign alternative in preference to more traditional approaches such as cryogenic \\ndistillation.\\n7\\n This rise in interest can be correlated with the development of MOFs, \\nwith their structural stabilities, high surface areas, controllable PSDs and adjustable \\nchemical functionalities making them perfect candidates as selective adsorbents.\\n92\\n \\nThe ability to tune the properties of these materials has given rise to the study of a \\nrange of commercially relevant gas separations including, but not limited to:  \\n(i) CO2 capture from gaseous mixtures;\\n93-95\\n (ii) propylene/propene;\\n96\\n (iii) hexane \\nisomers;\\n97\\n (iv) xylene isomers;\\n98\\n and so on. Other amorphous porous materials such \\nas PAFs\\n99\\n and HCPs\\n43\\n have also shown exceptional promise with regards to gas \\nseparation over more traditional porous materials such as zeolites, activated carbon, \\nsilica gel and metal-oxide molecular sieves for example.  \\nAccording to Li et al., gas separation via an adsorptive process is achieved based on \\na difference in the adsorption capability of different gaseous components in an \\nadsorbent, where the performance is determined by the properties of the adsorbent \\nwith regards to both adsorption equilibrium and kinetics.\\n7\\n Most importantly, the \\nadsorbent must exhibit both a good adsorption capacity and selectivity to be \\nconsidered as a candidate for commercial applications. The successful separation of a \\nmixture of gas molecules can be achieved in different manners. Firstly, size/shape \\nexclusion (steric separation) is attained by preventing larger gas molecules from \\nentering the pores and being adsorbed (e.g. separation of hydrocarbons). This is also \\nknown as the molecular sieving effect. Secondly, thermodynamic equilibrium \\nseparation is dependent on the preferential adsorption of one component over another \\n(e.g. C2H2/CO2 separation). The strength of this interaction is dictated by the \\nrespective properties of the adsorbate and adsorbent, including their polarisability or \\ndipole-induced dipole interactions. Finally, kinetic separation is achieved based on a \\ndifference in the diffusion rates of the components in the pore channels, where the \\nadsorbent’s pore size must be finely-tuned between the diameters of the gas \\nmolecules in need of separating (e.g. N2/CH4 separation).\\n7\\n \\nIntroduction \\n \\n \\n23 \\n \\nA gas separation application that has been rarely explored is the separation of xenon \\n(Xe) from krypton (Kr). Due to their similarity in size and shape, inert nature and \\nvery low concentrations in air, the separation of these noble gases has presented a \\ndifficult challenge for materials scientists. Interest in this application has therefore \\nremained low, until recently, when the US Department of Energy began to sponsor \\nresearch and development into alternative technologies for their successful capture \\nand separation.\\n100\\n  \\n1.5 The Separation of Noble Gases using Porous Sorbents and its Potential \\nApplication to the Nuclear Industry \\nNuclear energy is an emission-free source of energy considered as a clean and \\naffordable alternative to the use of non-renewable fossil fuels.\\n101\\n Despite this, there \\nremain considerable safety concerns with this technology, one of which is the release \\nof volatile and hazardous radionuclides. These include radioisotopes of the noble \\ngases xenon (\\n133\\nXe) and krypton (\\n85\\nKr), which are generated during nuclear fission. \\nThey can enter the atmosphere as a consequence of nuclear accidents, such as the \\nFukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant catastrophe in Japan in 2011,\\n102\\n or in process \\noff-gas streams during the reprocessing of used-nuclear fuel (UNF). \\nThe motivations for reprocessing UNF are clear: to minimise the volume of \\nradioactive waste and recover precious isotopes such as plutonium and uranium.\\n101\\n \\nHowever, in countries such as Japan and Russia, the volatile radionuclides generated \\nfrom this process are ultimately released into the atmosphere. In the US, there are no \\nfacilities for the reprocessing of UNF, but the storage of vast and ever-increasing \\namounts of nuclear waste across the country is no longer viewed as a long-term \\nsolution. Hence, for any future reprocessing facility in the US to meet strict licensing \\nrequirements, there needs to be an efficient and affordable technology implemented \\nfor the capture of these volatile radionuclides from the process off-gas streams.\\n100\\n \\nVarious technologies for the capture and separation of Xe and Kr from process off-\\ngas streams have been investigated, with the capture of \\n85\\nKr, amongst other fission \\nand activation products, garnering most attention due to its long half-life  \\n(t1/2 = 10.8 years). An established method which has been previously examined for \\nthis purpose is cryogenic distillation, which is used commercially to separate low \\nconcentrations of Xe (0.087 ppmv) and Kr (1.14 ppmv) from air. This is \\nIntroduction \\n \\n \\n24 \\n \\naccomplished by utilising the differences in boiling points between the gases. In \\nJapan, this technology has been shown to be feasible, with reported Kr \\ndecontamination factors (10 – 1000) which would be expected to meet the \\nanticipated regulatory \\n85\\nKr emission requirements.\\n103\\n On the other hand, this process \\nis both energy-intensive and costly, as the Xe and Kr are only present in low \\nconcentrations, and presents an explosion hazard through the possible radiolytic \\nformation of concentrated ozone. Moreover, optimum \\n85\\nKr decontamination is not \\nalways achieved.\\n100\\n Alternatively, selective absorption can be utilised due to a \\ndifference in solubility between the targeted noble gases in a particular solvent. \\nUsing dichlorodifluoromethane (refrigerant-12), \\n85\\nKr removal efficiencies of up to \\n99.9 % can be reached.\\n104\\n This approach offers low solvent and refrigeration costs, as \\nwell as a reduced explosion hazard, although operating and equipment costs are just \\nas high as for cryogenic distillation. CO2 absorption has also been considered but this \\nprocess is strictly limited to gas streams with high CO2 concentrations.\\n101\\n  \\nRecently, there has been an increasing focus on the use of microporous materials for \\nthe separation of Xe and Kr from air, and from each other, under ambient conditions \\nvia selective physical adsorption. This offers the potential of savings in both energy \\nconsumption and cost. By the time the UNF is reprocessed, Xe will consist of only \\nstable isotopes due to the short half-lives of its radionuclides (e.g. t1/2 = 36.3 days for \\n127\\nXe). However, in process off-gas streams, the concentration of Xe is around 10 \\ntimes higher than Kr, thus the presence of Xe will impact on the capture of \\n85\\nKr, the \\nisotope of regulatory concern, by competing for adsorption sites.\\n105\\n Whereas \\n85\\nKr \\nneeds to be isolated and stored before being potentially released into the atmosphere, \\nthe captured Xe is extremely valuable, and has several industrial applications ranging \\nfrom lighting to medical devices. Therefore, if it can be separated efficiently from \\nKr, it could be potentially recovered for sale, in turn reducing the volume of noble \\ngas waste.\\n101\\n  \\n1.5.1 Xenon Adsorption in Activated Carbon and Zeolites \\nA cheap and commercially available porous sorbent, activated carbon was \\ninvestigated early on for its ability to adsorb and separate noble gases. Munakata  \\net al. studied its performance for binary-component gas mixtures (Kr-Xe and Kr-N2) \\nin the temperature range 77 – 323 K and found that its higher affinity for Xe \\nIntroduction \\n \\n \\n25 \\n \\ninhibited the adsorption of Kr.\\n106\\n This behaviour is unsurprising, as Xe is more \\npolarisable than Kr and experiences a greater interaction with the pore surface; \\ntherefore occupying more adsorption sites. Despite boasting high surface areas and \\nthermal and chemical stabilities, activated carbon is not presently considered to be a \\nviable candidate for noble gas separation, as it poses a significant fire-risk due to the \\npresence of incompatible NOx in the process off-gas streams.  \\nAlternatively, several commercially-available zeolites were studied by Jameson et \\nal.\\n107\\n Utilising \\n129\\nXe NMR spectroscopy and grand canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) \\nsimulations, it was found that the zeolites NaA and NaX were selective for Xe over \\nKr, with selectivity values in the range 4 – 6 calculated using ideal adsorbed solution \\ntheory (IAST). The influence of silver (Ag) nanoparticle loading in zeolites has also \\nbeen examined, as their presence has been hypothesised to polarise the noble gas \\natoms and enhance the adsorption capacity.\\n108-110\\n For example, a silver-exchanged \\nzeolite, Ag-ETS-10, was shown to exhibit an enhanced Xe adsorption capacity, with \\nhigh isosteric heats of adsorption observed in comparison to a sodium-exchanged \\nzeolite Na-ETS-10.\\n111\\n \\nAlthough there have been advances regarding the ability to tune the porous \\nproperties of zeolites,\\n112\\n like activated carbon, they cannot match the reticular \\napproach to the synthesis of MOFs, where the properties can be fine-tuned by \\nconstructing extended frameworks of novel chemical compositions, pore sizes and \\nstructural stabilities. \\n1.5.2 MOFs for the Capture and Separation of Xenon from Krypton \\nThe applicability of MOFs was first reported by Mueller et al.,\\n113\\n where it was \\ninitially found that containers filled with IRMOF-1 had higher adsorption capacities \\nfor Xe and Kr compared to empty containers. A breakthrough system loaded with \\nHKUST-1 was then shown to purify a 94:6 molar ratio of Kr and Xe to 99 % Kr, \\nwith less than 50 ppm of Xe remaining. Following this study, Thallapally et al. \\nutilised Ni/DOBDC and revealed that it outperformed both activated carbon and \\nIRMOF-1; achieving a higher Xe uptake (4.2 mmol g\\n-1\\n, 55 wt %) and selectivity for \\nXe over Kr at room temperature.\\n114\\n These observations were rationalised based on \\nthe pore structure of Ni/DOBDC: a large number of open metal sites within uniform \\nhexagonal pore channels (11 Å).\\n115\\n The only mechanism for Xe to interact with the \\nIntroduction \\n \\n \\n26 \\n \\npore surface is through its polarisability and as metal cations are very polarising, they \\nenhance the interaction with the noble gas. By comparison, activated carbon and \\nIRMOF-1 contain no open metal sites.  \\nTo complement and aid these initial experimental studies, there have been a number \\nof computational reports which have investigated the adsorption properties of both \\nexisting and hypothetical MOF structures in relation to noble gas separation.\\n116-119\\n \\nThese have provided valuable insights into deciphering the ideal framework structure \\nfor Xe/Kr separation that exhibits both high adsorption capacity and selectivity.  \\nRyan et al. used GCMC simulations to screen a variety of well-known MOFs of \\nvarying topologies, pore sizes and metal atoms to determine the ideal structural \\ncharacteristics required for Xe/Kr separation.\\n120\\n It was concluded that the presence of \\nsmall pores with strong adsorption sites induced the desired adsorption of Xe over \\nKr, with MOF-505 found to exhibit the best combination of capacity and selectivity. \\nBuilding on this work, Sikora et al. used high-throughput computational screening of \\n137,000 hypothetical MOFs to find that the best-performing materials for Xe/Kr \\nseparation contained tube-like pores which were just large enough to fit a single Xe \\natom.\\n121\\n They also determined that significantly improved materials remain to be \\nsynthesised and evaluated. These observations have also been supported through \\nother computational approaches. Gurdal and Keskin used GCMC and equilibrium \\nmolecular dynamics (MD) simulations to calculate adsorption isotherms and self-\\ndiffusivities of Xe/Kr mixtures in ten different MOFs.\\n122\\n Those MOFs with the \\nhighest adsorption selectivities possessed narrow pores, which were found to \\npromote stronger Xe confinement. By investigating the effect of open metal sites \\nthrough running both experimental and simulation experiments on the nbo- and \\nM/DOBDC series of MOFs, Perry et al. established that target structures should have \\na high density of metal sites with pore dimensions approaching the size of the gas of \\ninterest.\\n123\\n  \\nOne issue with some of these computational approaches is that the selectivities for \\nthermodynamic mixture adsorption are typically calculated from single-component \\nisotherms. When examining the capture of Xe and Kr from process off-gas streams, \\nnot only do you need to consider the presence of other gases (N2, O2, CO2, Ar) \\ncompeting for adsorption sites, but also their diffusion rates within the material.\\n118\\n \\nThis is of particular relevance to Xe/Kr separation, where Xe has a higher \\nIntroduction \\n \\n \\n27 \\n \\npolarisability but a lower diffusivity in comparison to Kr. While the thermodynamic \\neffect is solely based on adsorbate-adsorbent interactions, the kinetic effect  \\n(i.e. diffusion rate) is determined by many factors, such as:\\n7\\n (i) the relationship \\nbetween the size and shape of the adsorbate versus the size and shape of the \\nadsorbent’s pore; (ii) the strength of adsorption; (iii) the affinity of the adsorbate \\ntowards the adsorption site; (iv) the concentration of the adsorbed species, and; (v) \\nthe system temperature. Therefore, any experimental study needs to address both the \\nthermodynamic and kinetic selectivities, whereby not only is the adsorption \\nperformance considered, but also the kinetic behaviour of the gas molecules within \\nthe material itself. \\n \\nTo satisfy this, Liu et al. used a dynamic breakthrough column method at room \\ntemperature to study Xe and Kr adsorption.\\n124\\n Two MOFs were selected due to their \\ndifferent pore morphologies (Figure 1.18). Ni/DOBDC had been previously shown to \\nadsorb a large amount of Xe with selectivity over Kr.\\n114\\n With its uniform cylindrical \\npores and open metal sites, it satisfied some of the desired characteristics for Xe/Kr \\nseparation identified by simulation studies. Alternatively, HKUST-1 contains open \\nmetal sites but also has three different types of connected cavities: cages with \\ndimensions of 11 Å and 13 Å, as well as small tetrahedral-shaped cavities with a \\ndiameter of 5 Å.\\n125\\n Using Xe/Kr mixtures of different compositions (80:20, 50:50 \\nand 20:80), Ni/DOBDC was shown to outperform HKUST-1, as well as activated \\ncarbon, for all compositions. These results were rationalised on the basis of its pore \\nstructure. While the high density of open metal sites in Ni/DOBDC predisposed Xe \\nto interact more strongly due to its higher polarisability and ensure a higher Xe/Kr \\nselectivity, Ryan et al. found through simulation studies that both Xe and Kr prefer \\nto adsorb in or around the small pockets of HKUST-1, leading to higher Kr uptakes \\nin relation to Xe and therefore lower selectivities.\\n120\\n Liu et al. also ran breakthrough \\nmeasurements for low concentrations of Xe (400 ppm) and Kr (40 ppm) in simulated \\nair; thus mirroring the conditions that would be encountered in the reprocessing of \\nUNF.\\n124\\n It was found that Ni/DOBDC could successfully separate ppm levels of Xe \\nfrom Kr in air and achieved a selectivity of 7.3. \\nIntroduction \\n \\n \\n28 \\n \\n \\n \\nFigure 1.18 Crystal structures of Ni/DOBDC (left) and HKUST-1 (right) to illustrate \\ntheir different pore morphologies.\\n124\\n \\nThe influence of Ag nanoparticles, which enhanced Xe adsorption in Ag-loaded \\nzeolites, was also investigated for Ni/DOBDC.\\n126\\n By fine-tuning the Ag-loading \\nmass whilst retaining a high surface area, Ag@Ni/DOBDC had an improved Xe \\nuptake capacity (70 wt %) and thermodynamic Xe/Kr selectivity (6.8) compared to \\nthe unadulterated Ni/DOBDC sample. This was rationalised based on the strong \\ndipole-induced dipole interaction between the adsorbed Xe atoms and the Ag \\nnanoparticles within the pores.  \\nMOF-505 was previously identified by Ryan et al. to be a promising material for \\nXe/Kr separation due to its ideal combination of small pores and strong adsorption \\nsites (Figure 1.19).\\n120\\n Bae et al. used breakthrough measurements to verify these \\ncomputational predictions.\\n127\\n Conducted at room temperature using a Xe/Kr mixture \\n(20:80) which is representative of the composition used industrially, MOF-505 was \\nfound to have a Xe/Kr selectivity of 9 – 10, which outperformed Ni/DOBDC and \\nmatched well with complementary simulation studies. It also exhibited a higher Xe \\nuptake at 0.2 bar in comparison to Ni/DOBDC, with its superior properties attributed \\nto the pore confinement effect of its small pores (4.8 Å, 7.1 Å and 9.5 Å) and its \\naccessible metal centres serving as strong adsorption sites.\\n127\\n This study also \\nhighlighted how simulated and experimental measurements can deviate due to either \\ninappropriate fittings used during the simulation studies, or through sample \\nvariability arising from the preparation and activation procedures. Therefore, a \\ncomplementary approach between experimental and simulated measurements must \\nbe followed to maximise understanding of the desired properties required for Xe/Kr \\nseparation.  \\nIntroduction \\n \\n \\n29 \\n \\n \\nFigure 1.19 Framework structure of MOF-505.\\n127\\n \\nMore recently, the microporous MOF Co3(HCOO)6, which contains 1-D channels of \\nrepeating zig-zag segments and a pore diameter of 5 – 6 Å, was found by  \\nWang et al. to possess a high Xe adsorption capacity (2.0 mmol g\\n-1\\n, 28 wt %) and \\nXe/Kr selectivity (6) when calculated from breakthrough experiments using a Xe/Kr \\nmixture (10:90) at room temperature.\\n128\\n These observations were rationalised by \\nsimulations, whereby each Xe atom was found to fit within a segment and interact \\nwith the formate groups on the pore surface (Figure 1.20); this resulted in \\ncommensurate adsorption.\\n101\\n The introduction of different metals, including \\nmanganese and nickel, had no effect on the uptake and selectivity. This feature \\nvalidates the findings of Perry et al.,\\n123\\n who demonstrated that changing the identity \\nof the transition metal centre in the M/DOBDC series of MOFs\\n129\\n did not lead to any \\nenhanced properties. This was due to the formal charge and the nature of the \\ninteraction remaining the same across the series.\\n101\\n  \\n \\nFigure 1.20 Top view of the Co3(HCOO)6 framework along the b-axis (left) and an \\nimage produced from the simulation of Xe adsorption at 298 K and 1 bar showing \\ncommensurate packing of Xe atoms (blue spheres) within the zig-zag channels \\n(right).\\n128\\n \\nIntroduction \\n \\n \\n30 \\n \\nThe selectivity can also be switched in favour of Kr by utilising MOFs with pore \\nsizes small enough to promote a “molecular-sieving” effect.118 FMOF-Cu comprises \\na pore structure containing tubular cavities (5.1 Å \\uf0b4 5.1 Å), along with bottleneck \\nwindows with estimated dimensions of 3.5 Å \\uf0b4 3.5 Å (Figure 1.21). Based on the \\nrespective diameters of Kr (3.69 Å) and Xe (4.10 Å), it would be expected that Kr \\nwould be selectively adsorbed over Xe (termed “reverse selectivity”). Indeed, at \\ntemperatures below 273 K, Fernandez et al. found that more Kr is adsorbed in \\ncomparison to Xe.\\n130\\n This behaviour was ascribed to a temperature-dependent gating \\neffect, whereby the decreasing flexibility of the windows restricted the diffusion of \\nXe molecules inside the pore channels, with the kinetic effect outperforming the \\nthermodynamic one. Alternatively, the selectivity can be switched in favour of Xe by \\nraising the temperature above 298 K. This is due to the windows expanding and the \\ngas molecules diffusing more readily, resulting in the thermodynamic effect \\nbecoming more dominant. \\n \\nFigure 1.21 Crystal structure of FMOF-Cu.\\n101\\n  \\nThe ability of FMOF-Cu to selectively adsorb Kr over Xe led Liu et al. to develop a \\ntwo-column method for the separation of Xe and Kr from process off-gas streams.\\n105\\n \\nUsing breakthrough measurements at 233 K and the same gas mixture of Xe  \\n(400 ppm) and Kr (40 ppm) in simulated air utilised in previous studies,\\n124\\n the Xe \\nwas initially removed selectively from the mixture stream by loading the first bed \\nwith Ni/DOBDC. By subsequently passing the left-over gas stream through a second \\nbed containing FMOF-Cu, the removal efficiency and adsorption capacity for Kr was \\ngreatly improved, as it was no longer competing with Xe for adsorption sites.\\n105\\n \\nIntroduction \\n \\n \\n31 \\n \\n1.5.3 Outlook for Noble Gas Separation using Porous Sorbents \\nOf the porous materials discussed so far, MOFs have shown the greatest promise for \\nthe capture and separation of Xe and Kr from process off-gas streams during the \\nreprocessing of UNF. Based on the experimental and computational studies \\npublished to date, according to Banerjee et al., it has become clear that the ideal \\nmaterial for Xe/Kr separation should exhibit one or more of the following \\nproperties:\\n101\\n (i) a high concentration of open metal sites on the pore surface;  \\n(ii) narrow pores of uniform width which are large enough to accommodate a single \\nXe atom; (iii) contain polarised nanoparticles within the pore structure, and;  \\n(iv) facilitate the temperature-dependent separation of the gas mixture. Comparing \\nthe best performing materials to date also demonstrates that a high surface area is not \\nessential for enhanced Xe/Kr selectivity (Table 1.1), although overall uptake is still \\nimportant in terms of commercial applicability.  \\nTable 1.1 Comparison of Xe uptake and Xe/Kr selectivity from breakthrough \\nmeasurements (Xe/Kr, 20:80) at 298 K and 1 bar for selected porous materials.\\n128\\n \\nMaterial SABET / \\n m\\n2 \\ng\\n-1\\n \\nXe Uptake (298 K) /  \\nmmol g\\n-1\\n \\nXe/Kr  \\nSelectivity \\n \\nNi/DOBDC\\n114\\n \\n \\n950 \\n \\n4.2 \\n \\n~ 4.0\\n124\\n \\nAg@Ni/DOBDC\\n126 \\n750 ~ 4.9  -  \\nHKUST-1\\n124\\n 1710 3.2 2.6  \\nFMOF-Cu\\n130\\n 58 ~ 0.5 ~ 2.0\\na\\n  \\nCo3(HCOO)6\\n128\\n 300 ~ 2.0 6.0\\nb \\nMOF-505\\n127\\n 1030 2.2*  9 – 10  \\n \\na\\nFrom breakthrough measurement (Xe/Kr, 50:50); \\nb\\nfrom breakthrough measurement \\n(Xe/Kr, 10:90). *Xe uptake measured at 0.2 bar.  \\n \\nFinding a material that encompasses all of these aspects will prove challenging. \\nTherefore, uniting both experimental and computational approaches will be \\nimportant in the search for new and superior materials.

Through synthetic modification of both the trialdehyde \\nand diamine precursors, the gas sorption properties of the resultant cages can be \\nfinely-tuned, resulting in enhanced properties with respect to both gas storage and \\nselectivity. \\nChapter 3, Synthesis of an Asymmetric Porous Organic Cage, presents the \\npreparation and utilisation of a derivative of the cage precursor triformylbenzene in \\nthe synthesis and isolation of a porous organic cage of reduced symmetry. \\nComplementary gas sorption kinetics and molecular dynamics simulations \\ndemonstrate the potential of this cage for use in noble gas separation.  \\nChapter 4, Synthesis of Periphery-Substituted Porous Organic Cages, presents the \\npreparation of enantiomerically-pure cyclohexanediamine derivatives and their \\nsuccessful utilisation in porous organic cage synthesis. The effect of introducing \\nfunctional groups of varying steric and electronic characteristics on the gas sorption \\nproperties of the resulting cages is investigated, as well as a rare demonstration of the \\npost-synthetic modification of an imine bond-based cage molecule. A large [8+12] \\ncage molecule possessing bulky cage vertices was also successfully synthesised and \\ncharacterised, with its shape-persistence and stability subsequently evaluated. \\nChapter 5, Separation of Xenon from Krypton using Porous Organic Cages, presents \\nthe use of dynamic breakthrough measurements to assess the ability of porous \\norganic cages to selectively separate Xe from Kr under conditions mimicking those \\nexperienced in the reprocessing of used-nuclear fuel. \\n1.7 References \\n1.

For CC14 and CC16 – 19, volumetric adsorption \\nisotherms using N2 gas were run to determine the surface areas and PSDs of both \\namorphous and crystalline samples, where appropriate. Other relevant gases  \\n(H2 and CO2) were also analysed, as well as Xe and Kr for CC14. Gravimetric \\nadsorption isotherms for Xe and Kr for the powder samples of CC1β and CC3 were \\nanalysed in order to make direct comparisons with the uptake values obtained from \\npreviously run volumetric adsorption isotherms. Dynamic breakthrough \\nmeasurements for samples of CC1β and CC3 in their pellet form were conducted to \\nexamine the ability of these porous materials to separate Xe from Kr at industrially-\\nrelevant concentrations. \\n2.1.1 Gas Adsorption Theory \\nThe term adsorption is used to describe the process by which a molecule  \\n(the adsorbate) forms a bond to the surface (the adsorbent).\\n1\\n In the interests of this \\nwork, the adsorbate consists of gaseous molecules, while the adsorbent is a porous \\nmaterial consisting of discrete organic cage molecules. To characterise the properties \\nof a particular porous material, gas adsorption measurements are used to determine \\nits surface area, PSD and pore size.  \\nAdsorption is a spontaneous and exothermic process and can be split into two \\ncategories: physisorption and chemisorption. In physisorption, no chemical bond is \\nformed, with the interaction arising from weak van der Waals forces between the gas \\nmolecules and the surface. As the bonding is generally fragile, it tends to be a \\nreversible process, with the adsorbate layer in equilibrium with the molecules of the \\ngas phase.\\n1\\n All gases physisorb below their condensation temperature. On the other \\nhand, chemisorption involves electron transfer, resulting in the formation of a true \\nchemical bond between the adsorbate and the surface. This is distinguished from \\nphysisorption by its higher heat of adsorption. Whilst chemisorption is limited to the \\nformation of a single layer (monolayer) of adsorbates on the surface, physisorption \\nalso allows the formation of multilayers, providing the pores of the material are large \\nenough to facilitate this.   \\nCharacterisation Methods \\n \\n \\n41 \\n \\n2.1.2 Langmuir Adsorption Model \\nThere are two major models which describe the adsorption of gaseous molecules to a \\nsurface, the first of which is the Langmuir adsorption model.\\n2\\n The Langmuir \\nisotherm is used to determine the total surface area, but applies only to monolayer \\nadsorption and involves a number of assumptions which paradoxically may not be \\nrelevant to actual porous materials:\\n1\\n \\n1. All adsorption sites are equivalent and may be occupied by only one \\nadsorbate molecule \\n2. A dynamic equilibrium exists between the molecules in the gas phase and the \\nadsorbed layer  \\n3. If an adsorbate molecule collides with a vacant adsorption site, it forms a \\nbond with the surface, whereas if a filled site is struck, it is reflected back into \\nthe gas phase \\n4. Once adsorbed, the molecules are localised, with the interactions between \\nother adsorbate molecules on adjacent sites discounted. \\nTo determine the specific surface area using the Langmuir model (SAlang), it must \\nfirst be assumed that the molecules in the gas phase are in dynamic equilibrium with \\nthe surface: \\nM(g) + S(surface site) ⇌ M – S          (2.1) \\nAs this is an equilibrium process, the equilibrium constant K is a function of ka and \\nkd, which are the rate constants for adsorption and desorption respectively: \\nK = \\nka\\nkd\\n          (2.2) \\nIf Ns is the number of sites occupied by the adsorbate and N is the total number of \\nsurface adsorption sites (the monolayer capacity), the fractional coverage of the \\nadsorbate is defined as: \\n\\uf071 = \\nNs\\nN\\n          (2.3) \\nThe rate of adsorption is dependent on the pressure P, as well as the fractional \\nmonolayer coverage of sites which are not occupied by adsorbate molecules (1 – \\uf071), \\nCharacterisation Methods \\n \\n \\n42 \\n \\nwhereas the rate of desorption is independent of the pressure and depends only on the \\nfractional monolayer coverage: \\nRate of adsorption = kaP(1 – \\uf071)          (2.4) \\nRate of desorption = kd\\uf071          (2.5) \\nDespite this alternate dependence, P does determine \\uf071 to an extent; hence, there is an \\n“indirect” influence on the rate of adsorption. Therefore, at equilibrium, both the rate \\nof adsorption and desorption are equal: \\nkaP(1 – \\uf071) = kd\\uf071          (2.6) \\nUpon rearrangement, Equation 2.7 gives the Langmuir adsorption isotherm for \\nassociative adsorption, which predicts how the fractional monolayer coverage of the \\nadsorbate changes with pressure. This may also be defined in terms of relative \\namounts or relative volumes, as well as the relative number of molecules: \\n\\uf071 = \\nNs\\nN\\n = \\nna\\nnm\\n = \\nVa\\nVm\\n = \\nKP\\n1 + KP\\n          (2.7) \\nwhere na is the amount of gas adsorbed, nm is the amount of gas adsorbed \\ncorresponding to all adsorption sites being occupied in the monolayer, Va is the \\nvolume of gas adsorbed at constant P and Vm is the volume of gas adsorbed at \\nconstant P corresponding to all adsorption sites being occupied in the monolayer. \\nThe Langmuir equation can then be rewritten in the linear form as: \\nP\\nna\\n = \\n1\\nnmK\\n + \\nP\\nnm\\n          (2.8) \\nThe plot of P/na against P will give a straight line of gradient 1/nm. The specific \\nsurface area can then be calculated using: \\nSAlang = nmLam          (2.9) \\nwhere am is the cross-sectional area of one molecule and L is Avogadro’s number \\n(6.022\\uf0b41023 mol-1). \\n \\nCharacterisation Methods \\n \\n \\n43 \\n \\n2.1.3 Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) Adsorption Model  \\nThe BET adsorption model is now widely applied to determine a material’s surface \\narea and other porous properties.\\n3\\n It overcomes the restriction of the Langmuir model \\nby allowing for multilayer formation. Initial monolayer adsorption occurs with a \\nfixed heat of adsorption, whilst subsequent multilayer formation differs significantly \\nin value, as the strength of adsorbate-adsorbent bonds differs from that of adsorbate-\\nadsorbate bonds. In accordance with a number of simplified assumptions, the \\nLangmuir model can be applied to each adsorption layer to give the BET equation, \\nwhich in its linear form is defined as: \\nP\\nV(P0 - P)\\n = \\n1\\nVmC\\n + \\n(C - 1)\\nVmC\\n . \\nP\\nP0\\n          (2.10) \\nThe adsorption of N2 gas at 77 K and 1 bar is generally employed to determine the \\nspecific BET surface area (SABET) exhibited by a porous material. Using this in \\nrelation to Equation 2.10, P is the pressure of N2 applied, P0 is the saturated gas \\npressure of N2 at 77 K, V is the total volume of N2 gas adsorbed, Vm is the volume of \\ngas adsorbed on the monolayer and C is a constant which takes account of the \\nenthalpies of adsorption. Plotting P/V(P0 – P) against P/P0 gives a linear plot, where \\nvalues for the gradient (C – 1)/VmC and intercept 1/VmC can be obtained. These \\nvalues are used to determine Vm, the value of which is then utilised to calculate the \\ntotal surface area:\\n4\\n \\nSA = \\namVmL\\nV0\\n          (2.11) \\nwhere am is the cross-sectional area of one molecule of N2 (16.2\\uf0b410\\n-20\\n m\\n2\\n), L is \\nAvogadro’s number (6.022\\uf0b41023 mol-1) and V0 is the molar volume of N2 gas  \\n(22.4 dm\\n3\\n mol\\n-1\\n) at standard temperature and pressure.  \\nThe specific BET surface area can then be calculated by dividing this value by the \\nmass of the adsorbent. It should be noted that the isotherm is only valid in the range  \\nP/P0 = 0.05 – 0.3, as outside of this range it is not linear.  \\n \\n \\nCharacterisation Methods \\n \\n \\n44 \\n \\n2.1.4 Gas Adsorption Isotherm Classification \\nThe majority of physisorption isotherms can be classified into six different categories \\n(Figure 2.1). Type I isotherms are reversible and typically correspond to the filling of \\nmicropores. This is demonstrated by a large gas uptake at low relative pressures, \\nwhich then approaches saturation at higher relative pressures. The reversible Type II \\nisotherm is generally obtained for macroporous adsorbents, where unrestricted \\nmonolayer-multilayer adsorption can occur.\\n5\\n Point B in Figure 2.1-II indicates the \\nstage at which monolayer coverage is complete and multilayer adsorption begins. \\nThe Type III isotherm is also reversible. Behaviour of this type is relatively rare, \\nwith low gas uptake at low relative pressures indicating a weak interaction between \\nthe adsorbate and adsorbent. Type IV isotherms are characterised by a “hysteresis \\nloop” and are typically observed for mesoporous adsorbents. At low relative \\npressures, it follows the same behaviour as the Type II isotherm. Conversely, larger \\nvolumes are adsorbed at higher relative pressures due to capillary condensation \\nwithin the mesopores. The Type V isotherm is uncommon and difficult to interpret, \\nwhereas the Type VI isotherm represents stepwise multilayer adsorption, with each \\n“step” corresponding to the completion of each separate monolayer.1 \\n \\nFigure 2.1 Illustrations to show the different types of physisorption isotherms (left) \\nand hysteresis loops (right).\\n5\\n \\nCharacterisation Methods \\n \\n \\n45 \\n \\nHysteresis is usually associated with capillary condensation in mesoporous \\nadsorbents. It appears as a “loop” in the isotherm and may exhibit a variety of shapes \\n(Figure 2.1). Type H1 is often related to porous materials with uniform and narrow \\nPSDs, and is characterised by vertical adsorption and desorption curves which are \\nalmost parallel to one another.\\n5\\n On the other hand, Type H2 loops are typical of \\nporous adsorbents where the distribution of pore size and shape is not uniform.  \\nType H3 and H4 loops are observed for porous adsorbents with slit-shaped pores, \\nwith Type H4 often associated with narrow pores and hence microporous solids \\nexhibiting a Type I adsorption isotherm. \\n2.1.5 Volumetric Gas Adsorption Measurements \\nSurface areas for all POC molecules were measured by N2 adsorption at 77 K and  \\n1 bar. Powder samples were degassed offline at 373 K for 15 hours under dynamic \\nvacuum (10\\n-5\\n bar) before analysis, followed by degassing on the analysis port under \\nvacuum, also at 373 K. Isotherms were measured using Micromeritics 2020 or 2420 \\nvolumetric adsorption analysers. N2 and H2 isotherms were maintained at 77 K by \\nliquid nitrogen cooling. Higher temperature isotherms for CO2 (273 K) and Xe and \\nKr (298 K) required a circulating water chiller/heater to maintain the temperature. \\nPSDs were derived from the adsorption branches of the isotherms using the non-local \\ndensity functional theory (NL-DFT) model within the Micromeritics ASAP software. \\nXe kinetics measurements for CC3 and CC14 were performed using a Micromeritics \\n3flex surface characterisation analyser. Isotherms for CC3 and CC14, using samples \\nof the same mass, were recorded in parallel. By recording the decrease in pressure as \\na function of time, after dosing at equivalent pressure steps, a comparison between \\nthe samples could be made. All measurements were carried out using high purity \\ngases: N2 (N5.0: 99.999 % - BOC gases); H2, CO2, Xe and Kr (N5.5: 99.9995 % - \\nBOC gases). \\n2.1.6 Gravimetric Gas Adsorption Measurements \\nStatic Xe and Kr adsorption isotherms of the powder samples of CC1β and CC3 \\nwere performed gravimetrically using an Intelligence Gravimetric Analyser (IGA) \\nfrom Hiden Instruments. Prior to analysis, the samples were degassed by heating at \\n413 K under vacuum for 10 hours. Both Xe and Kr adsorption isotherms were \\nCharacterisation Methods \\n \\n \\n46 \\n \\nmeasured at 298 K under IGA water bath control using the static mode. Pure Xe and \\nKr were purchased from OXARC, Inc. (Spokane, WA) and used as received. \\n2.1.7 Xe/Kr Breakthrough Measurements  \\nTo minimise pressure drop and prevent potential contamination of the main gas \\npipelines, pellet samples for each cage were formed following a two-step procedure. \\nFirstly, a powder sample was pressed into a disk under 9 MPa for 3 minutes. The \\ndisk was then carefully broken up using a pestle and mortar and the fragments were \\nsieved for 20 – 30 mesh (600 – 850 μm) pellets. The two-step procedure was \\nrepeated to make more pellets when necessary.   \\nThe Xe and Kr breakthrough curves were measured for CC1β and CC3 using a \\ndynamic sorption analyser (ARBC, Hiden Analytical Ltd., Warrington, U.K.).\\n6\\n The \\n600 – 850 μm cage pellets were packed into an adsorption bed for the breakthrough \\nexperiments. With reference to the ARBC system illustrated in Figure 2.2, the gases \\nwere introduced through the bottom inlet of the adsorption bed. The adsorption bed \\nwas held between two layers of quartz wool and two sample holders, with frit gaskets \\ninstalled at both the top and bottom ends of the adsorption bed to further prevent any \\npotential powder contamination of the pipelines.  \\n \\nFigure 2.2 Apparatus for Xe/Kr breakthrough measurements.\\n7\\n  \\nIn a typical pure Xe or Kr breakthrough experiment, a gas mixture with a total flow \\nrate of 20 sccm (standard cubic centimetres per minute) and a total pressure of 1 bar \\nwas flowed through the adsorption bed. For a Xe/Kr mixture breakthrough \\nexperiment, a total flow rate of 40 sccm and a total pressure of 1 bar were used. For \\nCharacterisation Methods \\n \\n \\n47 \\n \\nthe separation of Xe (400 ppm) and Kr (40 ppm) in simulated air, a total flow rate of \\n40 sccm and a total pressure of 1 bar were used. \\nPrior to a specific sequence of breakthrough experiments for each cage, the pellet \\nsample was degassed by heating at 413 K in situ under a He purge for 10 hours. In \\nbetween breakthrough experiments, the sample was again purged with He, and the \\ngas lines were purged with a gas mixture comprised of the same composition and \\ntotal flow rate as that in the next measurement. The samples were then regenerated \\nunder a He purge at room temperature for 200 minutes and purged with He \\nimmediately before commencing the breakthrough experiment. This procedure was \\napplied to all the samples tested. Dead volume and delay in the mass spectrometer \\nsignal were considered and deducted from the measured breakthrough capacities. \\nThe activated sample weight was determined immediately after unloading the sample \\nand the ideal gas law was used to calculate the moles of gas adsorbed by the cage \\nsamples.\\n7\\n \\nBased on the mass balance, the gas adsorption properties can be determined as \\nfollows: \\nq = \\nC0Vts\\n22.4W\\n           (2.12) \\nts = ∫ (1 - \\nF\\nF0\\n)\\nt\\n0\\n dt          (2.13) \\nwhere ts is the stoichiometric time (min), C0 is the feed gas concentration, F0 and F \\nare the inlet and outlet gas molar flow rates respectively, q is the equilibrium \\nadsorption capacity of gas (mmol g\\n-1\\n), t is the adsorption time (min) which is from \\ntime zero to time when equilibrium is reached, V is the volumetric feed flow rate \\n(cm\\n3\\n min\\n-1\\n) at standard temperature and pressure (273 K and 1 atm) and W is the \\nweight of the activated adsorbent (g).\\n6\\n \\nThe respective dynamic capacities of Xe and Kr, determined using Equations 2.12 \\nand 2.13, can be used to calculate the Xe/Kr selectivity using the standard definition:  \\nSAB = \\nxA / yA\\nxB / yB\\n           (2.14) \\n \\nCharacterisation Methods \\n \\n \\n48 \\n \\nwhere xA and xB are the mole fractions of gases A and B in the adsorbed phase and yA \\nand yB are the mole fractions of gases A and B in the bulk phase. \\nPure He, Xe and Kr were purchased from OXARC, Inc. (Spokane, WA) and used as \\nreceived. The low concentration Xe (400 ppm) and Kr (40 ppm) mixtures in \\nsimulated air were also purchased from the same company and used as received. \\n2.2 X-ray Diffraction Theory and Measurements  \\nX-ray diffraction is the most accurate method for characterising the structure of \\ncrystalline materials. In addition to providing information on the phase-purity of the \\nmaterial, it can precisely determine the atomic positions, bond lengths and bond \\nangles of the molecules within the unit cell: providing an overall, average picture of a \\nlong-range ordered structure.\\n8 \\nX-rays are a form of electromagnetic radiation with \\nwavelengths in the range 0.01 nm to 10 nm, and are typically generated as a result of \\nthe impact of high-energy electrons with a metal target.\\n9\\n  \\n \\nFigure 2.3 Illustration of Bragg diffraction.\\n10\\n \\nCrystalline solids consist of regular arrays of atoms, ions or molecules with \\ncharacteristic interatomic spacings. Diffraction occurs when the wavelength of the  \\nX-ray is of the same order of magnitude as the interatomic spacing (Figure 2.3).\\n8\\n At \\nspecific orientations, X-rays are “reflected” from these atomic planes. The reflected \\nbeams may arrive in phase with one another, also known as constructive interference, \\nCharacterisation Methods \\n \\n \\n49 \\n \\nand for this to take place, the path lengths of the interfering beams must differ by an \\nintegral number of wavelengths.\\n8\\n This gives rise to the Bragg equation: \\n \\nnλ = 2dsin\\uf071          (2.15) \\n \\nwhere n is the number of wavelengths, λ is the wavelength, d is the spacing between \\nthe atomic planes and \\uf071 is the diffraction angle between incoming and outgoing  \\nX-ray beams. \\nUsing Bragg’s Law, the resulting diffraction pattern can be interpreted to provide \\ninformation on the structural properties of the crystalline solid, including the size of \\nthe unit cell or its symmetry for example.  \\n2.2.1 Single Crystal X-ray Diffraction (scXRD) \\nscXRD involves measuring the position and intensity of each reflection to precisely \\ndetermine the unit cell dimensions, space group and positions of the atoms and \\nchemical bonds.\\n8\\n The diffraction pattern generated is a transformation of the atomic \\nstructure into reciprocal space, with the 3-D distribution of atoms restored after \\ntransforming back into direct space via the application of a Fourier transform, \\nwhereby the atomic positions can be determined according to the distribution of \\nelectron density.\\n9\\n scXRD was used primarily to confirm the chemical structure and \\nstoichiometry of cages CC14, CC16, CC17 and CC19. In addition, where relevant, \\nit enabled analysis of their solid state packing modes in order to help rationalise their \\nrespective gas sorption properties. \\nscXRD data sets for CC14, CC16 and CC19 were measured on a Rigaku \\nMicroMax-007 HF rotating anode diffractometer (Mo-Kα radiation, λ = 0.71073 Å, \\nKappa 4-circle goniometer, Rigaku Saturn724+ detector), or, where specified, at \\nBeamline I19, Diamond Light Source, Didcot, UK, using silicon double crystal \\nmonochromated radiation (λ = 0.6889 Å, Rigaku Saturn724+ detector).11 scXRD \\ndata sets for CC17 were measured on a Bruker D8 Venture Advance diffractometer \\nequipped with IμS microfocus source (Cu-Kα radiation, λ = 1.54185 Å, Kappa  \\n4-circle goniometer, Photon 100 detector). Empirical absorption corrections using \\nequivalent reflections were performed with the program SADABS.\\n12\\n Structures were \\nsolved with SHELXD,\\n13\\n or by direct methods using SHELXS,\\n13\\n and refined by full-\\nCharacterisation Methods \\n \\n \\n50 \\n \\nmatrix least squares on F\\n2\\n by SHELXL,\\n13\\n interfaced through the programme \\nOLEX2.\\n14\\n In general, all non-H atoms were refined anisotropically. H atoms were \\nfixed in geometrically estimated positions using the riding model.  \\n2.2.2 Powder X-ray Diffraction (PXRD) \\nPXRD is a technique commonly employed in structure determination for assessing \\nthe phase-purity of solid state materials. A crystalline powder sample typically \\nconsists of a large number of crystallites, which are arranged in random orientations \\nto one another. When an X-ray beam is applied, diffraction occurs from the atomic \\nplanes in those crystallites which are at the correct angle to fulfil the Bragg \\ncondition. This gives rise to a diffraction pattern which is plotted as intensity against \\n2\\uf071.8 PXRD patterns were used herein to qualitatively assess the degree of \\ncrystallinity exhibited by bulk samples of the respective POC molecules, as well as \\nto confirm their phase purity in comparison to powder patterns simulated from \\nscXRD analysis and crystal-structure prediction (CSP) methods.   \\n \\nPXRD data for CC14 were collected on samples held between Scotch tape in \\ntransmission geometry on a Bruker D8 Advance diffractometer with  \\nGe-monochromated Cu Kα1 radiation and a LynxEye PSD. Spinning was enabled to \\nimprove particle statistics. Data were collected in the range 4° ≤ 2θ ≤ 50° with a step \\nsize of 0.01° over 4 hours. Le Bail fitting was carried out using TOPAS Academic.\\n15\\n \\n \\nPXRD data for CC16 were collected using a Panalytical X’Pert PRO HTS X-ray \\ndiffractometer with Cu Kα1 radiation. Samples were ground and mounted as a loose \\npowder onto transparent film, with data collected in the range 4° ≤ 2θ ≤ 50° with a \\nstep size of 0.013° over 1 hour.  \\n \\nFor CC19, as the cage was potentially sensitive to guest loss, crystals were ground \\nand dispersed in a minimal volume of crystallisation solvent before loading into \\nborosilicate glass capillaries. Laboratory PXRD data were collected from the samples \\nin transmission geometry on a Panalytical Empyrean diffractometer producing  \\nCu Kα1 radiation and equipped with an X-ray focussing mirror, using a PIXcel3D \\ndetector operating in 1-D scanning mode. Powder data were collected in the range  \\n2° ≤ 2\\uf071 ≤ 40° in steps of 0.013° over approximately 1 hour. This program was cycled \\nto monitor any structural changes over a period of 4 hours. In the absence of \\nCharacterisation Methods \\n \\n \\n51 \\n \\nsignificant changes in diffraction, individual patterns were summed to generate a \\ncumulative profile with improved counting statistics. The temperature of the \\ncapillary was controlled using an Oxford Cryosystems 700 Series Cryostream Plus. \\n \\n2.3 Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy \\nBy dissolving an organic molecule in a particular deuterated solvent and placing the \\nsample within a strong magnetic field, when irradiated with electromagnetic \\nradiation of a certain frequency, energy is absorbed to produce resonance.\\n16 \\nThe \\nNMR spectrum generated provides precise structural information on the molecule, \\nincluding the chemical environment of individual nuclei and the types and numbers \\nof equivalent nuclei present. \\n1\\nH and \\n13\\nC NMR spectroscopy were used to characterise \\nand confirm the purity of all POC molecules, precursors and intermediates \\nsynthesised herein.\\n \\nSolution \\n1\\nH and \\n13\\nC NMR spectra were recorded at 400.13 MHz and 100.6 MHz \\nrespectively using a Bruker Avance 400 NMR spectrometer. Chemical shifts are \\nreported in ppm (δ) with reference to the internal residual protonated species of the \\ndeuterated solvent used for \\n1\\nH and \\n13\\nC analysis. \\n \\n2.4 Fourier-Transform Infrared (FTIR) Spectroscopy \\nIn FTIR spectroscopy, infrared radiation is passed through a sample, with some of \\nthe radiation being absorbed. The resulting spectrum contains absorption peaks \\nwhich correspond to the characteristic vibrational frequencies of the chemical bonds \\nwhich constitute the sample, therefore enabling analysis of its chemical structure. \\nFTIR spectroscopy was used to characterise each of the POC molecules, as well as \\ntheir precursors and intermediates. \\nIR spectra were recorded using a Bruker Tensor 27 FT-IR spectrometer with Quest \\nATR (diamond crystal puck) attachment running Opus 6.5 software. Samples were \\nanalysed as dry powders for 16 scans with a resolution of 4 cm\\n-1\\n. Spectra were \\nrecorded in transmission mode. \\n2.5 Mass Spectrometry (MS) \\nMS involves the conversion of organic molecules into positively charged ions. The \\nions are sorted according to their mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) and their relative \\nCharacterisation Methods \\n \\n \\n52 \\n \\namounts are then determined.\\n16\\n Chemical ionisation (CI) and electrospray ionisation \\n(ESI) mass spectrometry were used to determine the accurate molecular weights of \\nthe POC precursors and their intermediates. Matrix-assisted laser \\ndesorption/ionisation time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) was used \\nto determine the accurate molecular weight, as well as the stoichiometry, of each \\nPOC molecule. \\nCI mass spectra were recorded using an Agilent Q-TOF 7201. ESI mass spectra were \\nrecorded using a Micromass LCT-MS. MALDI-TOF MS was conducted using an \\nAXIMA Confidence MALDI MS (Shimadzu Biotech) fitted with a 50 Hz  \\nN2 laser. A 10:1 ratio of matrix/sample was dissolved in tetrahydrofuran (THF,  \\n10 mg mL\\n-1\\n) and this was drop-coated onto the microtitre plate before analysis. For \\nCC14 and CC16, the matrix used was dithranol. For CC17 and CC18, the matrix \\nused was trans-2-[3-(4-tert-butylphenyl)-2-methyl-2-propenylidene]malononitrile \\n(DCTB).  \\n2.6 Elemental (CHN) Analysis \\nThrough the oxidation of an organic sample via combustion, CHN analysis enables \\nthe amounts of carbon, hydrogen and nitrogen present in the sample to be determined \\nand provide information on its composition and purity. CHN analysis was used to \\nconfirm the structure and purity of novel cage precursors and POC molecules. \\nCHN analysis was conducted using a Thermo FlashEA 1112 Elemental Analyser. \\nSamples were analysed as dry powders and the data was processed using dedicated \\nelemental analysis software.  \\n \\n2.7 High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) \\n \\nHPLC is a form of column chromatography that can be used to separate, identify and \\nquantify certain compounds. The constituents of a mixed sample can be separated \\nbased on differences between each compound’s interaction with both the solid \\nstationary and liquid mobile phases. This is represented by a difference in retention \\ntime, which is recorded by a suitable detector. In this thesis, both analytical and \\npreparative HPLC were performed in the reverse phase (RP), which involves the use \\nof a non-polar stationary phase and a polar mobile phase, whereby the compounds \\nare separated based on their size and hydrophobic interactions.\\n17\\n  \\nCharacterisation Methods \\n \\n \\n53 \\n \\n2.7.1 Analytical HPLC   \\nAnalytical HPLC was used to analyse both crude cage product mixtures and \\nsubsequently purified samples. Analysis was conducted using the Dionex Ultimate \\n3000 HPLC system. Analysis of mixed product samples of CC3 and CC14 was \\ncarried out using two Accucore RP-MS, 100 × 2.1 mm, 2.6 µm (SN 12163466BR6, \\nLot 11492) in series. The mobile phase was methanol at a flow rate of 0.5 mL min\\n-1\\n. \\nThe injection volume was 1 µL and the sample concentration was ca. 1 mg mL\\n-1\\n in \\nchloroform. The column oven temperature was set to 30 °C. Detection for HPLC \\nanalysis was conducted at 254 nm. The column used for the analysis of pure samples \\nof CC14 was Syncronis C8, 150 × 4.6 mm, 3 µm (SN 10136940, Lot 12459). The \\nmobile phase was methanol at a flow rate of 0.5 mL min\\n-1\\n. The injection volume was \\n5 µL and the sample concentration was ca. 1 mg mL\\n-1\\n in chloroform. The column \\noven temperature was set to 30 °C. Detection for HPLC analysis was conducted at \\n254 nm. The column used for the analysis of both crude and purified product samples \\nof CC17 was Syncronis C8, 150 × 4.6 mm, 3 µm (SN 10136940, Lot 12459). The \\nmobile phase was methanol-water (10:90 to 90:10 over 27 minutes) at a flow rate of  \\n0.5 mL min\\n-1\\n. The injection volume was 2 µL and the sample concentration was  \\nca. 1 mg mL\\n-1\\n in DMSO. The column oven temperature was set to 30 °C. Detection \\nfor HPLC analysis was conducted at 254 nm. \\n2.7.2 Preparative HPLC \\nPreparative HPLC was utilised to isolate pure samples of CC14 and CC17. It was \\nconducted using the Shimadzu Prominence Preparative HPLC system. The column \\nused for the purification of mixed product samples of CC3 and CC14 was Syncronis \\nC8, 150 × 30 mm, 5 µm (SN 10159851, Lot 12105). The mobile phase was methanol \\nat a flow rate of 35 mL min\\n-1\\n. The injection volume was 400 µL and the sample \\nconcentration was ca. 20 mg mL\\n-1\\n in chloroform. The column oven temperature was \\nset to 30 °C. Detection for HPLC analysis was conducted at 254 nm. The column \\nused for the purification of crude product samples of CC17 was Syncronis C8,  \\n150 × 30 mm, 5 µm (SN 10159851, Lot 12105). The mobile phase was methanol-\\nwater (10:90 to 90:10 over 9 minutes) at a flow rate of 35 mL min\\n-1\\n. The injection \\nvolume was 600 µL and the sample concentration was ca. 20 mg mL\\n-1\\n in  \\nCharacterisation Methods \\n \\n \\n54 \\n \\nDMSO-methanol (2:1). The column oven temperature was set to 30 °C. Detection for \\nHPLC analysis was conducted at 254 nm. \\n2.8 Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM)  \\nIn SEM, an electron beam is scanned across a selected area of a solid sample’s \\nsurface. The electrons penetrate the sample, with the interaction generating \\ninformation, typically represented as a high-magnification image, concerning the \\ntopography of the sample, as well as enabling analysis of its crystalline structure and \\nchemical composition.\\n18\\n SEM was used to characterise the morphologies of \\ncrystalline samples of CC14 and CC16. \\nHigh resolution imaging of the crystal morphology was achieved using a Hitachi  \\nS-4800 Cold Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope (FE-SEM). Scanning-\\nmode samples were prepared by depositing dry crystals on 15 mm Hitachi M4 \\naluminium stubs using an adhesive high-purity carbon tab before coating with a 2 nm \\nlayer of gold using an Emitech K550X automated sputter coater. Imaging was \\nconducted at a working distance of 8 mm and a working voltage of 3 kV using a mix \\nof upper and lower secondary electron detectors. The FE-SEM measurement scale \\nbar was calibrated using certified SIRA calibration standards. \\n2.9 Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA) \\nTGA allows changes in the physical and chemical properties of materials to be \\nmeasured as a function of increasing temperature (with constant heating rate) or as a \\nfunction of time (with constant temperature). TGA was used to determine the change \\nin water content of CC17 upon exposure to air.  \\nTGA was carried out using a Q5000IR analyser (TA instruments) with an automated \\nvertical overhead thermobalance. The sample was heated under nitrogen at a rate  \\nof 5 °C min\\n-1\\n up to 120 °C and the temperature was held isothermally for  \\n1 hour. The sample was then cooled under either air or nitrogen down to 30 °C at a \\nrate of 10 °C min\\n-1\\n. The procedure was then repeated as appropriate.  \\n \\n \\nCharacterisation Methods \\n \\n \\n55 \\n \\n2.10 References  \\n1. G. Attard and C.

In the solid state, it retains shape-\\npersistency upon desolvation, with its α-phase packing in a window-to-window \\narrangement to generate a 3-D diamondoid pore network which passes through the \\nintrinsic cage voids (Figure 3.1b).  \\n \\nFigure 3.1 (a) Reaction scheme for the synthesis of CC3.\\n3\\n (b) Representation of the \\nsingle crystal structure and packing arrangement of CC3α, with a 3-D diamondoid \\npore network passing through the intrinsic cage voids (yellow – right).2 \\nThe inherent porosity leads to a high level of microporosity after desolvation, with an \\napparent BET surface area of 409 m\\n2\\n g\\n-1\\n in its most crystalline form.\\n4\\n The \\ninterconnected micropore structure of CC3α has recently been exploited for the \\nseparation of organic molecules based on solid state “shape-sorting”5 and the \\nselective separation of noble gases.\\n6\\n As with other POC molecules, CC3 is solution \\nprocessable and this characteristic has enabled it to be cast into composite \\nmembranes\\n7\\n and macroporous supports\\n8\\n or combined in a modular way to create \\nSynthesis of an Asymmetric Porous Organic Cage \\n \\n \\n58 \\n \\nporous co-crystals.\\n9\\n In addition, CC3 has been shown to be very stable, retaining its \\ncrystal packing arrangement, and without significant decomposition, even after being \\nboiled in water for prolonged periods of time.\\n10\\n \\nCC3 has also been well-studied computationally through MD simulations, especially \\nwith regards to investigating the ability of small gas molecules to diffuse through the \\npore structure.\\n11\\n If each cage molecule is considered to be static, then the narrowest \\npoint in the 3-D pore structure, a circumcircle denoted as the pore-limiting diameter \\n(PLD) and located between the cage and window cavities, has a value of 3.62 Å. \\nAccording to Holden et al., considering the kinetic diameter of N2 is 3.64 Å, it could \\nbe argued that the pore channel needs to be wider than this in order to facilitate \\ndiffusion, in which case CC3 should be formally non-porous to N2.\\n12\\n However, gas \\nsorption measurements have confirmed the ability of CC3 to adsorb significant \\nquantities of N2 (4.50 mmol g\\n-1\\n) at 77 K and 1 bar.\\n4\\n Alternatively, by allowing for the \\nvibrational motion of the cage molecules, it was found that the flexibility of the host \\nsystem resulted in a time-averaged, pore-limiting envelope (PLE), where the \\ndistribution of window sizes for the empty host ranged from 3.0 Å to 4.5 Å.\\n12\\n Using \\nthis model, the narrowest point in the 3-D pore structure was, for a calculable \\npercentage of the simulated time period, wide enough to facilitate the diffusion of \\ngas molecules such as N2. In addition, larger gas molecules, such as Xe, which \\naccording to the static models should be much too big to pass through the cage \\nwindows, are able to diffuse between cage molecules via opportunistic hopping.  \\nThe synthesis of new POCs with precise control over pore size and topology is \\ntherefore of major interest, as it provides the opportunity to tailor the properties of \\nthese porous materials towards a specific application. Based on the relative success \\nof CC3, synthesising derivatives of it in an isoreticular manner should impart new \\nproperties through tuning the dimensions of the 3-D diamondoid pore network. \\n3.2 Synthesis of a Methylated CC3 Derivative  \\nThe term isoreticular is defined as ‘based on the same net (having the same \\ntopology)’.13 The concept of isoreticular porous materials was pioneered by \\nEddaoudi et al., where an isoreticular series of MOFs, each possessing a molecular \\nstrut of varying length or functionality, was synthesised.\\n14\\n Variance of these struts \\nled to porous materials ranging in pore size, gas uptake capability and density, whilst \\nSynthesis of an Asymmetric Porous Organic Cage \\n \\n \\n59 \\n \\npreserving the same packing motif. Since then, many MOFs and COFs have been \\nsynthesised following these principles.\\n15-19\\n However, to date, an isoreticular series of \\nPOCs has not been successfully designed and synthesised, although certain POCs \\ncan be induced to display identical packing modes through the use of a directing \\nsolvent.\\n20\\n As POC molecules are discrete and interact together through a range of \\ndifferent supramolecular interactions, it is difficult to predict how they will pack in \\nthe solid state. In addition, small changes to the cage building blocks often preclude \\nthe formation of the cage, change the stoichiometry of the building blocks within the \\ncage (for example, favouring ‘[8+12]’ over ‘[4+6]’ cages),21 or change the way in \\nwhich the cage molecules pack together in the solid state.  \\nAnother challenge in the area of POCs is the introduction of functionality that can be \\nused to either tune properties or enable the material to be used for a secondary \\npurpose. Amongst the best examples of the latter have stemmed from the Zhang \\ngroup, where discrete molecular cages have been linked together via Sonogashira \\ncoupling to form OCFs\\n22\\n or functionalised with interior thioether groups for \\ncontrolling the synthesis of gold nanoparticles.\\n23\\n  \\nOur initial aim was to tune the porous properties of CC3 by synthesising derivatives \\nof its trialdehyde precursor TFB. The introduction of methyl groups into the TFB \\nprecursor offered the opportunity to narrow the dimensions of the pore windows, in \\nconjunction with the cage molecules packing in an isoreticular manner to its parent \\ncage CC3. This would also allow a direct comparison between the porous properties \\nof the two cages and hence a greater understanding of their behaviour. The \\nmotivation for this was directed towards the separation of gas molecules of varying \\nsize. This is of relevance to the separation of noble gases, whereby the diffusion of \\nlarger gas molecules, such as Xe, through the pore network might be restricted, \\nhence providing a greater degree of separation via a gating effect.\\n24\\n  \\nThe use of methyl and other alkyl groups to tailor microporosity has been previously \\nreported for porous networks. Tilford et al. synthesised a series of alkyl substituted \\nCOFs using dialkyl substituted derivatives of 1,2,4,5-tetrahydroxybenzene as a \\nprecursor.\\n25\\n Altering the alkyl group from methyl to propyl resulted in a reduction in \\npore size from 18 Å to 11 Å respectively. This was also reflected in a significant \\ndrop in surface area. Although the N2 uptake decreased, the H2 uptake  \\nSynthesis of an Asymmetric Porous Organic Cage \\n \\n \\n60 \\n \\n(mol H2/mol COF) actually increased upon introducing longer alkyl chains. This was \\nrationalised by the ability of the smaller H2 molecules to access pore corner cavities \\nand adsorb onto the alkyl chains. In a similar vein, Ghanem et al. synthesised \\nnetwork-PIMs derived from triptycene monomers possessing different alkyl groups \\nattached to their bridgehead positions.\\n26\\n The gas sorption properties could be tuned \\nby varying the length and branching of the alkyl chain: methyl and isopropyl chains \\nafforded materials with the highest surface area, while longer alkyl chains were \\nfound to significantly reduce the microporosity. Alternatively, Liu et al. studied the \\neffect of methyl functionalisation on the capacity and binding energy for CO2 \\nadsorption in MOFs.\\n27\\n The introduction of the methyl groups resulted in a loss of \\nsurface area and pore volume. However, an enhanced CO2 capacity was observed, \\nand this was attributed to the methyl groups inducing stronger interactions between \\nthe framework and CO2 molecules. This behaviour was confirmed by an increase in \\nthe isosteric heat of CO2 adsorption. Other examples of MOFs have shown similar \\nproperties, where the loss of surface area has been compensated for by an increase in \\nCO2 uptake.\\n28, 29\\n Finally, Schneider et al. reported a series of POCs whose intrinsic \\nvoids had been post-synthetically modified through Williamson etherification.\\n30\\n The \\nintroduction of alkyl chains of varying size allowed the pore structures of the POCs \\nto be “fine-tuned”, with the bulkier substituents filling up more of the interior and \\ncorresponding to lower surface areas.  \\nThe methylated derivative of TFB, 1,3,5-trimethyl-2,4,6-tris(formyl)benzene \\n(Me3TFB), was chosen as a candidate for inclusion into a CC3 analogue.  \\nMe3TFB (1) was synthesised in a 69 % yield from 1,3,5-trimethyl-2,4,6-\\ntris(bromomethyl)benzene via a modified Hass procedure (Scheme 3.1).\\n31, 32\\n Despite \\nscreening various conditions, the reaction of Me3TFB with R,R-CHDA resulted in no \\ncage species being detected. Only insoluble oligomeric by-products and unconsumed \\nstarting material were observed. This was rationalised on the basis of the steric \\nhindrance of the methyl groups inhibiting the formation of a closed cage structure. \\nSynthesis of an Asymmetric Porous Organic Cage \\n \\n \\n61 \\n \\n \\nScheme 3.1 Proposed reaction scheme for the synthesis of a methylated CC3 \\nderivative.

Our rationale was that introducing TFB would reduce the steric \\ncrowding and allow the formation of a mixed TFB/Me3TFB cage product. This \\nprocedure was based on the method outlined by Jiang et al., whereby TFB was \\nreacted with two different diamines to give an equilibrium distribution of POC \\nproducts with mixed vertex functionalities.\\n33\\n Of course, here the ratio of the \\ntrialdehydes was being altered instead of the diamines.  \\nTable 3.1 Synthesis of cage mixtures by the reaction of R,R-CHDA with various \\nratios of TFB and Me3TFB. \\nTFB: \\nMe3TFB \\nTFB Me3TFB Yield / \\nmg \\nAppearance \\n \\n4:0 \\n \\n100 mg, 0.62 mmol \\n \\n0 mg, 0 mmol \\n \\n118 \\n \\nPowdery white \\nsolid \\n \\n3:1 75 mg, 0.46 mmol 32 mg, 0.16 mmol 87 \\n2:2 50 mg, 0.31 mmol 63 mg, 0.31 mmol 61 Flaky yellow \\nsolid \\n \\n1:3 25 mg, 0.15 mmol 94 mg, 0.46 mmol 93 \\n    \\nAs outlined in Table 3.1, with an increasing amount of Me3TFB, the appearance of \\nthe isolated product changed from a powdery white solid to a flaky yellow solid \\nwhich displayed limited solubility.

This contrasts with the scrambling of the diamines, where all seven \\nhypothetical cage species were obtained.\\n33\\n Since there is only one other peak at  \\n2.36 min, and as the peak intensity for CC3 decreases as the amount of Me3TFB \\nused increases, the additional cage species was theorised to be a cage containing \\nthree equivalents of TFB and one equivalent of Me3TFB, denoted here as CC14. \\nThis indicates that only one Me3TFB may be accommodated in a cage molecule; this \\nis likely due to steric hindrance. It should be noted that the peak intensities have been \\nnormalised to better represent the relative amounts of each cage that has formed. \\nThis is because at higher Me3TFB ratios, the amount of oligomeric and polymeric \\nmaterial in the isolated product increases, as cage formation is now more restricted. \\nThe peak intensities of both cage molecules in the HPLC trace are therefore much \\nlower.  \\nSynthesis of an Asymmetric Porous Organic Cage \\n \\n \\n63 \\n \\n3.3 Isolation and Characterisation of the Asymmetric Cage CC14 \\n \\nScheme 3.2 Reaction scheme for the synthesis of the cage product mixture of CC3 \\nand CC14.  \\nAs a result of the initial screen, a ratio of TFB-Me3TFB (3:1) was used to synthesise \\nthe mixed cage product sample on a larger scale.

However, a weak molecular ion peak of  \\nm/z = 1201 is also observable, and this may be assigned to a cage species containing \\ntwo equivalents each of TFB and Me3TFB. This cage species was not detected upon  \\n1\\nH NMR analysis but may explain a slight shoulder on the CC14 peak in the post-\\npurification HPLC analysis (Figure 3.3). As MALDI-TOF is not quantitative, it is \\npresumed that the impurity is in fact very small and it therefore has little or no effect \\non crystallinity or gas sorption behaviour.  \\nSynthesis of an Asymmetric Porous Organic Cage \\n \\n \\n65 \\n \\n \\nFigure 3.5 MALDI-TOF mass spectrum of CC14 in dithranol/THF solution.

Crystallisation of the cage from DCM-acetone (vial-in-vial) gave octahedral \\ncrystals that were characterised by scXRD (performed by Dr Marc Little;  \\nFigure 3.6). CC14 crystallised in the chiral cubic space group F4132, reminiscent of \\nCC3α,36 where the cage molecule has tetrahedral symmetry (point group T) and \\npacks in a window-to-window fashion, with a 3-D diamondoid pore network passing \\nthrough the intrinsic cage voids. The methylated aromatic group was disordered over \\nthe four possible aromatic sites in each cage and no ordering of the methyl groups \\nbetween cages was observed. As predicted, the methyl groups protrude into the \\ndiamondoid pore network. Therefore, with the retention of the pore network, it can \\nbe argued that CC14 is isoreticular with respect to its parent cage CC3. Furthermore, \\nwith the methyl groups protruding into the cage windows, this should offer modified \\ngas sorption properties.  \\nSynthesis of an Asymmetric Porous Organic Cage \\n \\n \\n66 \\n \\n \\nFigure 3.6 Displacement ellipsoid plot from the single crystal structure \\nCC14∙(CH2Cl2)0.5.

However, the overall N2 uptake and apparent BET surface area of CC14 \\n(4.11 mmol g\\n-1\\n, 320 m\\n2\\n g\\n-1\\n) are slightly lower than that of CC3 (4.50 mmol g\\n-1\\n,  \\nSynthesis of an Asymmetric Porous Organic Cage \\n \\n \\n68 \\n \\n409 m\\n2\\n g\\n-1\\n) at 77 K and 1 bar. This decrease in N2 capacity was expected, as the \\nintroduction of the methyl groups has reduced the pore volume and subsequently \\nincreased the mass of the cage. This correlates with the observations of Tilford et al. \\nfor example, where the inclusion of longer chain alkyl groups in a range of COFs \\nresulted in a decrease in surface area.\\n25\\n  \\n \\nFigure 3.9 N2 sorption isotherms for crystalline (CC3α and CC14\\na\\n) and amorphous \\n(CC14\\nb\\n) samples at 77 K and 1 bar. Filled and open symbols represent adsorption \\nand desorption isotherms respectively.  \\nThe gas sorption properties of crystalline CC14 with respect to other gases (H2, CO2, \\nXe and Kr) also follow this downward trend in comparison to CC3 (Table 3.2). On \\nthe other hand, the gas sorption properties for the amorphous sample of CC14 \\nsurpass those of crystalline CC3. This behaviour could be rationalised, as it has been \\nreported that amorphous samples of CC3, generated by rapidly-induced \\nprecipitation, exhibit enhanced microporosity due to an increase in both disorder and \\ndefects.\\n4\\n CC14 shows no evidence of an enhanced capacity for a particular gas, \\nwhich differs from the methylated MOFs and COFs that were introduced in  \\nSection 3.2. \\nThe respective PSDs of CC14 and CC3, measured using CO2 as a probe gas  \\n(Figure 3.10a), not only demonstrates the reduction in pore volume upon the \\nSynthesis of an Asymmetric Porous Organic Cage \\n \\n \\n69 \\n \\nintroduction of the methyl groups, but also a contraction of the pore width to a \\nnarrower size. This phenomenon was also studied by MD simulations, whereby \\nchanges to the PLE and cage cavity size, in comparison to CC3, were investigated. \\nAs previously discussed, cage molecules are not static bodies due to their inherent \\nflexibility and are continuously vibrating; resulting in changes to the size of the pore \\nwindow.\\n12\\n Therefore, gases that may be considered too large to fit, such as Xe, are \\nable to diffuse through, as the pore windows are “open” for a certain amount of the \\nsimulated time period. For example, in CC3, it was found that the distribution of \\nwindow sizes varies from 3.0 Å to 4.5 Å for the empty host, and that the cage \\nwindow is “open” to Xe for only 7 % of the simulation time.11 The restricted \\ndiffusion characteristics of Xe in CC3 have also been confirmed by dynamic \\nbreakthrough measurements, where the larger Xe atom was separated from Kr at low \\nconcentrations in air.\\n6\\n \\n \\nFigure 3.10 (a) PSD for CC14 (filled red circles) and CC3 (filled black squares) \\nusing CO2 as a probe gas.

(d) Plot showing the cage \\ncavity size for CC14 and CC3 over five structural models. \\nSynthesis of an Asymmetric Porous Organic Cage \\n \\n \\n70 \\n \\nThe introduction of methyl groups into the interconnected pore structure of CC3 \\nwould be expected to shift the cage cavity size and PLE to a narrower distribution  \\n(to the left), as was found upon investigation of the PSD. For CC14, as the position \\nof the methylated aromatic group is disordered with respect to adjacent cage \\nmolecules, MD simulations (performed by Dr Dan Holden) were run for five \\nstructural models, with the placement of the methylated aromatic group randomised \\nto ensure that a suitable statistical representation of different packing motifs was \\nsampled. Analysis of the CC14 pore structure showed that the cavity size for all five \\nmodels remains consistent, even though the position of the methylated aromatic \\ngroup was randomised over the structure (Figure 3.10d). This resulted in a slightly \\nreduced average diameter (4.80 Å) in comparison to CC3. In theory, this means that \\nit would be more difficult for larger gas molecules such as Xe to enter the cage cavity \\nvia opportunistic hopping.  \\nSimilarly, the PLE was also observed to shift to the left, and the distribution of this is \\ndetermined by the position of the methylated aromatic face (Figure 3.10c). When \\ncompared to CC3, it can be seen that the average size of the channel between the \\npore windows has been reduced from ~3.60 Å to ~2.75 Å, and that there is a broader \\ndistribution of channel sizes. This will have a direct impact on the kinetics of the 3-D \\npore structure, as the bottleneck feature of it is more pronounced; therefore making \\ngas diffusion more difficult, and as a consequence, relatively slower. Furthermore, \\nwith more methylated aromatic faces in close proximity, which is statistically \\npossible, the site will become even smaller and therefore amplify this effect. \\nCC14 shows a similar ideal selectivity to CC3 for Xe over Kr, which we previously \\nshowed could be used to perform industrially relevant separations.\\n6\\n Xe adsorption \\nkinetics measurements (performed by Dr Tom Hasell) reveal the difference created \\nby the narrowing of the pore channels in CC14, with the diffusion of Xe through the \\nstructure being visibly hindered (Figure 3.10b). This also complements the findings \\nof the MD simulations. Controlling the diffusion of Xe through the cage crystals in \\nthis way could give practical advantages in terms of breakthrough separations, with \\nrelevance to the treatment of radioactive air streams.\\n37, 38\\n \\n \\n \\nSynthesis of an Asymmetric Porous Organic Cage \\n \\n \\n71 \\n \\n3.5 Synthesis of Other TFB Derivatives \\nTo investigate the effect of sterics on this scrambling strategy, two more TFB \\nderivatives were synthesised, with each possessing more sterically demanding \\nsubstituents.  \\n \\nScheme 3.3 Reaction scheme for the synthesis of 1,3,5-triethyl-2,4,6-\\ntris(formyl)benzene (Et3TFB), 2. Reaction conditions: (i) NaH, 2-nitropropane, \\nDMF, rt, 74 %. \\nEt3TFB (2) was also synthesised via a modified Hass procedure (Scheme 3.3) using \\nsodium hydride as a base instead of sodium methoxide, which gave unsatisfactory \\nyields in this case.\\n31\\n Following the procedure utilised for the scrambling of Me3TFB, \\nthe reaction of TFB and Et3TFB with R,R-CHDA only yielded CC3 upon analysis by \\nanalytical HPLC. This shows that the longer ethyl chains take up too much space and \\nimpede the incorporation of even a single Et3TFB molecule into the cage structure. \\nThis indicated that methyl groups may be as big a functionality that can be \\nintroduced onto TFB without precluding cage formation. \\n \\nScheme 3.4 Reaction scheme for the synthesis of 1,3,5-tribromo-2,4,6-\\ntris(formyl)benzene (Br3TFB), 7.

(v) PCC, Celite, 4 Å MS, DCM, rt, 92 %.  \\nSynthesis of an Asymmetric Porous Organic Cage \\n \\n \\n72 \\n \\nTo investigate this effect further, Br3TFB (7) was synthesised following a five-step \\nprocedure previously reported by Bruns et al (Scheme 3.4).\\n39\\n Starting from \\ntrimethylbenzene, successive bromination reactions of the aromatic and methyl \\nprotons yielded 4. The nucleophilic substitution reaction of the bromomethyl \\nsubstituents with potassium acetate gave 5, and subsequent base hydrolysis to the  \\ntri-alcohol 6, followed by oxidation using pyridinium chlorochromate (PCC), gave \\nthe desired trialdehyde 7. All steps were in good to excellent yields with the final \\nproduct obtained in high purity. \\nHowever, when Br3TFB was scrambled with TFB and R,R-CHDA, analysis by \\nanalytical HPLC again showed the formation of no asymmetric cage species, with \\nonly CC3 observable. As previously hypothesised, this may be due to the steric bulk, \\nthis time of the large bromine atom, inhibiting cage formation. \\n3.6 Conclusions and Outlook  \\nA derivative of the POC precursor TFB, possessing three additional methyl groups, \\nwas chosen as a candidate for cage synthesis. Its incorporation was hypothesised to \\nnarrow the dimensions of the pore windows in the resultant cage molecule, therefore \\ntuning the gas sorption properties while retaining the same topology as the parent \\ncage CC3.  \\nAlthough cage formation was unsuccessful, it was found that by scrambling this \\nderivative (Me3TFB) with TFB and R,R-CHDA and then subsequently purifying by \\npreparative HPLC, the POC molecule CC14 could be isolated as a phase-pure porous \\nmaterial. Packing in an isoreticular window-to-window fashion, CC14 possesses the \\nsame 3-D diamondoid pore network as CC3α, with the methyl groups protruding \\ninto the cage cavity. In comparison to CC3, gas sorption analysis showed that \\ncrystalline CC14 exhibited a marked decrease in gas uptake across a range of gases, \\nwhich verifies the loss of pore volume upon the introduction of the methyl groups. \\nThis characteristic was also confirmed by MD simulations, where the cage cavity \\nsize and PLE of CC14 were shown to constrict in comparison to CC3. Investigation \\nof the Xe kinetics showed that the diffusion of this large noble gas through the pore \\nstructure of CC14 was more hindered, and whilst complementing the findings of the \\nMD simulations, it also showed that CC14 could find potential application in the \\nseparation of Xe from Kr gas.  \\nSynthesis of an Asymmetric Porous Organic Cage \\n \\n \\n73 \\n \\nThe unsuccessful incorporation of other TFB derivatives shows that this approach \\ntowards synthesising a series of isoreticular cages may be of limited scope. However, \\nthis was shown to be a steric issue, so if it was possible to introduce smaller groups  \\n- such as fluorine for example - then the preparation of a family of cages with tunable \\nproperties can be envisaged. Furthermore, the trialdehyde precursor need not contain \\nthree additional groups on the aromatic ring. The introduction of a single functional \\ngroup should suffice, with the aim of tuning properties being retained. TFB \\nderivatives of this type have already been successfully utilised in POC synthesis \\nwithin our research group. Finally, derivatives of other trialdehyde precursors used in \\nthe synthesis of POCs, such as 1,3,5-tri(4-formylphenyl)benzene,\\n40\\n could also be \\nsynthesised and utilised with the same aims in mind.  \\n3.7 Experimental \\n3.7.1 Materials \\nSodium hydride (57 – 63 % dispersion in mineral oil) was purchased from Alfa \\nAesar.

Single crystals of \\nCC14 were very weakly diffracting, even though the data was collected using a \\nsynchrotron radiation source. The asymmetric unit for CC14∙(CH2Cl2)0.5 comprises \\n1/12 of a cage fragment and part of a partially occupied CH2Cl2 solvent molecule.  \\nA resolution limit of 0.9 Å was applied during refinement. Due to poor data quality, \\nlarge wR2 values were obtained after refinement of the structural model. The \\naromatic ring and directly bonded carbon atoms were refined with a planetary \\nrestraint (FLAT in SHELX). One carbon-carbon bond of the cyclohexyl ring was \\nrefined with a bond length restraint (DFIX in SHELX). For the cage molecule, \\natomic displacement parameters were restrained during refinement (SIMU and \\nDELU in SHELX). The methyl substituted aromatic ring was disordered over the \\nfour aromatic ring positions for each cage molecule. Due to the symmetry of the \\nspace group, no respective ordering of the methyl groups could be determined. One \\npartially occupied CH2Cl2 solvent molecule, site occupancy 50 %, was located in the \\nintrinsic cage cavity.  \\n3.9 References \\n1. P. Skowronek and J. Gawronski, Org.

An alternative approach was to instead prepare and utilise new vicinal \\ndiamine precursors. The vast majority of commercially available diamines have \\nalready been evaluated within our research group. Therefore, in order to access new \\nPOCs, new diamines would need to be synthesised.  \\nThe preparation and utilisation of vicinal diamines in POC synthesis has been \\nexplored rarely, with more attention being paid to the synthesis of the aldehyde \\ncomponent for imine bond-based cages.\\n1-3\\n A notable exception is that of Giri et al., \\nwho in the pursuit of porous liquid candidates, designed and prepared a range of \\naliphatic diamines towards the synthesis of alkylated organic cages.\\n4\\n  \\nThe preparation of enantiomerically-pure derivatives of the CC3 precursor CHDA \\nwas of particular interest, as this has been successfully used in the synthesis of other \\nPOCs.\\n3\\n Ideally, the candidate 1,2-diamine would be functionalised at the 4,5-\\npositions, with the expectation that this would frustrate the molecular packing and \\ngenerate additional extrinsic porosity to complement the intrinsic cage cavity. This \\nwould also allow a direct comparison with the gas sorption properties of CC3. \\nFurthermore, the introduction of reactive functional groups that would allow tuning \\nof the gas sorption properties or enable the material to be used for a secondary \\npurpose has been explored rarely with respect to POCs.\\n5-7\\n Post-synthetic \\nmodification (PSM) of the cage periphery would be particularly significant, as it \\noffers the potential to tune the properties and subsequent application of the resultant \\nPOC. This strategy has already been well documented for MOFs\\n8\\n and other porous \\nnetworks and polymers.\\n9-11\\n \\n4.2 Synthesis and Characterisation of Porous Organic Cage CC16 \\n(1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2-Diamino-4,5-dimethylcyclohexane was identified as a suitable \\nprecursor for POC synthesis. The two methyl groups at the 4,5-positions would be \\nexpected to increase the space between the cage molecules and therefore create \\nadditional accessible surface area. The creation of additional extrinsic porosity has \\nbeen previously explored by Bojdys et al., who used bulky directing groups to \\nSynthesis of Periphery-Substituted Porous Organic Cages \\n \\n82 \\n \\nfrustrate the crystal packing, resulting in an improvement in surface area in \\ncomparison to unfunctionalised cages of the same dimensions.\\n12\\n \\nFollowing literature procedures, the diamine precursor 4 was isolated as a \\ndihydrochloride salt (Scheme 4.1). Bis-imine 1 was synthesised in quantitative yield \\nfrom (S)-1-phenylethylamine via reaction with glyoxal trimer dihydrate. The addition \\nof allylzinc bromide at -78 °C afforded the N,N'-disubstituted 4,5-diamino-1,7-\\noctadiene 2 in a 70 % yield with the 4R,5R configuration isolated as the major \\ndiastereoisomer.\\n13\\n Treatment of 2 with n-butylmagnesium chloride and catalytic bis-\\n(cyclopentadienyl)zirconium (IV) dichloride resulted in reductive cyclisation to the \\ncyclohexane derivative.\\n14\\n Despite purification by flash column chromatography, \\nimpurities were still observable upon isolation. Subsequent precipitation of the \\ndiamine hydrochloride salt from a DCM solution gave the pure product 3. \\nHydrogenolysis of 3 was conducted using 20 % palladium hydroxide on carbon at  \\n8 atmospheres pressure of hydrogen for 48 h, yielding the desired diamine salt 4.    \\n \\nScheme 4.1 Reaction scheme for the synthesis of CC16. Reaction conditions:  \\n(i) Glyoxal trimer dihydrate, MgSO4, DCM, rt, 100 %. (ii) AllylZnBr, THF, -78 °C, \\n70 %. (iii) n-ButylMgCl, Cp2ZrCl2, Et2O then 4 M HCl, DCM, rt, 64 % (2 steps).  \\n(iv) Pd(OH)2/C, H2, CH3OH, rt, 99 %. (v) Et3N then TFB, DCM-CH3OH, rt, 79 %. \\nDiamine salts have been previously used to synthesise POCs.\\n15\\n The standard \\nprocedure involves free-basing the diamine salt using two equivalents of \\ntriethylamine in a methanol solution, followed by slow addition to a solution of TFB \\nin DCM. Following this outline, the biphasic reaction of 4 and TFB was left to stand \\nat room temperature for five days. After this time, no precipitated material was \\nSynthesis of Periphery-Substituted Porous Organic Cages \\n \\n83 \\n \\nobservable, which is atypical of a cage synthesis under these conditions.\\n15\\n However, \\nanalysis by \\n1\\nH NMR spectroscopy showed that the trialdehyde had been fully \\nconsumed, with sharp singlet peaks with an integration ratio of 1:1 in the imine and \\naromatic regions confirming the formation of a single cage product. Slowly \\nremoving the DCM solvent under vacuum induced precipitation of a white solid and \\nthe desired cage CC16 was isolated upon vacuum filtration in a 79 % yield.  \\nAnalysis by \\n1\\nH NMR spectroscopy mirrored the observations made for the crude \\nreaction mixture, with singlet peaks at δ 8.16 ppm and δ 7.89 ppm confirming the \\npresence of imine and aromatic protons respectively in a 1:1 ratio. Upon integrating \\nthe imine and aromatic signals to twelve protons each, the doublet at δ 1.19 ppm, \\nrepresenting the methyl groups located at the 4,5-positions of the cyclohexane ring, \\nintegrated to the required thirty-six protons (Figure 4.1).  \\n \\nFigure 4.1 \\n1\\nH NMR spectrum (CDCl3) of CC16.  \\nAnalysis by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry gave a molecular ion peak of  \\nm/z = 1286, which correlates to a [4+6] cage structure (Figure 4.2). No other cage \\nspecies were observable upon inspection of the spectrum, confirming that a single \\nproduct had been isolated. \\nSynthesis of Periphery-Substituted Porous Organic Cages \\n \\n84 \\n \\n \\nFigure 4.2 MALDI-TOF mass spectrum of CC16 in dithranol/THF solution.  \\nThe bulk cage material isolated from the original reaction mixture, once fully \\ndesolvated, was found to be crystalline upon analysis by PXRD, with the powder \\npattern closely matching that simulated from scXRD analysis (Figure 4.3).   \\n \\nFigure 4.3 PXRD data for as-synthesised desolvated CC16 (blue) and that simulated \\nfrom single crystal analysis (red). \\nSynthesis of Periphery-Substituted Porous Organic Cages \\n \\n85 \\n \\nCrystallisation of the cage from DCM-ethyl acetate (vial-in-vial) gave very small \\noctahedral crystals which could be characterised by scXRD (performed by Dr Marc \\nLittle; Figure 4.4a). CC16 crystallised in the chiral cubic space group F4132, in \\nwhich the cage molecules have tetrahedral symmetry (point group T) and pack in a \\nwindow-to-window fashion, with a 3-D diamondoid pore network passing through \\nthe intrinsic cage voids (Figure 4.4b). The packing is reminiscent of that observed for \\nthe parent cage CC3 in its α-phase.16 The peripheral methyl groups act as a wedge, \\nforcing apart the cages and resulting in additional extrinsic porosity being generated, \\nas well as the formation of an additional pore channel. The observed pore structure is \\nsimilar to another cage, CC13, where its β-polymorph exhibits a double, \\ninterpenetrating pore structure upon exposure to a 1,4-dioxane directing solvent.\\n17\\n \\nAdvantageously, CC16 does not require an additional directing solvent to achieve \\nthis. However, whereas the positionally-disordered geminal dimethyl groups in \\nCC13 significantly improve the cage’s solubility properties, the solubility of CC16, \\neven in chlorinated solvents, is poor.  \\n \\nFigure 4.4 (a) Displacement ellipsoid plot from the single crystal structure  \\nCC16∙(CH2Cl2)3.

The \\nimprovement in surface area and overall N2 and H2 uptakes is a direct consequence \\nSynthesis of Periphery-Substituted Porous Organic Cages \\n \\n87 \\n \\nof the peripheral methyl groups generating extra accessible space between the \\nindividual cage molecules (Figure 4.6a). This matches the observations made upon \\nscXRD analysis, where larger pores, as well as additional pore channels, were \\nobservable between the individual cage molecules as a result of the peripheral methyl \\ngroups frustrating the packing in the solid state. This conclusion is confirmed by \\nanalysis of the PSD (Figure 4.6b), which demonstrates a broader range of micropore \\nsizes in comparison to CC3. In contrast, the CO2 uptake for CC16 is very similar to \\nCC3, and this can be rationalised based on the fact that this measurement was run at \\n273 K, where the effect of a larger pore size on total gas uptake would be reduced. \\n \\nFigure 4.6 (a) Gas sorption isotherms for N2 (blue triangles) and H2 (black squares) \\nat 77 K and 1 bar for CC16.

(b) PSD for CC16 using N2 as a probe gas.  \\nSynthesis of Periphery-Substituted Porous Organic Cages \\n \\n88 \\n \\nSchneider et al. previously investigated the influence of peripheral groups on the \\nporosity of POCs by incorporating salicyldialdehydes with a range of substituents at \\nthe 4-position.\\n2\\n In the crystalline state, the general trend was that with increased \\nsteric demand of the substituent, the accessible BET surface area substantially \\ndecreased. This was rationalised to be a consequence of the cage molecules packing \\nmore tightly together and subsequently blocking the pore windows. These \\nobservations, along with those for CC16, show that even minor alterations to the \\nstructure of the cage precursors can induce significant changes in the gas sorption \\nproperties exhibited by the resultant cage. Based on this, other 4,5-substituted CHDA \\nderivatives possessing groups of diverse steric and electronic characteristics may \\nlead to the preparation of porous materials with even greater accessible surface areas \\nor tunable gas sorption properties.  \\n4.4 Synthesis and Characterisation of Porous Organic Cage CC17 \\n(1R,2R,4S,5S)-1,2-Diaminocyclohexane-4,5-diol is particularly interesting as a \\nprecursor for POC synthesis because its two hydroxyl groups could potentially \\nfavour the binding of Lewis acidic CO2 molecules. Therefore, this POC may possess \\nselective gas sorption properties. In addition, the presence of hydroxyl groups on the \\ncage periphery could afford it as a candidate for PSM, which has been rarely \\nexplored while retaining the original imine bonded cage structure. To the best of our \\nknowledge, the lone example is provided by Schneider et al., who focussed on the \\netherification of hydroxyl groups that pointed into the cage cavity and which resulted \\nin a loss in accessible surface area.\\n7\\n Most examples of PSM start with the reduction \\nof the imine bond to a secondary amine, which may then be followed by acylation to \\nform dodecaamide cages,\\n18\\n metalation to construct a MOF\\n19\\n or “tying” with \\naldehydes or ketones in order to regenerate the shape-persistency of the cage.\\n20\\n  \\nSynthesis of Periphery-Substituted Porous Organic Cages \\n \\n89 \\n \\n \\nScheme 4.2 Reaction scheme for the synthesis of (1R,2R,4S,5S)-1,2-\\ndiaminocyclohexane-4,5-diol, 9.

Treatment of 6 with meta-chloroperbenzoic \\nacid (mCPBA) and trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) resulted in diastereoselective anti-\\ndioxylation to 7 through epoxidation of the carbon-carbon double bond, followed by \\nin-situ ring opening to afford the desired diol in a 70 % yield after flash column \\nchromatography.\\n21\\n Consecutive dihydrochloride salt formation and hydrogenolysis \\nof the chiral diamine auxiliary resulted in the isolation of the desired diamine salt 9. \\n \\nScheme 4.3 Reaction scheme for the synthesis of CC17. \\nSynthesis of Periphery-Substituted Porous Organic Cages \\n \\n90 \\n \\nFollowing the procedure for the synthesis of CC16, the DCM-methanol solvent \\nsystem proved to be unsuccessful using 9 as a precursor, with insoluble precipitate \\nobservable within minutes upon layering. Several solvent systems were attempted \\nwithout success. However, using a 100 % methanol system appeared to slow the \\nonset of precipitation. After four days, an amorphous solid, which also contained \\nsmall crystals, had formed. These were subsequently solved by scXRD (performed \\nby Dr Marc Little) to show that the desired [4+6] cage was present in the reaction \\nmixture. CC17 crystallised in the chiral tetragonal space group P43212 and was \\nheavily solvated with methanol and water molecules (Figure 4.7). \\n \\nFigure 4.7 Displacement ellipsoid plot of the asymmetric unit from the single crystal \\nstructure CC17∙(CH3OH)15.5∙(H2O)13.25.

Following a solubility screen, the cage was found to \\ndissolve in DMF, DMSO, N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) and 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol \\n(TFE). \\nAnalysis by \\n1\\nH NMR spectroscopy showed that the isolated product exhibited sharp \\nsinglets at δ 8.23 ppm and δ 7.82 ppm in a 1:1 ratio, which corresponded to the imine \\nand aromatic protons respectively. However, the singlet at δ 4.79 ppm - assigned to \\nSynthesis of Periphery-Substituted Porous Organic Cages \\n \\n91 \\n \\nthe hydroxyl groups - exhibited a noticeable shoulder peak and pronounced \\nbroadness. Analytical HPLC confirmed that in addition to a sharp peak  \\nassigned to CC17 (tR = 10.34 min), there were other broader peaks observable \\n(Figure 4.8). This was rationalised to be soluble oligomeric and polymeric  \\nby-products which had precipitated from the original reaction mixture. This also goes \\nsome way to explain the amorphous character of the material observed upon PXRD \\nanalysis. \\n \\nFigure 4.8 HPLC analysis for CC17 before and after purification via preparative \\nHPLC.

A sample of \\nthe crude product was dissolved in DMSO-methanol (2:1) and the desired diol cage \\nCC17 was isolated using a methanol-water gradient method. After the combined \\nfractions were concentrated to dryness under vacuum, CC17 was isolated as a white \\namorphous solid. However, the final recovery of CC17 was poor, with an overall \\nyield of only 17 %. Furthermore, the large quantities of solvent that were used to run \\nthe HPLC method made this approach to the isolation of CC17 undesirable.  \\nSynthesis of Periphery-Substituted Porous Organic Cages \\n \\n92 \\n \\n \\nFigure 4.9 \\n1\\nH NMR spectrum (DMSO-d6) of CC17 after purification via preparative \\nHPLC. \\nDespite the limitations of this method, analysis of the isolated material by \\n1\\nH NMR \\nspectroscopy (Figure 4.9) showed that the broadness that was previously observed \\nhad now been removed. Sharp singlets at δ 8.23 ppm and δ 7.82 ppm in a 1:1 ratio \\ncould be assigned to the imine and aromatic protons respectively. In addition, the \\nintegration for the other peaks in the spectrum was consistent with the number of \\nprotons in the desired cage structure. \\nAnalysis by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry gave a molecular ion peak of  \\nm/z = 1310, which correlates to a [4+6] cage structure (Figure 4.10) and confirmed \\nthe observations from scXRD analysis. \\nSynthesis of Periphery-Substituted Porous Organic Cages \\n \\n93 \\n \\n \\nFigure 4.10 MALDI-TOF mass spectrum of CC17 in DCTB/THF solution. \\n4.5 Synthesis and Characterisation of Porous Organic Cage CC18 \\nThe limitations of the initial approach towards the synthesis and isolation of CC17 \\nprompted a re-think as to how it could be prepared in a more efficient manner. One \\nsuch strategy involved protecting the diol functionality, synthesising a cage with the \\nresulting diamine derivative and then finally deprotecting to afford the hydroxyl-\\ndecorated cage. However, there are issues that need to be considered with this \\napproach: (i) the initial protection strategy must be selective towards the diol \\nfunctionality and not compete with the free secondary diamine; (ii) the chosen \\nprotecting group needs to be stable enough towards the conditions of further \\nsynthetic steps; (iii) the functionality of the protecting group cannot impede on \\nsuccessful cage formation, and; (iv) the solubility and stability of the resultant cage \\nmust be suitable for subsequent deprotection to the desired diol. \\nWith this is mind, tert-butyldimethylsilyl (TBDMS) ethers were rationalised to be a \\nsuitable candidate. They preferentially react with alcohols over secondary amines, \\nare stable towards hydrogenation conditions and their removal is well-explored, \\ntypically requiring a source of fluorine to effect cleavage.\\n23\\n In addition, the bulky \\nalkyl groups on the resulting cage’s periphery should ensure enhanced solubility \\nSynthesis of Periphery-Substituted Porous Organic Cages \\n \\n94 \\n \\ncharacteristics to aid the deprotection strategy employed, as well as increase the \\nsolubility of proto-cage fragments during POC synthesis.  \\nThe reaction of 7 with tert-butyldimethylsilyl chloride and imidazole led to the \\nisolation of 10 in a yield of 89 % after flash column chromatography.\\n24\\n \\nHydrogenolysis to the free diamine 11 was achieved in a 99 % yield. This was then \\nreacted with TFB to afford CC18 (Scheme 4.4). After seven days, a white precipitate \\nhad been formed. In order to maximise the yield, the volume of solvent was reduced \\nunder vacuum and a white solid, CC18, was isolated by vacuum filtration in a  \\n77 % yield after desolvation. The solubility of CC18 was noticeably better than that \\nof CC16, readily dissolving in chloroform and even in THF. \\n \\nScheme 4.4 Reaction scheme for the synthesis of CC18.

Furthermore, sharp singlets for the tert-butyl and dimethyl protons \\nshowed that the TBDMS protecting group had been retained in the final cage \\nproduct.  \\nSynthesis of Periphery-Substituted Porous Organic Cages \\n \\n95 \\n \\n \\nFigure 4.11 \\n1\\nH NMR spectrum (CDCl3) of CC18.  \\nAnalysis by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry gave a molecular ion peak of  \\nm/z = 2680, which correlates to the expected [4+6] cage structure (Figure 4.12), with \\nno other cage species observable. \\n \\nFigure 4.12 MALDI-TOF mass spectrum of CC18 in DCTB/THF solution. \\nSynthesis of Periphery-Substituted Porous Organic Cages \\n \\n96 \\n \\nPXRD analysis showed that the as-synthesised desolvated material was not  \\nphase-pure, with the diffraction pattern exhibiting distinct regions of broadness and \\ntherefore indicating that it was amorphous in nature. Suitable crystals for scXRD \\nanalysis could not be grown despite screening various solvent combinations. This is \\nnot surprising, as the TBDMS groups are flexible and hence disordered with respect \\nto one another. Gas sorption analysis of CC18 was therefore conducted without prior \\ncrystallisation to a phase-pure material.  \\n4.6 Gas Sorption Properties of CC18 \\nTable 4.2 Gas sorption values for CC18 at 1 bar. \\n SABET / m\\n2\\n g\\n-1 \\nN2 / mmol g\\n-1\\n H2 / mmol g\\n-1\\n CO2 / mmol g\\n-1\\n \\n 77 K 77 K 273 K \\n \\nCC18\\n \\n \\n364 \\n \\n8.44 \\n \\n2.84 \\n \\n1.06 \\n \\n \\nN2 sorption measurements of CC18 at 77 K and 1 bar showed a predominantly  \\nType I isotherm with little uptake at low relative pressures (Figure 4.13a), resulting \\nin an apparent BET surface area of 364 m\\n2\\n g\\n-1\\n which is less than both CC3 and \\nCC16. The H2 and CO2 uptakes were also much lower in comparison (Table 4.2). \\nAnalysis of the PSD showed that in addition to the intrinsic cage cavity (14.5 Å), \\nthere are a range of pore sizes above 20 Å (Figure 4.13b). These mesopores arise due \\nto the bulky TBDMS groups initiating inefficient packing between the cage \\nmolecules. This effect also helps to explain the hysteresis in the N2 isotherm upon \\ndesorption, the observation of which is typically associated with materials containing \\nmesopores. This behaviour can be understood by examining precedents in the \\nliterature. For a series of alkylated organic cages, Giri et al. discovered via scXRD \\nanalysis that the mobile alkyl tail ends could penetrate the cage cavity.\\n4\\n However, the \\nintroduction of bulky tert-butyl terminal branching groups prevented this \\nphenomenon.\\n25\\n In the case of CC18, the TBDMS groups may not be penetrating \\nadjacent cage cavities, but the shape of the isotherm suggests that they are generating \\nlarger pores, which may be disconnected, while occupying more of the space \\nbetween the cage molecules and thus resulting in low gas uptake at lower pressures. \\nHowever, without scXRD analysis, this conclusion is speculative. \\nSynthesis of Periphery-Substituted Porous Organic Cages \\n \\n97 \\n \\n \\nFigure 4.13 (a) Gas sorption isotherms for N2 (blue triangles) and H2 (black squares) \\nat 77 K and 1 bar for CC18.

(b) PSD for CC18 using N2 as a probe gas.  \\n4.7 Deprotection and Isolation of CC17 \\nA popular deprotection reagent for the removal of the TBDMS protecting group is \\ntetrabutylammonium fluoride (TBAF), the use of which was pioneered by Corey and \\nco-workers,\\n23\\n where the fluoride anion effects rapid cleavage of the silyl ether to the \\ndesired alcohol. Typically, the procedure is conducted at room temperature in THF. \\nThis is ideal because CC18 is soluble in THF and the use of ambient conditions \\nshould limit any potential decomposition of the cage. \\nSynthesis of Periphery-Substituted Porous Organic Cages \\n \\n98 \\n \\n \\nScheme 4.5 Reaction scheme for the deprotection of CC18. Reaction conditions:  \\n(i) 1 M TBAF, THF then 1 M aq. NH4Cl, rt, 51 %. \\nA solution of 1 M TBAF in THF, the amount of which equated to two equivalents of \\nTBAF per protecting group, was added dropwise to a cooled solution of CC18 in \\nTHF. Over a period of 24 hours, aliquots of the reaction mixture were taken and \\nanalysed by analytical HPLC. Over time, the intensity of the peak corresponding to \\nCC17, whose retention time had been previously determined (Figure 4.8), increased \\nuntil complete conversion had been achieved. After quenching with 1 M ammonium \\nchloride, the THF solvent was removed under vacuum to leave a white suspension. \\nSeveral attempts at purification via preparative HPLC failed, with impure material \\nisolated each time. This was possibly due to side-products reacting with the methanol \\nin the mobile phase and affecting the hydroxyl groups. It was found that by \\ntransferring the suspension to a centrifuge filter and successively washing with \\nwater-acetonitrile (95:5) and water, CC17 could be isolated after residual water was \\nremoved via freeze-drying. This shows that the imine bonded cage architecture is \\nstable towards excess basic TBAF, and is a rare example of a POC molecule \\nundergoing PSM with retention of the imine bonds.   \\nHowever, despite this relative success, especially in comparison to the previous \\nmethod of isolation via preparative HPLC, there are drawbacks to this approach. \\nFirstly, if water washing is not sufficient, then impurities can be retained. However, \\nanalysis of the filtrate showed that the cage is partially soluble in water, making it \\ndifficult to obtain material in high yield and purity. Secondly, conducting the \\ndeprotection on larger scales proved to be unsuccessful, as greater quantities of side-\\nproducts made washing away impurities more difficult and typically led to the \\nisolation of impure product in low yield. Thus, the isolation of CC17 would benefit \\nfrom a change in methodology. Alternative protection-deprotection strategies could \\nbe employed whereby more extreme acidic or basic conditions could be used to \\nSynthesis of Periphery-Substituted Porous Organic Cages \\n \\n99 \\n \\ninduce cleavage of the protecting group. Reducing the imine bonded cage structure \\nand post-synthetically “tying” has been shown to yield POCs which are not only \\nporous, but show improved stability towards both acidic and basic conditions.\\n20\\n Of \\ncourse, the preferred approach would be to find solvent conditions and a work-up \\nprocedure which would enable the synthesis of CC17 using the original diol diamine \\nprecursor and therefore avoid additional synthetic steps.  \\n \\nFigure 4.14 \\n1\\nH NMR spectrum (DMSO-d6) of CC17 after deprotection of CC18. \\nAnalysis by \\n1\\nH NMR spectroscopy showed that the spectrum matched that of the \\nmaterial isolated via preparative HPLC (Figure 4.14). PXRD analysis revealed that \\nthe freeze-dried sample was amorphous. As both approaches had yielded amorphous \\nmaterial, attempts were made to crystallise CC17. Although single crystals could be \\nisolated from solvent systems including TFE-THF and DMF-acetone, attempts to \\ndesolvate the cage structures through heating led to a loss of crystallinity. While \\nDMF possesses a high boiling point, TFE is expected to hydrogen bond to the \\nhydroxyl groups. Both factors make it difficult for the cage to retain its crystal \\npacking mode upon desolvation. Activation of the material through solvent \\nswapping, as demonstrated by Mastalerz and Oppel,\\n26\\n would be a better approach for \\nfuture attempts. Following multiple reaction procedures, enough CC17 was collected \\ntogether to run gas sorption analysis on the desolvated amorphous sample.  \\nSynthesis of Periphery-Substituted Porous Organic Cages \\n \\n100 \\n \\n4.8 Gas Sorption Properties of CC17 \\nTable 4.3 Gas sorption values for CC17 at 1 bar. \\n SABET / m\\n2\\n g\\n-1 \\nN2 / mmol g\\n-1\\n H2 / mmol g\\n-1\\n CO2 / mmol g\\n-1\\n \\n 77 K 77 K 273 K \\n \\nCC17\\n \\n \\n423 \\n \\n7.06 \\n \\n4.15 \\n \\n1.81 \\n \\n \\nN2 sorption measurements of CC17 at 77 K and 1 bar showed a Type I isotherm with \\na total uptake of 7.06 mmol g\\n-1\\n and an apparent BET surface area of 423 m\\n2\\n g\\n-1\\n \\n(Table 4.3). The surface area is lower in comparison to crystalline samples of both \\nCC3 and CC16. This is despite the material being in the amorphous state, which has \\npreviously been shown to enhance the surface area of CC3 due to inefficient cage \\npacking.\\n16\\n  \\n \\nFigure 4.15 Gas sorption isotherms for N2 (blue triangles) and H2 (black squares) at \\n77 K and 1 bar for CC17. Closed symbols show adsorption and open symbols show \\ndesorption isotherms respectively. \\nDue to the large number of hydroxyl groups, it is possible that CC17 could exhibit \\nhygroscopic character and adsorb moisture upon exposure to air. If the activation \\nconditions for gas adsorption are not appropriate, or the sample is exposed to air in \\nbetween measurements, then any adsorbed water may block the pores and reduce the \\nSynthesis of Periphery-Substituted Porous Organic Cages \\n \\n101 \\n \\naccessible surface area. This is in turn may explain the reduced gas uptake values in \\ncomparison to other amorphous POC materials. Using TGA, the change in mass of a \\nsample of CC17 was measured as a function of temperature to investigate the effect \\nof air exposure. The cage sample was initially heated up to 120 °C, held isothermally \\nfor one hour, cooled down to room temperature under either air or an inert nitrogen \\natmosphere, and then the method was repeated to evaluate whether any moisture had \\nbeen adsorbed. A dried sample of CC17 which had been left exposed to the \\natmosphere was shown to lose around 9 wt % upon heating, as indicated by the black \\nline in Figure 4.16. This is due to the loss of water. After cooling under air and left \\nstanding for 20 minutes, repeating this cycle resulted in a similar observation, where  \\naround 11 wt % was lost upon heating (red line). This demonstrates the hygroscopic \\nnature of the material. However, if the cage sample was kept under a nitrogen \\natmosphere throughout, little water uptake was observed (blue line). Based on these \\nobservations, activation of a CC17 sample through heating under vacuum is an \\neffective approach for the removal of all residual water. Maintaining an inert \\natmosphere between degassing and analysing the sample is also critical to ensure \\naccurate gas uptake values. As care was taken to follow these conclusions during the \\nmeasurements, the gas uptake values for CC17 are deemed to be reliable.  \\n \\nFigure 4.16 TGA data for a CC17 sample which was successively exposed to air \\n(black line), heated and cooled under air (red line) and then heated and cooled under \\na nitrogen atmosphere (blue line).  \\nSynthesis of Periphery-Substituted Porous Organic Cages \\n \\n102 \\n \\nThe decrease in surface area may therefore be a direct consequence of interactions \\nbetween the hydroxyl groups on adjacent cage molecules. For CC10, a [4+6] cage \\npossessing bis(4-fluorophenyl) vertices, analysis by scXRD found that hydrogen \\nbonding between the peripheral fluorine atoms and C-H bonds effectively sealed the \\nextrinsic pore channels to guest molecules, resulting in a loss of surface area in \\ncomparison to an analogous cage, CC9, which had biphenyl vertices with no fluorine \\npresent.\\n12\\n Therefore, hydrogen bonding interactions between the hydroxyl groups \\nmay be reducing the accessible surface area, rather than generating additional \\nextrinsic porosity as in CC16. \\nThis feature may rationalise the lack of improvement in CO2 uptake for CC17. The \\npresence of polar hydroxyl groups would be expected to promote the adsorption of \\nLewis acidic CO2 molecules. This was demonstrated by Schneider et al., who \\nshowed that by replacing interior hydroxy groups with methoxy ones, the decrease in \\npolarity resulted in a loss in CO2 uptake, as well as a decrease in the isosteric heat of \\nadsorption.\\n7\\n In the case of CC17, if the CO2 cannot access these polar groups, then \\nno noticeable improvement is likely to be observed. Only scXRD analysis would be \\nable to definitively confirm this conclusion. \\n4.9 Synthesis and Characterisation of Porous Organic Cage CC19 \\n9,10-Dihydro-9,10-ethanoanthracene-11,12-diamine (12) has been investigated with \\nrespect to a number of different applications, including its use as a chiral backbone in \\nligands for asymmetric catalysis\\n27\\n and as a component in chiral stationary phases for \\nHPLC.\\n28\\n  \\n \\nFigure 4.17 Structure of 9,10-dihydro-9,10-ethanoanthracene-11,12-diamine (12). \\nWith respect to other POCs, 12 was previously explored within our research group as \\na precursor towards their synthesis, but successful cage formation was not achieved. \\nThis diamine is of particular interest, as the ethanoanthracene group could \\nSynthesis of Periphery-Substituted Porous Organic Cages \\n \\n103 \\n \\nconceivably frustrate the molecular packing to an even greater extent than that \\nobserved for CC16 and potentially lead to superior gas sorption properties.  \\nRecently, Kohl et al. utilised 12, along with other aromatic diamines, in the \\npreparation of a series of shape-persistent triptycene derivatives.\\n29\\n These were found \\nto possess high internal molecular free volumes and therefore pack inefficiently in \\nthe solid state. The introduction of 12 resulted in denser packing and a lower \\napparent BET surface area of 293 m\\n2\\n g\\n-1 \\ncompared to less sterically-endowed \\nanalogues. This was rationalised on the basis of a difference in its molecular \\ngeometry.  \\nA cage synthesis screen was conducted using TFB and the (S)-enantiomer of 12, \\nwhich was purchased from TCI-UK. The screen was carried out with mainly \\nchlorinated solvents over a range of concentrations, with or without the presence of \\nan acid catalyst or activated molecular sieves. Analysis of the reaction mixtures by \\n1\\nH NMR spectroscopy showed consumption of the aldehyde, with multiple imine \\nand aromatic proton environments indicating that a number of different species were \\npresent. The equilibrium of the reaction could be shifted towards a single product \\nusing DCM as a solvent, along with a catalytic amount of TFA. Other species were \\nstill observable under these conditions but were less prominent. Despite the presence \\nof these undesired species, they could be efficiently removed by swapping the \\nsolvent to acetone. With the impurities remaining in solution, the pure cage product \\nCC19 precipitated as a white solid and was isolated in a 33 % yield. \\n \\nScheme 4.6 Reaction scheme for the synthesis of CC19.  \\nAnalysis by \\n1\\nH NMR spectroscopy confirmed the isolation of the pure cage, with \\nsharp singlets at δ 8.28 ppm and δ 7.80 ppm confirming the presence of imine and \\naromatic protons respectively in a 1:1 ratio (Figure 4.18).

Crystallisation of the cage from DCM-acetone (vial-in-vial) gave needle-\\nlike crystals which were characterised by scXRD (performed by Dr Marc Little; \\nFigure 4.19). CC19 crystallised in the chiral trigonal space group P321 and was \\nfound to be a cage comprised of eight molecules of TFB and twelve molecules of the \\n(S,S)-diamine. \\nImine bond-based cages possessing an [8+12] stoichiometry are rare and none have \\nyet been proven to be porous in the solid state. This is typically due to a lack of \\nshape-persistency upon desolvation. An early example was presented by Xu et al., \\nwho synthesised a polyimine chiral nanocube using an edge-directed approach, \\nwhere eight tritopic C3-triformylcyclobenzylene units were linked together by twelve \\nlinear aromatic diamines.\\n30\\n Although crystals suitable for scXRD could not be \\nobtained, its structure was elucidated through DOSY and MD calculations and was \\nfound to possess a molecular diameter of 3.7 nm. Skowronek et al. synthesised a \\nlarge cuboctahedral [8+12] cage from the reaction of cis,cis-1,3,5-\\ntriaminocyclohexane and 4-tert-butyl-2,6-diformylphenol.\\n31\\n The resultant cage was \\ndetermined by scXRD to have a large intrinsic cage cavity and an outer diameter of \\n3.0 nm. However, a desolvated structure was not reported. Jelfs et al. used an \\nextended building block approach in the preparation of two large [8+12] cage \\nmolecules, CC7 and CC8, which were synthesised from the reaction of an extended \\ntrialdehyde with an amine core, tri(4-formylphenyl)amine, with (R,R)-1,2-\\ncyclohexanediamine and (R,R)-1,2-cyclohexenediamine respectively.\\n32\\n Although \\nsuccessfully characterised by scXRD and displaying inner and outer diameters of  \\n1.5 nm and 2.9 nm respectively, rapid solvent loss and subsequent instability of the \\nCC7 crystals upon removal from the reaction mixture resulted in structural collapse \\nto an amorphous material. The collapse of these larger cavities upon desolvation was \\nrationalised to be due to the inherent flexibility of the bonds, with the loss of void \\nspace promoted by favourable π-π stacking interactions between opposing aromatic \\nfaces. \\nInterestingly, the stoichiometry of the most thermodynamically stable cage product \\ncan also be altered depending on the diamine choice. Using (R,R)-1,2-\\ncyclopentanediamine, instead of (R,R)-1,2-cyclohexanediamine as for CC7, in \\nconjunction with tri(4-formylphenyl)amine yields CC5, a [4+6] cage which is stable \\nSynthesis of Periphery-Substituted Porous Organic Cages \\n \\n106 \\n \\ntowards desolvation and exhibits an apparent BET surface area of  \\n1333 m\\n2\\n g\\n-1\\n.\\n33\\n This behaviour was rationalised on the basis of subtle differences in \\nbond angle between the respective cage vertices, which when amplified through a \\nlarger multi-component structure can result in significant changes to the final cage \\nstoichiometry. In the case of CC19, this is the first example of an [8+12] imine \\nbond-based cage prepared from the TFB precursor. This occurrence may again be \\ndue to a difference in bond angle, with 12 possessing the correct geometry to enable \\nthe preferential self-assembly of a larger cage containing more components. \\n \\nFigure 4.20 PXRD data monitoring the structural changes for CC19 when exposed \\nto air at room temperature.  \\nAs CC7 was found to collapse to an amorphous state upon solvent loss, solvated \\ncrystals of CC19 prepared from DCM-acetone (vial-in-vial) were packed into an \\nopen capillary. Powder patterns were then run successively to monitor any structural \\nchanges (performed by Dr Sam Chong). The crystallinity of the sample was retained \\nSynthesis of Periphery-Substituted Porous Organic Cages \\n \\n107 \\n \\nover a short period of time (Figure 4.20). However, after sixty hours, the sample was \\nobserved to be amorphous due to presumed structural rearrangement upon solvent \\nloss. Solvent exchange using n-pentane, which has been successfully utilised for the \\nactivation of other large cages with retention of shape-persistence, also proved to be \\nunsuccessful. This demonstrated that the crystallinity could not be retained during a \\ngas sorption measurement, as the cage would not survive the activation conditions, \\nhowever mild the approach. Furthermore, these observations infer that the inherent \\nflexibility of imine bonds is unsuitable for the construction of large organic cages. \\nAccording to Jelfs et al., there are a number of design features which should be \\nconsidered in order to prevent structural collapse, including: (i) preventing rotation in \\nthe plane of the cage face; (ii) using larger polyaromatic building blocks to promote \\nrigidity, and; (iii) discouraging non-covalent interactions which favour cage \\ncollapse.\\n32\\n \\nRecently, Zhang et al. reported the synthesis of an [8+12] cage composed of \\nboronate ester bonds. The reaction of a tetraol precursor with a triboronic acid \\nafforded a mesoporous cage with an internal cavity size of 2.3 nm that could be \\nactivated by solvent exchange.\\n34\\n The apparent BET surface area of 3758 m\\n2\\n g\\n-1\\n is the \\nhighest measured to date for this class of porous material. This result endorsed the \\nrecommendations of Jelfs et al. by highlighting the importance of structural rigidity, \\nwith the cage’s fixed bonds and cuboctahedral geometry playing a vital role in its \\nshape-persistency,\\n35\\n as well as the use of appropriate conditions to activate the \\nmaterial. Therefore, any future approach towards the synthesis of large cages must \\nkeep these factors in mind. \\n4.10 Gas Sorption Properties of CC19 \\nTable 4.4 Gas sorption values for CC19 at 1 bar. \\n SABET / m\\n2\\n g\\n-1 \\nN2 / mmol g\\n-1\\n H2 / mmol g\\n-1\\n CO2 / mmol g\\n-1\\n \\n 77 K 77 K 273 K \\n \\nCC19\\n \\n \\n10 \\n \\n0.45 \\n \\n2.61 \\n \\n1.03 \\n \\n \\nN2 sorption measurements of CC19 at 77 K and 1 bar mirrored the observations for \\nthe collapsed cage structures, CC7 and CC8, in that it was formally non-porous \\n(Figure 4.21).

On \\nSynthesis of Periphery-Substituted Porous Organic Cages \\n \\n108 \\n \\nthe other hand, CC19 was found to adsorb small amounts of H2 and CO2 (Table 4.4), \\nindicating that the sterically-demanding ethanoanthracene vertices may generate \\npores of appropriate size to allow the adsorption of smaller gas molecules.  \\n \\nFigure 4.21 Gas sorption isotherms for N2 (blue triangles) and H2 (black squares) at \\n77 K and 1 bar for CC19. Closed symbols show adsorption and open symbols show \\ndesorption isotherms respectively. \\n4.11 Conclusions and Outlook \\nEnantiomerically-pure derivatives of the POC precursor CHDA were prepared, or \\npurchased from a commercial source, and successfully reacted with TFB in the \\nsynthesis of four new POC molecules. CC16 was isolated as a phase-pure [4+6] cage \\nusing (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2-diamino-4,5-dimethylcyclohexane (4) as the precursor. The \\nintroduction of methyl groups onto the cage’s periphery resulted in frustrated \\nmolecular packing and generated an extra pore channel in addition to the 3-D \\ndiamondoid pore network running through the intrinsic cage voids. This subtle \\nstructural alteration resulted in an improvement in gas sorption properties in \\ncomparison to its parent cage CC3, with an apparent BET surface area of  \\n1023 m\\n2\\n g\\n-1\\n among the highest measured to date for this class of porous material. On \\nthe other hand, the utilisation of (1R,2R,4S,5S)-1,2-diaminocyclohexane-4,5-diol (9) \\nin POC synthesis, in an effort to replace the methyl groups with hydroxyls, proved \\nSynthesis of Periphery-Substituted Porous Organic Cages \\n \\n109 \\n \\nproblematic. The direct preparation of CC17 was difficult to control and resulted in \\nco-precipitation of crystalline cage and amorphous oligomeric material. Although \\npure CC17 could be subsequently isolated by preparative HPLC, low recovery and \\nhigh solvent consumption prompted a change in direction with regards to its \\npreparation. By adopting a protection-deprotection strategy, the hydroxyl groups of 9 \\nwere converted to TBDMS ethers and the resulting diamine (11) was successfully \\nused in the synthesis of CC18. This cage showed no real improvements with respect \\nto gas sorption properties, although its superior solubility enabled successful \\ndeprotection and the isolation of pure CC17. Despite this being achieved in an \\naverage yield and on small scales, this is a rare example of PSM being performed on \\na POC molecule. Analysis of the gas sorption properties of this cage in the \\namorphous state failed to show any selectivity towards a particular gas. This was \\nrationalised on the effect of hydrogen bonding interactions between the hydroxyl \\ngroups reducing the accessible surface area, instead of frustrating the molecular \\npacking and improving it, as was the case with the methyl groups in CC16. Attempts \\nto characterise desolvated crystals of CC17 also proved unsuccessful due to a loss of \\ncrystallinity upon thermal treatment. Finally, using (11S,12S)-9,10-dihydro-9,10-\\nethanoanthracene-11,12-diamine (12) as a precursor, an [8+12] cage, CC19, was \\nsuccessfully isolated as one of the biggest imine bond-based cages prepared to date. \\nDue to the inherent flexibility of the bonds, structural collapse upon desolvation \\nrendered it amorphous and consequentially non-porous. Despite this, its synthesis \\nprovides additional evidence regarding the need for appropriate rigidity and \\ngeometry towards large, shape-persistent organic cage structures.  \\nThe synthesis and impressive gas sorption properties of CC16 highlights how small \\nchanges in structure can trigger improvements in porosity. Introducing other \\nfunctional groups at the 4,5\\n36\\n or even 3,6 positions\\n37\\n of CHDA in the synthesis of \\nother POCs would allow further investigation of this effect and may result in superior \\nmaterials. Although the isolation of CC17 proved to be non-trivial, it is still an \\ninteresting material, and opens up possibilities for tuning the gas sorption properties \\nor targeting a specific hybrid material or application through PSM.\\n38\\n Isolating it as a \\nphase-pure material will prove to be important, as the gas sorption properties in the \\namorphous state were not particularly significant. This will involve finding a better \\napproach to its synthesis, either by developing conditions that would allow a \\nSynthesis of Periphery-Substituted Porous Organic Cages \\n \\n110 \\n \\ncontrolled synthesis using the original diol diamine, or by using an alternative \\nprotection-deprotection strategy. POC molecules which have been post-synthetically \\ntied have shown improved stabilities towards conditions that may enable a more \\neffective approach. Due to CC17 being soluble in mainly high boiling point solvents, \\nactivation upon crystallisation may also benefit from a methodology which puts less \\nstress on the cage structure, with solvent swapping or supercritical drying potentially \\nbeing more appropriate.\\n39\\n  \\n4.12 Experimental \\n4.12.1 Materials \\n(S)-1-Phenylethylamine, 20 % palladium hydroxide on carbon and (11S,12S)-9,10-\\ndihydro-9,10-ethanoanthracene-11,12-diamine were purchased from TCI-UK.

Xe and Kr occur naturally in the atmosphere (0.087 ppmv \\nand 1.14 ppmv respectively) and can be generated as by-products in the cryogenic \\ndistillation of air to separate nitrogen and oxygen.\\n2\\n However, this process is energy-\\nintensive, costly and the purity of the resulting gases may be insufficient for some \\napplications.\\n3\\n \\nCryogenic distillation has also been applied to the capture and separation of Xe and \\nKr from process off-gas streams during the reprocessing of UNF. The various \\ndisadvantages of this technique have led researchers to investigate alternative \\ntechnologies. Recently, there has been an increasing focus on the use of microporous \\nmaterials for the separation of Xe and Kr from air, and from each other, under \\nambient conditions via selective physical adsorption. Although more traditional \\nactivated carbon and zeolite materials were initially assessed,\\n4-6\\n MOFs have recently \\nreceived significant attention. The ability to fine-tune their properties in a \\ncontrollable manner makes them ideal candidates as selective adsorbents and they are \\nthe best-performing microporous materials tested for Xe/Kr separation to date.\\n7-10\\n \\nComplementary experimental and simulation studies of both known and theoretical \\nMOF structures have concluded that the ideal material for Xe/Kr separation should \\npossess, amongst other properties, a high concentration of open metal sites on the \\npore surface, as well as narrow pores of uniform width which are large enough to \\naccommodate a single Xe atom.\\n11\\n  \\nPOCs are discrete molecules which pack together in the solid state via non-covalent \\ninteractions to generate extended structures which, upon desolvation, can display \\nhigh surface areas in the crystalline state.\\n12-14\\n Guest molecules are able to access the \\npre-fabricated and intrinsic cage void via windows within the cage structure. The \\ncage packing mode, and hence the structure of the guest accessible pore network, is \\ncurrently difficult to predict and requires computationally expensive calculations, \\nalthough it has been shown that the crystallisation of POCs from certain solvents can \\nafford porous materials with tailored and defined pore sizes.\\n15\\n Using computational \\nSeparation of Xenon from Krypton using Porous Organic Cages \\n \\n125 \\n \\nmodelling studies based on their single crystal structures, it can be predicted whether \\nPOCs are suitable for a particular application. Despite the lack of open metal sites, \\nthe pore structures of certain POCs have deemed them as excellent candidates for \\nXe/Kr separation.  \\n5.2 Xe/Kr Separation using Porous Organic Cages \\nThe ability of CC3 to separate organic molecules\\n16\\n and act as a host for guests such \\nas halogens\\n17\\n has been previously reported. In its α-phase, these properties are a \\ndirect consequence of the dimensions of the 3-D diamondoid pore network which \\nruns through the intrinsic cage voids. The effect of its pore size in relation to its \\ncapacity to adsorb certain gas molecules has also been investigated by MD \\nsimulations. \\n \\nFigure 5.1 (a) The largest inclusion sphere inside the cage (dark purple mesh) is the \\ncorrect size to accommodate a single Xe atom (cyan sphere). (b) Two pore cavities \\nexist in the 3-D diamondoid pore structure of CC3: the intrinsic cage cavity (dark \\npurple) and a window cavity between adjacent cage windows (light purple).  \\n(c) MD simulations (298 K, 1 bar) show a PLE (blue) that encompasses the \\nminimum molecular dimensions of all noble gases. The straight vertical line \\ncorresponds to the PLD. (d) For Xe, the pore windows are “open” for a small fraction \\n(7 %) of the simulated time period.\\n18\\n \\nSeparation of Xenon from Krypton using Porous Organic Cages \\n \\n126 \\n \\nViewed as a static structure, it is not immediately apparent that CC3 should exhibit \\nany significant levels of porosity towards certain gases. The accessible surface area \\ninside CC3 can be described as having a bottleneck appearance, with the narrowest \\npoint in the pore channels lying between the cage and window cavities (Figure 5.1b). \\nThe dimensions of this, denoted as the PLD, was calculated by Holden et al. to have \\na value of 3.62 Å (Figure 5.1c).\\n19\\n Considering the kinetic diameter of N2 is 3.64 Å, \\nanalysis of the static structure suggested that CC3 should be formally non-porous to \\nN2. However, gas sorption studies of CC3 have shown this not to be the case.\\n20\\n The \\nindividual cage molecules themselves are not static bodies and their structures \\npossess a degree of flexibility. By allowing for the vibrational motion of the atoms in \\nthe cage molecules, MD simulations demonstrated that the size of the pore channel \\nchanges over time, ranging from a minimum of 3.0 Å to a maximum diameter of  \\n4.5 Å (Figure 5.1c). This was termed the PLE and showed that the size of the pore \\ncan expand above the “static” average level of 3.62 Å. In turn, the narrowest point in \\nthe 3-D pore structure was open to N2 for a certain amount of the simulated time \\nperiod, providing N2 with the chance to opportunistically hop between cage cavities \\nand afford CC3 with its impressive adsorption properties.  \\nIn a following investigation, Holden et al. used MD simulations to investigate the \\ndiffusion of six gas molecules in CC3 using a flexible host model.\\n21\\n The noble gases \\nKr and Xe, with diameters of 3.69 Å and 4.10 Å respectively, were included in this \\nstudy. The dimensions of these rare gases are greater than that of the PLD, but \\nsmaller than the maximum value of the PLE (Figure 5.1c). It was calculated that the \\ncage windows were open to Kr for 59 % of the simulated time period, whereas for \\nXe they were open for only 7 % (Figure 5.1d).\\n21\\n In practice, this means that both \\nnoble gases are able to diffuse between adjacent cage molecules, with Xe diffusing \\nmore slowly due to its larger size.  \\nOn closer inspection of its pore dimensions, the internal cavity of CC3 has an \\ninclusion sphere with a diameter of 4.40 Å, which is close to the diameter of Xe  \\n(Figure 5.1a). If you include the small time period within which the narrowest point \\nin the pore channel is large enough to accommodate the diffusion of Xe, it can be \\nargued that this satisfies the conclusions of Sikora et al., who noted that the ideal \\npore structure for Xe/Kr separation needs to be uniform and just large enough to \\naccommodate a single Xe atom.\\n22\\n Despite the lack of open metal sites, which have \\nSeparation of Xenon from Krypton using Porous Organic Cages \\n \\n127 \\n \\nbeen shown to promote the preferential adsorption of Xe over Kr, kinetically, it is \\npossible that Xe may be separated from Kr based on a pore-confinement effect. By \\ntaking advantage of the larger size and lower diffusivity of Xe in relation to Kr, it is \\npossible that they can be efficiently separated using CC3. \\n5.3 Xenon and Krypton Uptake in CC3 \\nAs a result of the simulation studies by Holden et al., CC3 was investigated as a \\ncandidate for Xe/Kr separation in collaboration with Dr Praveen Thallapally at the \\nPacific Northwest National Laboratory. Synthesised in accordance with the literature \\nprocedure,\\n20\\n the ability of a CC3 powder sample to adsorb Xe and Kr was initially \\nmeasured using a static gravimetric method. \\n \\nFigure 5.2 Xe and Kr adsorption isotherms for CC3 at 298 K and 1 bar. \\nAt 298 K and 1 bar, CC3 was found to preferentially adsorb Xe (2.25 mmol g\\n-1\\n,  \\n30 wt %) over Kr (0.84 mmol g\\n-1\\n, 7 wt %). The higher Xe uptake is due to stronger \\nvan der Waals interactions as a consequence of its higher polarisability. Whereas the \\nXe isotherm approaches saturation at 1 bar, the Kr isotherm does not, and this is due \\nto its lack of adsorption capability. These values correlate with the volumetric Xe \\nand Kr uptakes measured prior to this study (2.43 mmol g\\n-1\\n and 0.93 mmol g\\n-1\\n \\nrespectively). These results also validate the predictions of Holden et al. by \\ndemonstrating that the flexible nature of the cage molecules does indeed allow larger \\nSeparation of Xenon from Krypton using Porous Organic Cages \\n \\n128 \\n \\nguests such as Xe to diffuse through the pore structure and be adsorbed. Of course, \\nthis method only considers the thermodynamic equilibrium effect. For commercial \\napplications, including the capture of Xe and Kr from process off-gas streams, \\nkinetic effects also need to be accounted for. Not only are you dealing with the \\npresence of other gases (N2, O2, CO2, Ar) competing for adsorption sites, but the \\nrespective diffusion properties of these gases must also be considered. To account for \\nthis, dynamic breakthrough measurements were conducted. \\n5.4 Xe/Kr Breakthrough Measurements using CC3 \\nPrior to performing dynamic breakthrough measurements, the powder sample was \\nprocessed into 600 – 850 μm pellets to minimise pressure drop and potential \\ncontamination of the instrument during the measurements (Section 2.1.7). This \\nprocess has been shown to leave the physical and chemical properties of MOFs \\nunaffected in relation to the original powder sample.\\n23\\n  \\n \\nFigure 5.3 Apparatus for Xe/Kr breakthrough measurements.\\n24\\n  \\nIn reference to the apparatus illustrated in Figure 5.3, the gases are introduced \\nthrough the bottom inlet of the adsorption bed, which consists of the cage pellets held \\nbetween two layers of quartz wool and two sample holders.\\n25\\n The inlet gas stream is \\ncontrolled using specialised computer software, while the composition of the outlet \\nstream is analysed by mass spectrometry. To determine whether the CC3 pellets \\nwere appropriate for breakthrough measurements, in terms of both retention time and \\nthe uptake in comparison to the static gravimetric method, pure Xe and Kr \\nbreakthrough curves were collected separately at 298 K and 1 bar (Figure 5.4). \\nSeparation of Xenon from Krypton using Porous Organic Cages \\n \\n129 \\n \\n \\nFigure 5.4 Pure Xe and Kr breakthrough curves for CC3 at 298 K and 1 bar. The \\nflow rate of Xe and Kr is 20 sccm. \\nIt can be seen in Figure 5.4 that Xe is retained within the adsorption bed for a longer \\ntime than Kr. This not only confirms that CC3 can adsorb more Xe than Kr, but that \\nthe diffusion rate of Xe is slower than Kr. The Xe and Kr uptakes using this method \\nwere calculated by integrating the areas above their respective breakthrough curves, \\nas demonstrated in previous publications.\\n25\\n Based on the mass balance, the gas \\nadsorption properties can be determined as follows: \\n \\nq = \\nC0Vts\\n22.4W\\n           (5.1) \\nts = ∫ (1 - \\nF\\nF0\\n)\\nt\\n0\\n dt          (5.2) \\nwhere ts is the stoichiometric time (min), C0 is the feed gas concentration, F0 and F \\nare the inlet and outlet gas molar flow rates respectively, q is the equilibrium \\nadsorption capacity of gas (mmol g\\n-1\\n), t is the adsorption time (min) which is from \\ntime zero to time when equilibrium is reached, V is the volumetric feed flow rate \\n(cm\\n3\\n min\\n-1\\n) at standard temperature and pressure (273 K and 1 atm) and W is the \\nweight of the activated adsorbent (g).\\n25\\n \\n \\nSeparation of Xenon from Krypton using Porous Organic Cages \\n \\n130 \\n \\nTable 5.1 Pure Xe and Kr breakthrough capacities for different porous materials at  \\n298 K and 1 bar.\\n24\\n \\nMaterial Xe Uptake / mmol g\\n-1\\n Kr Uptake / mmol g\\n-1\\n \\n \\nNi/DOBDC \\nHKUST-1 \\nActivated Carbon \\n \\n3.83 \\n3.18 \\n3.72 \\n \\n1.69 \\n1.92 \\n2.62 \\nCC3 2.56 1.06 \\n \\n \\nFrom the pure breakthrough curves, the Xe and Kr uptakes of CC3 were calculated \\nto be 2.56 mmol g\\n-1\\n and 1.06 mmol g\\n-1 \\nrespectively. These dynamic capacities are in \\nfairly good agreement with the values determined from the pure gas adsorption \\nisotherms of the powder sample. The Xe uptake in CC3 is lower than other porous \\nmaterials studied under identical conditions (Table 5.1). This is a consequence of the \\nlower number of available adsorption sites in CC3, as well as the absence of open \\nmetal sites which are prominent in the MOFs listed above. The Kr uptake in CC3 is \\nalso much lower in comparison and this can be attributed to a lack of these key \\nproperties. This is beneficial, as the ideal Xe/Kr selectivity is higher for CC3 (2.42) \\nthan the other listed materials. The high selectivity is due to CC3 having the optimal \\npore dimensions for the adsorption of Xe, while there are no smaller cavities which \\nmay preferentially adsorb Kr. This results in a lower Kr uptake and therefore a higher \\nXe/Kr selectivity. \\nThe next stage was to perform breakthrough measurements of Xe and Kr mixtures of \\ndifferent compositions (Xe/Kr = 80:20, 50:50 and 20:80) to analyse whether \\nseparation could be achieved with both gases present. It can be seen in Figures 5.5a-c \\nthat effective separation of Xe from Kr was achieved at all compositions. The \\nbreakthrough result for Xe/Kr (20:80), an industrially-relevant composition, mirrors \\nthat of the pure Xe and Kr breakthrough curves, with Xe breaking through after Kr \\n(Figure 5.5c). This is confirmed by the characteristic roll-up in the Kr breakthrough \\ncurve, which is caused by the displacement of Kr by Xe.\\n26\\n This phenomenon was \\nobserved for each binary mixture. Once the Kr breaks through, its outlet \\nconcentration exceeds its inlet concentration, as more Kr molecules are displaced by \\nthe Xe molecules which are slowly diffusing through the pore structure and \\npreferentially occupying the adsorption sites instead of Kr. In addition, as the Xe \\nSeparation of Xenon from Krypton using Porous Organic Cages \\n \\n131 \\n \\nconcentration in the gas mixture decreases, the time it takes to break through the \\nadsorption bed and reach equilibrium increases. With a lower concentration of Xe in \\nthe gas mixture, there is less competition to occupy adsorption sites and initiate \\ndisplacement of other Xe atoms, resulting in Xe diffusing through the adsorption bed \\nmore slowly and becoming concentrated within the pores. Diversely, the Kr moves \\nthrough faster, as its greater concentration, combined with a higher diffusivity and \\nlack of adsorption capability, allows it to break through much more rapidly. \\n \\nFigure 5.5 (a-c) Xe/Kr breakthrough curves for CC3 under different Xe and Kr \\ncompositions: (a) Xe/Kr (80:20); (b) Xe/Kr (50:50), and; (c) Xe/Kr (20:80). The flow \\nrate of Xe and Kr together is 40 sccm and experiments were conducted at 298 K and \\n1 bar. (d) Xe/Kr selectivity comparison for CC3 under different Xe and Kr \\ncompositions.  \\nFrom these breakthrough curves, the respective dynamic capacities of Xe and Kr, \\ndetermined using Equations 5.1 and 5.2, can be utilised to calculate the Xe/Kr \\nselectivity using the standard definition: \\nSAB = \\nxA / yA\\nxB / yB\\n           (5.3) \\nwhere xA and xB are the mole fractions of gases A and B in the adsorbed phase and yA \\nand yB are the mole fractions of gases A and B in the bulk phase.\\n25\\n \\nSeparation of Xenon from Krypton using Porous Organic Cages \\n \\n132 \\n \\n \\nEquation 5.3 represents the overall selectivity, with both thermodynamic and kinetic \\nselectivities taken into account. This is characteristic of breakthrough measurements. \\nThese selectivities follow opposite trends for Xe and Kr, with Xe possessing a higher \\npolarisability but a lower diffusivity compared to Kr. Therefore, not only is the \\nadsorption performance considered, but also the kinetic behaviour of the gas \\nmolecules within the material itself. This is a more accurate measure of selectivity \\ncompared to some simulation studies, which calculate the selectivity of mixture \\nadsorption from single component isotherms at a given pressure.\\n27\\n  \\n \\nTable 5.2 Xe and Kr uptakes and selectivities for CC3 at 298 K and 1 bar under \\ndifferent Xe and Kr compositions. \\n \\nXe/Kr \\nFeed Ratio \\nXe Uptake / \\nmmol g\\n-1\\n \\nKr Uptake / \\nmmol g\\n-1\\n \\nXe/Kr \\nSelectivity \\n \\n80:20 \\n \\n1.93 \\n \\n0.31 \\n \\n1.67 \\n50:50 1.67 0.54 3.08 \\n20:80 \\n \\n1.24 0.86 5.29 \\n \\nIt can be seen in Table 5.2 that as the Xe composition in the mixture decreases, its \\nuptake also falls. This is due to its lower concentration. Of greater interest, the  \\nXe/Kr selectivity is observed to increase. For example, the Xe/Kr (20:80) selectivity \\nfor CC3 (5.29) exceeds the measured selectivity of Ni/DOBDC (4)\\n24\\n but is lower \\nthan that of MOF-505 (9-10).\\n8\\n The improvement in selectivity is due to the lower \\nconcentration of Xe molecules preferentially occupying the cage cavities instead of \\nKr. Over time, the adsorption bed becomes saturated with Xe, until it finally breaks \\nthrough after around two minutes (Figure 5.5c). Once equilibrium is reached, the Xe \\nuptake in relation to its initial concentration far exceeds that of Kr and therefore \\nresults in a high selectivity. At this concentration, the effect of the pore structure \\nbecomes increasingly significant. Despite the presence of open metal sites, which \\npreferentially adsorb Xe, the diameter of the hexagonal pores in Ni/DOBDC (11 Å) \\nis much larger than the pore dimensions of CC3 and MOF-505. This means that the \\ndiffusion of Xe through the pore channels in Ni/DOBDC is not hindered in the same \\nway as it is in CC3, where the Xe atom needs to opportunistically hop between cage \\ncavities in the small time period within which the cage windows are wide enough to \\nfacilitate diffusion. This validates the conclusion of Sikora et al. that pores which are \\nSeparation of Xenon from Krypton using Porous Organic Cages \\n \\n133 \\n \\njust large enough to accommodate a single Xe atom are required for effective \\nseparation.\\n22\\n The superior selectivity observed for MOF-505 can therefore be \\nascribed to the presence of open metal sites in conjunction with its narrow pore size.  \\nUnder these conditions, the kinetic effect predominates over the thermodynamic \\neffect. Although the Xe uptake from the pure breakthrough curves was lower in \\ncomparison to the aforementioned MOFs, the higher Xe/Kr selectivity observed for \\nCC3 means that this porous material may be an ideal candidate for the separation of \\nlow concentrations of Xe and Kr from process off-gas streams during the \\nreprocessing of UNF. \\n \\nFigure 5.6 Xe (400 ppm) and Kr (40 ppm) in simulated air breakthrough curves for \\nCC3 at 298 K and 1 bar. The He flow rate is 40 sccm and the flow rate of Xe and Kr \\ntogether in air is 40 sccm. \\nTo imitate this separation, breakthrough measurements for low concentrations of Xe \\n(400 ppm) and Kr (40 ppm) in simulated air (N2, 78 %; O2, 21 %; Ar, 0.9 %; CO2, \\n0.03 %; etc.) were performed, mirroring the conditions that would be encountered in \\nthe reprocessing of UNF.\\n24\\n According to the breakthrough curves (Figure 5.6), N2 \\nand O2 break through the adsorption bed immediately, closely followed by CO2 and \\nKr. Remarkably, Xe was not detected until over fifteen minutes after the other \\ncomponents, despite using a flow rate of 40 sccm, which is twice the rate used for \\nNi/DOBDC, the best performing material to date.\\n24\\n Under these conditions, the \\nSeparation of Xenon from Krypton using Porous Organic Cages \\n \\n134 \\n \\noverall Xe uptake for CC3 (11 mmol kg\\n-1\\n) is greater than that of Ni/DOBDC  \\n(4.8 mmol kg\\n-1\\n). In addition, the calculated Xe/Kr selectivity for CC3 (20.4) is also \\nhigher (Table 5.3). Selectivity and capacity are often seen as a trade-off, but CC3 \\ndisplays major improvements with respect to both. \\nTable 5.3 Comparison of the Xe uptake and Xe/Kr selectivity between Ni/DOBDC \\nand CC3 from Xe (400 ppm) and Kr (40 ppm) in simulated air breakthrough curves. \\nMaterial Xe Uptake / mmol kg\\n-1\\n Xe/Kr Selectivity \\n \\nNi/DOBDC\\n24\\n \\n \\n4.8 \\n \\n7.3 \\nCC3 11 20.4 \\n \\n \\nThis improvement in separation performance was rationalised to be a consequence of \\nthe near-perfect fit between the cavities in CC3 and the Xe guest.\\n18\\n Under the \\nbreakthrough conditions, Xe slowly diffuses between the cage cavities, while the \\nsmaller Kr continues to flow rapidly through the pore channels as a result of its \\nsmaller diameter and the lack of available adsorption sites. Xe is not easily displaced \\nfrom the pore cavities by the other components of air and becomes concentrated \\nwithin CC3, with the selectivity increasing as a result. On the other hand, the large \\npores in Ni/DOBDC enable Xe to be more easily displaced by the other components \\nof air and lower the overall Xe uptake. Here, a pore-confinement effect has been \\nshown to dominate and proves that high surface areas and open metal sites are not \\nprerequisites for superior performance.\\n9\\n  \\n \\n5.5 Xenon and Krypton Uptake in CC1β \\nAs a comparison, Xe and Kr uptakes were also measured for CC1β. CC1 was first \\nreported by Tozawa et al. and is synthesised via the [4+6] cycloimination reaction of \\nTFB with EDA.\\n28\\n Upon crystallisation from an ethyl acetate solution, the isolated \\ncage was found to pack in window-to-arene stacks with disconnected lattice voids, \\nand was therefore formally non-porous to N2. However, by exposing CC1 to DCM \\nvapour, it could be transformed into a new polymorph, CC1β, which possessed an \\ninterconnected channel structure (Figure 5.7).\\n29\\n  \\nSeparation of Xenon from Krypton using Porous Organic Cages \\n \\n135 \\n \\n \\nFigure 5.7 Representation of the packing arrangement of CC1β, with interconnected \\nchannels shown in yellow.  \\nAlthough formally non-porous to N2, CC1β adsorbs a significant quantity of H2 \\n(5.59 mmol g\\n-1\\n, 1.18 wt %) at 77 K and 1 bar.\\n29\\n Its relevance to Xe/Kr separation was \\nconfirmed by running volumetric adsorption isotherms for each gas. At 298 K and  \\n1 bar, CC1β was found to adsorb Xe (2.09 mmol g-1) in preference to Kr  \\n(0.91 mmol g\\n-1\\n). These values are fairly similar to those of CC3 and show that CC1β \\nmay also show promise in Xe/Kr separation, although in practice, CC3 is \\nsignificantly more stable than CC1β.  \\n \\nSynthesised in accordance with the literature procedure,\\n30\\n the Xe and Kr uptakes for \\na powder sample of CC1β were measured, as for CC3, using a static gravimetric \\nmethod. At 298 K and 1 bar, CC1β was found to adsorb Xe (2.31 mmol g-1,  \\n30 wt %) and Kr (0.82 mmol g\\n-1\\n, 7 wt %) with near identical uptakes to CC3. Again, \\nas expected, the Xe capacity was higher than that of Kr. However, unlike CC3, the \\nXe uptake at 1 bar had not reached saturation (Figure 5.8). Hence, at 1 bar, Xe \\nadsorption has not reached thermodynamic equilibrium and accessed all the potential \\nadsorption sites. This may be due to the difficulty of the large Xe atoms in traversing \\nthe interconnected channels of CC1β, which does not possess the 3-D pore structure \\nof CC3. As MD simulations have not yet been run to study this porous material, it is \\ndifficult to reliably rationalise the behaviour observed here. \\nSeparation of Xenon from Krypton using Porous Organic Cages \\n \\n136 \\n \\n \\nFigure 5.8 Xe and Kr adsorption isotherms for CC1β at 298 K and 1 bar.  \\n5.6 Xe/Kr Breakthrough Measurements using CC1β \\nPerforming dynamic breakthrough measurements for CC1β pellets with pure Xe and \\nKr gas streams demonstrated that it took longer for Xe to break through the \\nadsorption bed compared to Kr, as would be expected (Figure 5.9a). Xe was retained \\nfor around one minute longer, which was shorter than that observed for CC3 (over \\ntwo minutes). The Xe uptake (1.85 mmol g\\n-1\\n) was also lower than the uptake \\nmeasured for the powder sample using the static gravimetric method (2.31 mmol g\\n-1\\n), \\nwhile the Kr uptake calculated from the breakthrough curve was actually higher in \\ncomparison (1.37 mmol g\\n-1 \\nvs. 0.82 mmol g\\n-1\\n). These values indicate that a structural \\nchange may have occurred during the pelletisation process. Running Xe/Kr mixtures \\nof different compositions (Xe/Kr = 80:20, 50:50 and 20:80) showed that the \\nseparation of Xe from Kr was less efficient than for CC3, with Xe breaking through \\nquite soon after Kr (Figures 5.9b-d). It is clear that Xe diffuses through the \\nadsorption bed much more readily than in CC3. The small roll-up in the Kr curve \\nindicates that the outlet Kr concentration only briefly exceeds the inlet concentration \\ndue to less Kr being displaced. This also implies that under the breakthrough \\nconditions, Xe struggles to find appropriate adsorption sites, resulting in more Xe \\natoms simply flowing straight through the adsorption bed without interaction. This \\nSeparation of Xenon from Krypton using Porous Organic Cages \\n \\n137 \\n \\nwould explain the lower Xe uptake and also complements the lack of saturation \\nobserved  in the pure static adsorption isotherm (Figure 5.8). \\n \\nFigure 5.9 (a) Pure Xe and Kr breakthrough curves for CC1β at 298 K and 1 bar. \\nThe flow rate of Xe and Kr is 20 sccm. (b-d) Xe/Kr breakthrough curves for CC1β \\nunder different Xe and Kr compositions: (b) Xe/Kr (80:20); (c) Xe/Kr (50:50), and;  \\n(d) Xe/Kr (20:80). The flow rate of Xe and Kr together is 40 sccm and experiments \\nwere conducted at 298 K and 1 bar. \\nCalculation of the Xe/Kr selectivity revealed that CC1β is not as selective as CC3 \\nfor Xe over Kr at these concentrations. This can be understood by simply analysing \\nthe respective gas uptakes (Table 5.4). For CC3, the Kr uptakes were always lower \\nthan Xe, regardless of the composition used. However, for CC1β this is not the case, \\nwith the Kr uptake exceeding that of Xe when using a Xe/Kr (20:80) mixture. This \\nbehaviour is understandable based on the Kr uptake calculated from the pure \\nbreakthrough curves, which was much higher than expected. A higher Kr uptake \\nresulted in a lower overall Xe/Kr selectivity and this is reflected in the Xe/Kr (20:80) \\nselectivity value for CC1β (2.35), which is nearly half that calculated at the same \\ncomposition for CC3 (5.29).  \\n \\nSeparation of Xenon from Krypton using Porous Organic Cages \\n \\n138 \\n \\nTable 5.4 Xe and Kr uptakes and selectivities for CC1β at 298 K and 1 bar under \\ndifferent Xe and Kr compositions. \\nXe/Kr  \\nFeed Ratio \\nXe Uptake / \\nmmol g\\n-1\\n \\nKr Uptake / \\nmmol g\\n-1 \\nXe/Kr  \\nSelectivity \\n \\n80:20 \\n \\n1.39 \\n \\n0.31 \\n \\n1.17 \\n50:50 1.14 0.73 1.61 \\n20:80 \\n \\n0.71 1.09 2.35 \\n \\nAs for CC3, breakthrough measurements for low concentrations of Xe (400 ppm) \\nand Kr (40 ppm) in simulated air were performed for CC1β. According to the \\nbreakthrough curves (Figure 5.10), N2 and O2 break through the adsorption bed \\nimmediately, followed by CO2 and Kr. These were the same observations made for \\nCC3. However, rather unexpectedly, Xe was not detected until around seven minutes \\nafter the other components and took much longer than in CC3 to reach equilibrium \\nunder the breakthrough conditions. This is peculiar, as based on the binary mixtures \\ntested, the effectiveness of this separation was not expected, especially in comparison \\nto the observations made for CC3. Calculation of the Xe uptake and Xe/Kr \\nselectivity showed that while the adsorption capacity of CC1β (8.4 mmol kg-1) was \\nless than CC3 (11 mmol kg\\n-1\\n), the Xe/Kr selectivity was superior (28.5 vs. 20.4).  \\nA lower Kr uptake for CC1β compared to CC3 (0.03 vs. 0.05 mmol kg-1) makes a \\ncontribution to this increase in selectivity, which is the highest observed from \\nexperimental measurements to date.  \\nUnder these conditions, it is apparent for both CC1β and CC3 that Kr is able to \\ndiffuse quickly through the adsorption bed, with the other components of air ensuring \\na low adsorption capacity. In addition, due to a combination of its low concentration \\nand diffusivity, Xe finds it difficult to pass through the adsorption bed, regardless of \\nthe extent of interconnection and the pore dimensions between the internal cavities of \\nthe cage molecules. For CC1β, it would be extremely beneficial to use MD \\nsimulations to probe the influence of the other air components on the Xe and Kr \\nuptake and selectivity, as well as the effect of the pore structure of CC1β, to \\nrationalise this behaviour. \\nSeparation of Xenon from Krypton using Porous Organic Cages \\n \\n139 \\n \\n \\nFigure 5.10 Xe (400 ppm) and Kr (40 ppm) in simulated air breakthrough curves for \\nCC1β at 298 K and 1 bar.

In the case of CC3, the effective separation of these \\nnoble gases at low concentrations was achieved as a consequence of the dimensions \\nof its 3-D diamondoid pore network, which were a “perfect fit” for the Xe guest.18 \\nThis resulted in the diffusion of the larger, more polarisable Xe being more hindered \\nin comparison to Kr; leading to both a higher Xe uptake and Xe/Kr selectivity in \\ncomparison to the previous-best material Ni/DOBDC. These findings also validate \\ncomplementary MD simulations which initially investigated the flexibility of the \\ncage structures themselves and its impact on the pore size, as well as studying the \\ndiffusion properties of these gases through the pore channels. Despite performing \\npoorly in the separation of Xe from Kr using binary gas mixtures, the Xe/Kr \\nselectivity for CC1β under the same UNF reprocessing conditions actually surpassed \\nCC3. The selectivity of 28.5 is the highest recorded to date and shows that at low \\nconcentrations, Xe finds it difficult to diffuse through the interconnected pore \\nchannels of these POC molecules. \\nSeparation of Xenon from Krypton using Porous Organic Cages \\n \\n140 \\n \\nThese results demonstrate that neither high surface areas, nor the presence of open \\nmetal sites, are key prerequisites for this separation application, with the pore \\ndimensions of the porous material found to be the most important factor. This \\njustifies the conclusions of many simulation studies, where materials containing \\nnarrow pores of uniform width, which are large enough to accommodate a single Xe \\natom, have been shown to be the most applicable for Xe/Kr separation. The synthesis \\nof new materials, or the study of previously-reported ones, needs to keep this feature \\nin mind. However, the design, preparation and isolation of new porous materials with \\nthese desired structures and properties are not trivial. Therefore, the use of simulation \\nstudies to guide towards and identify promising candidates will prove crucial. With \\nrespect to POCs, incorporating silver nanoparticles whilst retaining surface area and \\nappropriate pore dimensions is an attractive option, as they have been shown to \\nenhance Xe adsorption.\\n31\\n Furthermore, investigating the utility of POCs in a two-\\ncolumn breakthrough approach\\n32\\n may also reinforce their applicability to the \\ncommercial separation of these noble gases.   \\n5.8 References \\n1.

Packing in a \\nwindow-to-window and isoreticular fashion to its parent cage CC3, this asymmetric \\ncage possessed a constricted interior cavity and PLE as a result of the incorporated \\nmethyl groups occupying accessible space within the pore structure. Although this \\nresulted in lower gas uptakes, kinetic measurements demonstrated the ability of \\nCC14 to hinder the diffusion of Xe to a greater extent than that observed in CC3, \\nmaking it a potential candidate for the separation of Xe from Kr gas during the \\nreprocessing of UNF.  \\nEnantiomerically-pure derivatives of CHDA were also prepared and successfully \\nreacted with TFB in the preparation of new POC molecules. CC16 was isolated as a \\nphase-pure [4+6] cage, with the introduction of twelve peripheral methyl groups \\nfrustrating the molecular packing, generating additional extrinsic porosity and \\nimproving the gas sorption properties in comparison to CC3, including an apparent \\nBET surface area of 1023 m\\n2\\n g\\n-1\\n. Alternatively, the introduction of twelve peripheral \\nhydroxyl groups made cage formation difficult, with the poor solubility of the \\nresulting cage CC17 making its preparation, purification and crystallisation a \\nchallenge. Adopting a protection-deprotection strategy via the TBDMS-\\nfunctionalised cage CC18, CC17 could be isolated, although the gas sorption \\nproperties of this cage in the amorphous state did not exhibit any selectivity towards \\na particular gas. Utilising a commercially-sourced diamine which possessed bulky \\nethanoanthracene functionality, CC19 was successfully synthesised and \\ncharacterised. Isolated as an [8+12] cage, it is the largest imine bond-based cage \\nprepared to date that is derived from the TFB precursor. However, the inherent \\nflexibility of the bonds resulted in structural collapse upon desolvation. \\nIn a separate investigation, CC1β and CC3 were demonstrated to be suitable \\ncandidates for the capture and separation of Xe and Kr under conditions mimicking \\nthose experienced in the reprocessing of UNF, with the measured Xe uptake and \\nConclusions and Future Outlook \\n \\n144 \\n \\nXe/Kr selectivity for both cages outperforming the previous-best porous material. In \\nthe case of CC3, the unprecedented performance was a direct consequence of the \\ndimensions of its interconnected 3-D diamondoid pore network in relation to the Xe \\nguest, with the findings validating complementary MD simulations.  \\n6.2 Future Outlook \\nDespite the field of POCs still being relatively young, developments have been rapid, \\nwith cages of varying composition, stoichiometry, size and porosity being prepared \\nin the intervening years. With respect to the cages prepared and presented in this \\nthesis, employing derivatives of traditional precursors has been shown to \\nsuccessfully alter the properties in comparison to their parent cage. Although more \\nsterically-demanding TFB derivatives could not be incorporated into the cage \\nstructure, synthetically modifying the diamine precursor was demonstrated to be an \\neffective derivatisation strategy. Introducing other functional groups\\n1-3\\n onto cyclised \\ndiamine precursors will help build on the results presented herein and may lead to \\nmaterials with superior properties. In the case of CC17, a more detailed investigation \\nwould be beneficial in finding a suitable route to its isolation, whether that be \\nthrough elucidating conditions using the original diol diamine, or finding a \\nprotection-deprotection strategy that takes advantage of improved stabilities inferred \\nupon post-synthetic “tying”.4 CC17 is interesting due to the peripheral hydroxyl \\nfunctionalities, which could possibly enable the cage to be reacted with metal salts in \\nthe preparation of cage-MOF materials,\\n5\\n allow chemical attachment to a surface in \\nthe preparation of chiral chromatography columns\\n6\\n or permit other PSM strategies to \\ntune the gas sorption properties.  \\nFuture imine bond-based cages may benefit from a move away from the traditional \\ntrialdehyde-diamine approach, with the majority of precursors now being assessed. \\nFor example, the use of aldehydes based on the structures of certain extended \\ntetratopic MOF linkers may lead to cages of alternate shapes and packing \\narrangements. Other approaches could involve the construction of robust \\narchitectures from carbon-carbon bonds, following the example of Avellaneda et al.\\n7\\n \\nor employing alkyne metathesis, which would allow thermodynamic control of the \\nreaction products.\\n8\\n Alternatively, utilising bonds which have been successfully \\nemployed in the preparation of COFs, including nitroso,\\n9\\n hydrazone\\n10\\n and boroxine\\n11\\n \\nConclusions and Future Outlook \\n \\n145 \\n \\nlinkages, could be implemented in the formation of more structurally or chemically \\nrobust POCs.  \\nWith respect to Xe/Kr separation, future materials prepared specifically for this \\napplication need to adhere to the criteria outlined by Banerjee et al.,\\n12\\n with narrow \\npores of uniform width, which are large enough to accommodate a single Xe atom, \\nbeing a critical prerequisite. Due to the difficulty of predicting how a POC molecule \\nwill self-assemble and subsequently pack in the solid state, synthesising new cages \\nspecifically for this purpose is not trivial. Therefore, the use of simulation studies to \\nguide towards and identify promising candidates, which has been successfully \\nimplemented for MOFs, will prove crucial.  \\n6.3 References \\n1. F.

In this thesis, a range of novel porous organic cages are presented, with each possessing unique functionalities, pore structures and gas sorption properties due to the employment of synthetically-modified versions of traditional trialdehyde and diamine cage precursors. The introduction of new functionality into the cage structure, including methyl, hydroxyl and ethanoanthracene groups, highlights how subtle modification of the cage precursors can initiate significant changes in the self-assembly of the cage molecules. This in turn affects the pore dimensions, as well as the gas sorption and separation performance, of the resultant porous material. This strategy led to the successful isolation of an asymmetric cage molecule, which demonstrated the potential to separate noble gases, as well as the preparation of cages with diverse vertex functionality, molecular size and gas sorption properties. The ability of porous organic cages to selectively separate xenon from krypton gas was also investigated through the use of dynamic breakthrough measurements, with the performance of these cages surpassing all other porous materials evaluated to date.</dc:description><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>http://livrepository.liverpool.ac.uk/2032459/1/ReissPau_July2015_2032459.pdf</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language><dc:subject>QD</dc:subject><dc:title>Porous organic cages: synthesis and application in noble gas separation</dc:title><rioxxterms:author>Reiss, Paul</rioxxterms:author><rioxxterms:type>other</rioxxterms:type><rioxxterms:version>NA</rioxxterms:version></rioxx></metadata></record>',\n",

Evidence presented in this chapter was also used to \\nsubstantiate a patent application (UK Patent Application No. 1411515.8 - “Separation \\nusing solid organic molecular cages”). \\nFrom Chapter 4, the development of CC3 columns and the analysis of their separa-\\ntion behavior contributed directly to a Chemistry of Materials publication.[140] The \\nresearch demonstrated the first instance of applying an organic cage as a gas chroma-\\ntographic stationary phase and, more importantly, that organic cages are capable of \\nperforming separations that are quite difficult to do with conventional stationary \\nphases.  \\n \\n \\nNature Materials allows authors to submit front-cover designs.

Zeolites, which are inorganic microporous materials, are composed of a \\nrepeating pore network of crystalline aluminosilicates (Figure 1-1). Usually, they are \\nhighly crystalline, chemically inert, and, as many occur naturally, they can be \\ncheap.[13] They are widely applied, featuring in technologies such as industrial cata-\\nlysts,[26] water purifiers,[27] and molecular sieves,[13] which demonstrates the general \\nimportance of microporous materials. \\nWhile zeolites have received widespread application, they do have limitations. First, \\ntheir rigid aluminosilicate building blocks only arrange into limited topologies;[28] \\n \\nFigure 1-1\\natoms ind\\nthe petrole\\n \\nconsequen\\ntopologies\\ncroporous\\nspecialist a\\nbrittle[34] w\\nganic mat\\ncan be avo\\nas selectiv\\nplications \\n1.2 Hyb\\nHybrid m\\nMetal-org\\nrepeat uni\\nor 3-dime\\n \\n | Zeolite soc\\nicate silicon. \\num industry \\ntly, zeolites\\n.[32] Second\\n materials,\\npplications\\nhich comp\\nerials, such\\nided, zeolit\\ne adsorben\\nwhich are p\\nrid Micro\\nicroporous\\nanic framew\\nts of organi\\nnsional ne\\nony mobil-5 \\nPatented by t\\nas a catalyst f\\n have diffic\\n, they are\\n so fewer \\n.

Nevertheless, hybrid materials have \\nbeen successfully applied as selective sorbents[40] and chromatographic stationary \\nphases,[46] which makes them a significant source of inspiration for this thesis. \\n1.3 Organic Microporous Materials \\nLike hybrid microporous materials, organic microporous materials have been used in \\nsensing,[47] gas storage,[48] and sorption[49] applications. However, unlike hybrid mate-\\nrials, some organics are solution processable. This solution processability is \\nparticularly interesting because it can be used in conjunction with molecular recogni-\\ntion[50,51] or recrystallisation[52] to tune the materials. Consequently, these kinds of \\nunique properties make organic materials particularly effective in applications where \\ninorganic and hybrid materials are less suitable, such as in separation mem-\\nbranes.[53-55] \\nSome organic microporous materials, such as covalent organic frameworks \\n(COFs),[20] are well-ordered extended frameworks while others, such as organic cage \\ncompounds,[25] are discrete molecules. Because of this diversity, numerous organic \\nmicroporous materials have been identified, too many to comprehensively cover here. \\nInstead, this section focuses on porous organic cages because they feature throughout \\nthis thesis. \\n1.3.1 Porous Organic Cages \\nOrganic cage compounds are discrete, macrocyclic, molecules containing an inner \\nvoid. As summarised by Mastalerz and Zhang,[25] organic cages were reported as early \\nas the 1960s.[56] However, many incremental developments occurred before their \\nsynthesis was sufficiently straightforward and their permanent porosity was meas-\\nured. One of the earliest such measurements was reported by the Cooper group in \\n2009.[57] Since then, a variety of porous organic cages have been synthesised with \\nbehaviours including on-off porosity switching,[52] ternary co-crystal formation,[51] \\nexceptional surface areas,[58] and molecular shape-sorting.[49]  \\nOrganic cages may be formed through reversible or irreversible bond formation. \\nThose formed by the latter tend to be more robust than the former; however, irre-\\nversible syntheses tend to depend on the statistical chance of cage formation, which is \\n6 Introduction \\n \\n \\nusually low.[25] Consequently, there are few high-yielding irreversible synthetic ap-\\nproaches. The highest yielding are summarised by Mastalerz and Zhang.[25] High yield \\nand purity is especially important when synthesising cage compounds for analytical \\nand preparative experiments, such as those featured later in this thesis. Consequently, \\nthis introduction only focuses on cage synthesis via reversible bond formation be-\\ncause these approaches allow a reaction mixture to equilibrate to the \\nthermodynamically preferred cage compound and, hence, tend to be high yielding \\nwith simple syntheses.  \\nGeneral reviews of dynamic covalent chemistry—the study of supramolecular com-\\npound formation via reversible bond formation[59]—report that shape-persistent \\norganic cage compounds can be produced from disulfide formation or phe-\\nnol/aldehyde condensation; however, no significant progress has been made in using \\nthese moieties yet.[60,61] By contrast, several organic cage compounds have been pro-\\nduced via boronic ester formation and imine condensation. \\nThe formation of organic cage compounds by boronic ester formation is particularly \\nnoteworthy because it is already used to produce COF compounds.[20,62] In 2009, \\nSeverin and coworkers reported the synthesis of a [6+3+2] cage compound through \\nthe co-condensation of 4-formylphenylboronic acid, pentaerythritol, and \\ntrisamine.[63] In 2014, Mastalerz and coworkers produced a larger permanently meso-\\nporous organic cage by the reversible formation of 24 boronic ester units.[58] With a \\nwindow width of 4 nm, this is one of the largest organic cages reported. However, \\nwhile this demonstrates that boronic ester formation is capable of producing impres-\\nsive cage structures, these compounds were only recently reported. Consequently, \\ntheir application as selective sorbents or chromatographic stationary phases has not \\nyet been studied— or is discussed further in this thesis—but could be interesting. \\nA more frequently used approach to the formation of organic cages is via the reversi-\\nble formation of imine bonds.[25] The earliest report of this was by Cram and Quan in \\n1991, who synthesised a molecular container (hemicarcerand) from two tetra-\\nformylcavitand molecules and four 1,3-diaminobenzene molecules in a [2+4] \\ncondensation reaction.[64] Subsequently, a variety of cage compounds have been pro-\\nduced using this approach. In particular, the synthesis of cages via a one-pot imine \\ncondensation between an aromatic trialdehyde and an aliphatic diamine is relevant to \\nChapter 2 of this thesis, where this approach is used throughout.  \\nFigure 1-3\\ncondensat\\nronic acid\\nare highlig\\n \\nThe Coop\\nest reporte\\nethylene d\\nCC1, CC2\\nyields rang\\ning the rea\\n2, with an\\npound; fu\\nand proce\\n | Organic ca\\nion of twelve\\n (2) to form c\\nhted in red.

Scheme re-\\nprinted from literature source.[66] \\nPorosity in organic molecules is especially interesting because it is rarely observed: \\nmost molecules pack efficiently in the solid state to form structures with minimal \\nvoid volume.[57] With respect to imine cages, porosity is a consequence of their inter-\\nnal molecular voids and their inefficient packing. Due to the interplay of these two \\ncontributions, slight differences in a cage’s chemical structure can affect its overall \\npore structure (Figure 1-4). For example, due to the window-to window packing of \\nCC3, chirality in its outer cyclohexane groups directly contribute to its overall dia-\\nmondoid pore structure (Figure 1-4). Consequently, homochiral CC3 packs to form a \\nchiral solid,[57] which might enable it to chirally select guests. Investigations into using \\nCC3 to perform chiral separations are presented in Chapters 3 and 4. \\nCC3 also features in Chapters 3 and 4 for two additional reasons. First, gram quanti-\\nties of high-purity homochiral CC3 may be straightforwardly produced in high \\nyields,[50] which reduces reproducibility issues in analytical experiments. Second, \\nwhile homochiral CC3 is soluble in chlorinated solvents, achiral rac-CC3 is poorly \\nsoluble in these solvents; consequently, these differences of solubility may be lever-\\naged to produce monodisperse rac-CC3 nanosuspensions (Figure 1-5).[50]  \\nAs reported by Mastalerz and coworkers, imine cages can also be produced from the \\nimine condensation of aromatic triamines with aromatic dialdehydes (e.g. Figure \\n1-6).[67–69] The use of aromatic amines enables long-range rigidity in the amines to be \\nachieved, which could enable larger imine compounds to be synthesised. Indeed, the \\nvolume of this compound’s internal cavity exceeds CC1-CC3, likely due to the addi-\\ntional rigidity offered by the adamantoid triamine used. Producing further imine \\ncages from aromatic amines could yield interesting cage structures; accordingly, at-\\ntempts to do so are presented in Chapter 2. \\nFigure 1-4\\nCC2 (b), a\\nin isolated\\nisolated vo\\npore chan\\ndiamando\\n \\nFigure 1-5\\nsoluble in\\ncombining\\nfrom litera\\n | Schematic\\nnd CC3-R (c\\n voids (orang\\nids, but the o\\nnels (yellow)\\nid-pore netwo\\n | Exploiting\\n chlorinated \\n solutions o\\nture source.[5\\n of cage-cage\\n).

Two popular approaches tend to be used: substituting \\nparts of known structures, as demonstrated by Snurr and coworkers to generate hy-\\npothetical MOFs,[80] or generating a structures from their constituent atoms, as \\ndemonstrated by the Cooper group to generate hypothetical organic cages.[71] In the \\nlatter approach, models for each precursor were built in [2+3], [4+6], and [8+12] \\nratios with geometries similar to earlier cages discovered by the Cooper group. These \\nmodels were then energy minimised to find the lowest energy conformation. This \\napproach is reported to perform well at reproducing previously reported imine cage \\nstructures and energetics; accordingly, it was incorporated into the cage discovery \\nscreens presented in Chapter 2. However, in-silico approaches tend to generate hypo-\\nthetical compounds faster than conventional experimental approaches can investigate \\nthem, which necessitates the development of complementary HT approaches. \\nStreamlining experimental procedures with HT techniques has received sustained \\ninterest across a variety of fields.[81] As summarised by Kohn and coworkers,[75] the \\nearliest HT approaches tended to focus on producing complex mixtures of com-\\npounds in a single reaction vessel and particularly relied on sophisticated analysis \\nprocedures. An early example of this approach was demonstrated by Menger and \\ncoworkers in 1995,[82] who used it to discover phosphatase catalysts. The approach \\nworked—it generated catalytically active mixtures—but it was difficult to identify the \\nactual component responsible for the catalysis. \\nIn 1998, Schultz and coworkers circumvented these issues when streamlining the \\ndiscovery of photoluminescent mixtures by using a “spatially resolved” approach.[83] \\nIn their approach, different mixtures were printed at specific locations on a surface \\nand an imaging system was used to identify mixtures of interest. These spatially re-\\nsolved approaches have become increasingly popular over the last few decades.[84] At \\nthe time of writing, the use of spatially arranged multi-well reactor arrays is a popular \\napproach for performing syntheses in parallel. Spatial approaches, combined with \\nrobotic platforms, can perform screening reactions at a rate fast enough to investigate \\ntargets generated by in-silico techniques.[85,86] The combination of HT approaches with \\nin-silico techniques is presented throughout Chapter 2. However, accelerated ap-\\nproaches may be bottlenecked by subsequent analysis steps. \\n12 Introduction \\n \\n \\nIdentifying an accompanying analysis approach for HT syntheses can be challenging. \\nOf particular relevance to this project is the measurement of permanent porosity in \\nmicroporous samples. However, the measurement of gas adsorption isotherms using \\nvolumetric adsorption analyzers tends to be slow, only capable of analysing a few \\nsamples in parallel per day. Encouragingly, novel approaches to speed this process up \\nare in development. Kaskel and coworkers reported a new tool, infrasorb-12, which is \\ncapable of analysing twelve samples in parallel in under 5 minutes.[74] These develop-\\nments are relatively recent, so conventional HT analysis approaches are utilised in \\nthis thesis; however, developments like these could aid future HT methodologies. \\nOverall, there has been a range of developments made to circumvent the complexity \\nof microporous materials discovery. Chapter 2 focuses on integrating in-silico, spatial-\\nly resolved, and robotically assisted techniques with an aim to greatly accelerate \\nmicroporous materials discovery. The resulting HT pipeline could be a valuable asset \\nfor finding novel materials to use in a range of applications. \\n1.5 Applications of Microporous Materials  \\nMicroporous materials are well-suited to applications which exploit their molecu-\\nlar-scale pores and high surface areas. They have received attention in hydrogen \\nstorage,[2] carbon dioxide capture,[87] sensing,[88] and catalysis[89] applications. Of par-\\nticular relevance to this thesis is their use in separations, which play a significant role \\nin daily life and industry. Specifically, discussions here are limited to two popular \\nseparation technologies: selective sorbents, for bulk separations, and chromatograph-\\nic stationary phases, for analytical-scale separations. \\n1.5.1 Selective Sorbents \\nWhile distillation accounts for 90-95 % of separations in the chemical industry,[90] it \\nis unfeasible in some scenarios. A popular alternative is ‘adsorptive separation’,[40] \\nwhich is used in familiar technologies such as water purifiers[27] and gas filters.[91] In \\nadsorptive separation, a mixture is separated by selectively adsorbing its components \\ninto a microporous material (Figure 1-7). Relevant to this thesis is the use of organic \\ncages to perform adsorptive separations. Cages have already been used to separate \\nhydrocarbon[49,92] or carbohydrate[93] mixtures; however, fewer investigations are \\navailable than for materials such as MOFs or zeolites. Consequently, the numerous \\nreports of separations by these materials also provide a useful insight into the separa-\\ntion behaviour of microporous materials. \\nApplications of Microporous Materials 13 \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nFigure 1-7 | Schematic of the adsorptive separation process. A mixture is exposed to a mi-\\ncroporous material (a), which selectively adsorbs certain components of the mixture (b). \\nComponents which remain in the solution or gas phase can then be collected (c) and adsorbed \\ncomponents are subsequently desorbed for collection (d). \\n \\nC8 alkylaromatic isomeric compounds containing o-xylene (oX), m-xylene (mX), \\np-xylene (pX), and ethylbenzene (EB) are important industrial feedstock chemicals \\nwhich tend to be produced as a mixture of all four components.[40] These can be chal-\\nlenging to separate by distillation because of their similar boiling points, particularly \\nin the case of separating pX from mX and EB, which have boiling points of 138, 139, \\nand 136 °C respectively. Consequently, fractional crystallisation methods are used to \\nseparate these compounds in industry[94] but adsorptive separation methods have also \\nreceived much attention because they could simplify the process. Accordingly, the use \\nof a range of microporous materials,[95] including MOFs,[96] zeolites,[95] and organic \\ncages[49]  to separate C8 alkylaromatics has been reported. \\nInitial experimental investigations in using MOFs for C8 alkylaromatic separations \\nwere reported by Denayer and coworkers in 2008.[97] Breakthrough measurements of \\nbinary mixtures with MIL-47 indicated that two of the four isomers could be separat-\\ned with pX/oX isolated as a mixture. It was also found that adsorption selectivity \\nincreased with an increasing degree of pore filling, indicating that selectivity is pres-\\nsure dependent. Thus the efficient separation of these components is thought to be \\ndue their different packing modes within the pores of MIL-47. A follow-up study by \\nthe same group investigated MIL-53, a flexible MOF, and found no adsorption prefer-\\nence between oX and EB below the “pore-opening” pressure.[98] Above it, however, \\nselectivity increased with increasing pressure (Figure 1-8). This is believed to be a \\nresult of different packing modes of the adsorbed molecules in its pores.  \\na b c d\\n14 In\\n \\n \\nWhile s\\ndue to d\\non diffe\\ncowork\\nMOF-5 \\nlatter to\\nsection \\n(5.85-6.\\n5.

X-ray diffraction measurements indicated that meta-\\nsubstituted components reside within the cage’s cavity while para-substituted compo-\\nnents reside in inter-cage cavities. As there are twice as many inter-cage cavities, the \\noverall structure of CC3 is able to accommodate more para-substituted compounds.  \\nAlso, as with MIL-53,[98] flexibility within the structure of CC3 appears to play a role. \\npara-Substituted compounds are larger than the narrowest point in the channels (5.32 \\nÅ); however, flexibility within the structure allows the cage to accommodate larger \\ncomponents. The role of flexibility is particularly relevant to investigations of shape \\nselectivity by CC3, which are presented in Chapters 3 and 4, as its flexibility might \\nenable it to perform a variety of shape-selective separations. \\nThe separation of racemic mixtures is also an important industrial and analytical \\nprocess. Their separation has become increasingly important in the pharmaceutical \\nfield due to the appreciation that two enantiomers of a drug often have different activ-\\nities in the human body. Indeed, in 2004 five of the top ten selling drugs—61 % of the \\nglobal sales of pharmaceuticals—were single enantiomer products.[100] However, be-\\ncause enantiomers are chemically identical, the separation of racemates can be \\nparticularly challenging. \\nUsually, if asymmetric syntheses are unavailable, two main strategies have evolved for \\nthe separation of chiral compounds: an indirect method, which involves the for-\\nmation of diastereomers by reacting compounds with a chiral derivatising agent \\n(CDA); and the direct method, based on the reversible formation of diastereomers \\nwith an achiral compound.[101] Because a broad variety of CDAs are available, the \\nformer is commonly used in industry. However, indirect approaches introduce addi-\\ntional steps into the synthetic procedure, which can be costly. Further, CDAs are not \\navailable for all molecules. \\nIn direct approaches, chiral hosts preferentially bind to an enantiomer of a racemate, \\na process referred to as enantioselective molecular recognition.[102] The forces involved \\nare non-covalent intermolecular interactions such as dipole-dipole, induced dipole, \\nhydrogen bonding, van der Waals, or π-stacking interactions. The earliest chiral hosts \\nwere natural materials such as wool, paper, or cellulose;[102] however, some racemates \\ncan be particularly difficult to separate with these materials, which necessitates \\nstronger differentiators. As guest to pore-wall interactions are strong in microporous \\nmaterials, they are capable of strongly differentiating guests.

Likewise, the same group also recently re-\\nported the synthesis of ITQ-37, a mesoporous chiral zeolite,[105] but, as with SU-15 and \\nSU-32, no enantioselectivity measurements have yet been reported for this material.  \\nOverall, microporous materials appear to perform well as selective adsorbents for a \\nwide variety of mixtures. However, there are relatively few studies into the use of \\norganic cages as selective adsorbents; specifically, their use as enantioselective \\nsorbents has not been studied at all. Consequently, this topic is the focal point of \\nChapter 3, wherein the first instance of enantioselective molecular recognition by \\nCC3-R, a homochiral organic cage, is presented. \\n1.5.2 As Chromatographic Stationary Phases \\nIn chromatography, the separation of compounds depends on their differing affinities \\ntowards a stationary phase (simplified schematic in Section 6.1). In that respect, sta-\\ntionary phases share similarities with selective adsorbents. However, because \\ncomponents continually exchange on and off the stationary phase, particular empha-\\nsis is directed towards the reversibility and speed of adsorption.  \\nChromatography is a broad field which spans a variety of techniques. While tech-\\nniques such as high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) are extremely \\npopular, this thesis focuses on producing stationary phases for gas chromatography \\n(GC). One reason is that GC is a highly efficient separation technique for separating \\nvolatile compounds which are more likely to have molecular sizes small enough to \\nenter micropores. Another is that GC tends to use either hydrogen or helium as mo-\\nbile phases, which are unlikely to solvate or recrystallise the stationary phase. Likely \\nbecause of these considerations, studies of microporous stationary phases for other \\nchromatographic techniques are reported to lag behind studies of their use in GC,[46] \\nalthough some are available.[110,111] \\n18 Introduction \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nOf particular relevance to this thesis are chiral stationary phases (CSPs) for GC, \\nwhich separate enantiomers by favourable diastereomer-forming mechanisms such as \\nhydrogen bonding, metal coordination, or inclusion.[112] These types of separation can \\nbe particularly valuable, yet challenging, to perform. Accordingly, the development of \\nCSPs, such as cyclodextrins (CDs), has received much attention.[113,114] \\nCDs are inexpensive chiral cyclic sugar molecules produced from starch (Figure \\n1-10).[113] They contain three inequivalent –OH groups that may be selectively derivat-\\nised.[115] Methylated CDs are commonly applied as CSPs because they may be \\ndissolved into liquid polymers and coated as liquid films in capillary columns.[116] \\nBecause of their relatively low cost and high efficiency, CD derivatives are the most \\ncommon commercially-available CSPs.[117] \\nBecause CDs contain an inner void, there is scope for them to separate compounds \\nby their molecular size and shape. As discussed for selective sorbents, this can be a \\nparticularly useful method of differentiating chemically similar compounds, such as \\nalkylaromatics. Indeed, early on in the adaption of CDs, Smolková-Keulemansová \\nand coworkers identified CDs’ ability to shape-separate xylene, diethylbenzene, and \\ntrimethylbenzene isomers by shape-selective inclusion compound formation (Figure \\n1-11).[118] The same researchers further investigated this effect for a wide variety of \\nalkylaromatics and identified that, when compared with para and meta isomers, ortho \\nisomers are sterically restricted from entering the CD’s inner-ring, which results in \\nweaker surface interactions and, consequently, lower retention times.[119] \\nWhile CDs are a popular stationary phase, their bowl-shaped inner-cavities might \\nlimit the scope of shapes they may differentiate. Consequently, researchers have in-\\nvestigated materials with alternative pore shapes, such as MOFs, as stationary phases \\nfor molecular shape[120] or chiral[121] separations. One of the earliest investigations into \\nusing MOFs as CSPs was reported by Fedin and coworkers in 2007.[122] In their ap-\\nproach, a chiral MOF was packed into a column to separate sulfoxide compounds by \\nHPLC; however, the reported chromatograms contain quite broad peaks (Figure \\n1-12).  \\nFigure 1-1\\ncomplexat\\nanalytical \\nprimary fa\\n \\nFigure 1-1\\ners.

This approach is used in other reported \\ncoatings of MOFs;[124–126] however, it can is difficult to get an even coating with this \\napproach,[117] which is discussed in more detail in Chapter 4. \\nRacemates separated by chiral MOFs tend to contain a hydrogen-bonding moiety \\nwhich can act as a strong differentiator between enantiomers. By contrast, the separa-\\ntion of alkylaromatics, which contain no strong dipoles, can be difficult since \\ncomparatively weaker π-π and van der Waals surface interactions are the only handle \\nfor their differentiation.[102] Further, the separation of alkane isomers, where no π-π \\ninteractions are available, can be especially challenging. However, as explained in \\nSection 1.5.1, the separation of alkylaromatics and alkane isomers are significant in-\\ndustrial processes. Accordingly, the separation of these compounds on MOF-coated \\nGC capillary columns has received some attention. \\nYan and coworkers were the earliest to report using a MOF, MIL-101, for the high \\nresolution-separation of xylene isomers by GC.[124] In their approach, capillaries were \\ncoated with MIL-101 via the dynamic coating method and found to achieve baseline \\nseparation of p-xylene, o-xylene, m-xylene, and ethylbenzene. They noted that the \\nseparation efficiency of their coated capillary column exceeded efficiencies of packed \\ncolumns. As the pore diameters of MIL-101 (1.4 and 1.6 nm) are much larger than the \\nanalytes (0.58-0.68 nm), the source of separation behaviour is not due to differences \\nin diffusion speed. The explanation provided is that MIL-101’s polarity and coordina-\\ntively unsaturated sites are responsible for the separation behaviour, which indicates \\nthat the separation of xylene isomers does not necessarily require a shape-restricting \\npore structure in the host. \\n \\nFigure 1-1\\ncapillary c\\nsented: iso\\nphenyl-su\\nderivative\\nCSPs, sepa\\nform sepa\\nwhen com\\n \\n3 | GC chrom\\nolumn, as re\\nleucine deriv\\nccinic acid (e\\n (i); caphor (j\\nration quality\\nrations, which\\npared to LC t\\natograms of\\nported by Yu\\native (a); citro\\n); 1-phenyl-eth\\n); and 2-meth\\n was much im\\n could, in par\\nechniques.[117]\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n chiral separ\\nan and cowo\\nnellal (b); 1-p\\nanol (f); vali\\nyl-1-butanol \\nproved with\\nt, be due to t\\n Figure reprin\\nAppli\\nations on a [\\nrkers.

In some \\ncases, these can be rationalised. Indeed, in Chapters 3 and 4, it is presented that the \\nseparation behaviour of a previously studied cage, CC3, may rationalised using com-\\nputational models. Predicting the behaviour of an unknown, hypothetical, material is \\nmuch more difficult and, in many cases, may only be achieved with the assistance of \\nexperimentation and analysis. \\nThis chapter presents two changes to conventional synthetic workflows. First, in-silico \\napproaches were used to produce synthetic targets. Second, automated robotic plat-\\nforms were used to accelerate practical synthetic procedures. The resulting workflow \\nwas used to discover a novel organic cage compound. \\n2.1 Challenges of Organic Cage Discovery \\nMultiple routes for synthesising organic cages are available (Section 1.3.1). This Chap-\\nter focuses on the one-pot imine condensation of trialdehydes with diamines. Imine \\ncages produced in this manner are well-studied, especially by the Cooper group, \\nwhich has investigated their in-silico assembly,[71] derivatization,[70] crystallography,[52] \\nand morphology.[50] However, establishing which precursors and reaction conditions \\nwill produce a shape-persistent imine cage can be especially challenging. \\nFirst, as discussed in Section 1.4, imine cages have a series of non-intuitive and com-\\nplex structure-property relationships which makes predicting their properties \\nchallenging. The stoichiometry of imine condensations of trialdehydes with diamines \\ncan, in principle, produce n[2+3] (e.g. [2+3], [4+6], [8+12], …) organic cage com-\\npounds.[57,71] The Cooper group reported that in-silico design techniques can be used \\nto help predict the thermodynamically preferred cage product from a complex mix-\\nture.[71] Following a similar procedure, many experimental screens presented in this \\nChapter were directed by analysing the structure of hypothetical products from com-\\nputational methods, which is likely to be an improvement over qualitative guesses of \\nthe structure. However, while these approaches can be used to hypothesise the struc-\\nture of a cage product, they are unable to account for the impact of synthetic \\nconditions. \\nSecond, a complex mixture of intermediates is produced by one-pot imine condensa-\\ntions. If the reaction conditions are not suitable, these components may react \\nirreversibly to form imine polymer byproducts. Consequently,  the concentrations, \\nSynthesising Organic Cages Using Automated Platforms 27 \\n  \\n \\n \\naddition-rates, and temperatures of cage syntheses need to be carefully controlled.[65] \\nCarefully tuning these conditions is a time-consuming trial-and-error process that \\ncan be accelerated by approaches that increase practical throughput, such as HT \\nautomated platforms. However, these platforms perform procedures differently from \\nconventional methods, necessitating some initial development. \\n2.2 Synthesising Organic Cages Using Automated Platforms \\nThe Chemspeed Synthesizer SLT platform was used in synthetic screens. While the \\nspecifics of its use can be quite involved, it was simply used as an automated means of \\nperforming standard synthetic tasks – liquids may be transferred using an attached \\nsyringe pump, reaction vessels may be stirred using a base vortexer, and so on. How-\\never, some tasks, such as the transfer of liquids, were much easier to perform than \\nothers. Accordingly, synthetic methods were found to perform optimally when ex-\\nploiting these strengths.  \\nImine cages have previously been synthesised by layering approaches.[50,57] These \\napproaches involve placing solid trialdehyde within a reaction vessel followed by \\ngently pipetting solvent, catalyst, and diamine solutions on top, which forms discrete \\nlayers. The vessel is left unstirred and the slow diffusion of precursors causes the reac-\\ntion to proceed slowly. The layering approach tends to be the preferred because \\nminimal solvent is used and, for some preparations, it directly produces high quality \\ncrystals. However, layering was found to be quite difficult to perform with robotic \\nplatforms for several reasons: solid-dispensing apparatus tended to produce uneven \\nsolid layers; slowly layering solutions required extremely low syringe-pump speeds, \\nwhich tended to promote solvent evaporation within the liquid handling system; and \\nthe robotic arm on the platforms tended to move rapidly, disturbing the layers.  \\nAs an alternative to layering approaches, the Cooper group reported that the one-pot \\nimine condensation of CC1 may be performed entirely in solution using \\nhigh-dilution slow-addition approaches.[65] This involves slowly adding dilute trialde-\\nhyde solutions to dilute stirred and cooled solutions of diamine, stirring the solution \\nfor 24 h to maximise product formation, and then isolating the final product by rota-\\nry evaporation. This approach should be much better suited to robotic platforms, \\nmore easily scaled up, and allow fine control over parameters such as reactant con-\\ncentration, stirring rate, temperature and addition rate. Encouragingly, a trial \\nexperiment indicated that the approach translated well to automated platforms \\n28 Discovering Novel Organic Cages \\n \\n \\n(Figure 2-1). In that case, the synthesis of CC1 with high-dilution slow-addition tech-\\nniques had been investigated previously; however, the additional observation that \\nCC3 may also be synthesised in this manner reinforced the viability of the approach, \\nwhich prompted its use with yet-untested precursors. \\n2.3 High-Throughput (HT) Imine Cage Discovery \\nUsing parallel HT approaches, experimental parameters known to affect yield, such as \\nreactant concentration,[65] could be varied in tandem. For example, a reaction could \\nbe performed at low concentration both with and without catalyst, rather than vary-\\ning one parameter while fixing the rest. In principle, this is an optimal approach for \\nelucidating ideal cage-forming conditions, especially for yet-untested chemistries. \\nWhile extended trialdehydes may be developed to enable the formation of larger cage \\ncompounds, diamine extension may also be used to increase the cage’s size. In larger \\ntrialdehydes, extended aromatic linkages allow rigidity to be maintained.[128] By con-\\ntrast, rigidity in the diamine is achieved through short—usually, two carbon—chains \\nbetween the amine moieties. Extending this chain results in a loss of rigidity and, \\nconsequently, organic cages made from longer aliphatic diamines tend to collapse \\nupon desolvation.[71] \\nOne approach for introducing rigidity is to use an aromatic amine (aniline). The use \\nof anilines to produce shape-persistent imine cages has been reported by Mastalerz \\nand coworkers,[67,68,129,130] who have, for example, produced a cage from the reaction of \\na four tri-aniline molecules with six dialdehyde molecules (see introduction, Figure \\n1-6). In similar approaches, we used screening methods to investigate if organic cages \\ncould be produced by reacting benzene-1,3,5-tricarbaldehyde (Figure 2-2, A) with \\n4,4′-diaminodiphenylmethane (B).  \\nLike aliphatic diamines, dianilines may undergo imine condensation with aldehydes. \\nHowever, their nucleophilicity is likely to differ from aliphatic diamines due to conju-\\ngation effects. Indeed, the pKb of B is calculated to be 8.68, indicating that it is likely \\nto be significantly less nucleophilic than, for example, ethylene diamine, which has a \\npKb of 4.11.* With that consideration, a broad screen in which a range of tempera-\\ntures, concentrations, and catalysts were varied was conducted (Figure 2-2).  \\n                                                      \\n* pKb values calculated using ACD/Labs V11.02 \\nHigh-Throughput (HT) Imine Cage Discovery 29 \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n10 -0.5\\nManual\\nAutomated\\n\\uf064 (ppm)\\nCH2Cl2\\n(solvent surpressed)\\n \\n10 -0.5\\nManual\\nAutomated\\nCH2Cl2\\n(solvent surpressed)\\n\\uf064 (ppm)  \\n \\nFigure 2-1 | 1H NMR (CDCl3) spectra of CC1 (top) and CC3 (bottom) produced by manual and \\nrobotically-automated methods.

The reaction \\nof benzene-1,3,5-tricarbaldehyde (A) with 4,4’-methylenedianiline (B) was performed with differ-\\nent solvents, temperatures, and concentrations with and without trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) \\ncatalyst. However, imines formed from anilines have a lower degree of reversibility. As a result, \\nsyntheses tended to produce polymer suspensions. \\n \\nFor most products of the screen, FTIR measurements indicated the formation of an \\nimine moiety around 1625 cm-1. However, most samples were observed to contain \\ninsoluble precipitates. These were likely to be imine polymer byproducts. This is fur-\\nther reinforced by 1H NMR analyses which only measured negligible concentrations \\nof imine environments and starting materials remaining in the solution phase. \\nThe formation of polymer in preference to a cage product is likely to be due to the \\ndifferences in the reversibility of imine formation between anilines and aliphatic \\ndiamines. High-yielding organic cage syntheses rely on reversibility to equilibrate \\nintermediates into the final product, a dynamic covalent chemistry[59] process that \\neventually results in the thermodynamically preferred product. Imine formation from \\nanilines is likely to be less reversible;[131] consequently, because intermediates are less-\\nable to reverse from (unfavourable) oligomer formation, precipitation occurred. If \\nthis is the case, cage formation from anilines is more likely to rely on statistical \\nchance in the absence of any directing effects.  \\n In order t\\nlised.

However, it was especially challenging to model the affect that synthetic \\nconditions have on cage compound formation.[71] With that in mind, a small set of \\nreactions were conducted to measure the effect of precursor concentration and acidic \\ncatalyst. Specifically, the reaction of an extended trialdehyde linker, tris([1,1’-\\nbiphenyl]-4-carbaldehyde) (Figure 2-4, C), with either ethylene diamine (D); (1R, \\n2R)-1,2-diaminocyclohexane (E); or 1,2-diaminopropane (F) was investigated. Models \\nindicated that the resulting [4+6] cage compounds should not contain strained bonds \\nor clashing moieties. Additionally, because of the rigidity of the trialdehyde, their \\ncentral voids were predicted to be shape persistent (e.g. Figure 2-3c). \\nIn the screen, the concentrations of both the diamine and trialdehyde stocks were \\nvaried between 2, 10, and 20 mmol L-1. These concentrations are close to precursor \\nconcentrations used in CC1 syntheses.[65] Additionally, the reaction was conducted \\nwith or without trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) catalyst, which is used in other imine cage \\nsyntheses.[50,57] Lower concentration samples were observed to be clear solutions \\nwhich, according to 1H NMR and FTIR measurements, contained imine environ-\\nments. However, attempts to isolate a cage product from these solutions were \\nunsuccessful.  \\nGPC analyses indicated the presence of large cage-sized compounds in some mix-\\ntures (e.g. Figure 2-4, bottom). However, a variety of other components were also \\npresent in these solutions, which thwarted recrystallisation. This particular system \\nprobably produced mixtures because of the trialdehyde’s long biphenyl struts. Be-\\ncause of them, the resulting cage’s windows are likely to be large compared to the \\ncage’s overall size, which could promote interpenetration.[132] This phenomenon has \\nbeen observed for previously reported imine cages.[133] Additionally, the biphenyl \\nmoiety is more flexible than the struts of other trialdehyde precursors, which may \\nenable it to form a mixture of [2+3], [4+6], and [8+12] cages rather than being geo-\\nmetrically constricted to a single stoichiometry. \\n \\n \\nHigh-Throughput (HT) Imine Cage Discovery 33 \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n0\\n30\\n11 -0.5\\n0\\n30\\n20 mmol L-1\\n2 mmol L-1\\nI\\n \\n\\uf064 (ppm)  \\n \\n \\n \\n0 30\\nA\\nt (min)\\nA + E (CC3)\\n \\n0 30\\nC + E\\nt (min)\\nC\\n \\n \\nFigure 2-4 | Investigating the effect of reaction conditions on organic cage syntheses.

The synthesis of CC3 from its precursor; 1,3,5-\\ntriformylbenzene (A); is shown on the left side. A product from the screening procedure is shown \\non the right side. Comparing the two, it is apparent that screening products produced a broad \\nrange of compounds with a larger, possibly cage, compound eluting quickly. See experimental \\nSection 7.1.3.4 (p100) for further details.  \\n34 Discovering Novel Organic Cages \\n \\n \\nFor known cage syntheses, a reduction in yield can be directly attributed to imine \\npolymer formation. Varying precursor stock concentrations did appear to eliminate \\nthe formation of imine polymer; however, the reaction did not produce a single \\nproduct. Based on these observations, it was hypothesised that only certain precursor \\ncombinations may produce single cage products and others, even after optimising \\nsynthetic conditions, form mixtures. To investigate this, a screening approach was \\ndeveloped to broadly screen a wider variety of precursor combinations in parallel.  \\nIn the screen, the factorial combination of four aldehydes with four diamines, both \\ncatalysed and uncatalysed by TFA, was attempted (Figure 2-5). This approach ap-\\npeared to be effective at identifying systems which merit further investigation. In \\nmost samples, infrared absorption around 1680 cm-1 confirmed the formation of an \\nimine bond. Most combinations produced insoluble imine products (e.g.  \\n \\n \\n \\nFigure 2-5 | Broadened screening approach.

Evaporation from a range of pure \\nsolvents and controlled thermal cycling techniques did not yield single crystals.  \\nHowever, using the vial-in-vial vapour diffusion technique, a screen of 42 sol-\\nvent/antisolvent combinations identified two combinations that produced crystalline \\nsolids: 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol / methanol (TFE / MeOH); and dimethylacetamide / \\nmethanol (DMAC / MeOH). Unfortunately, TFE / MeOH crystals were observed to \\nbe twinned, making their resulting diffraction patterns difficult to refine. By contrast, \\nDMAC / MeOH crystals did not have this issue. Single crystal XRD (scXRD) analysis \\nof those crystals indicated that the solvated CCX-S molecules crystallised in the trig-\\nonal space group P3, a = 30.1537(9), c = 10.9405(3) Å, V = 8614.9(4) Å3, Z = 3, \\uf072 = \\n1.103 g·cm-3 (Figure 2-7).  \\nAnalysis of this crystal structure indicated that the internal void of CCX-S is similar \\nto previously reported compounds. It has triangular window shape with a diameter of \\n5.7 Å (Figure 2-7). Similarly-shaped windows with diameters of 5.8, 6.1, and 5.8 Å \\nhave been measured for CC1, CC2, and CC3 respectively.[57] However, the windows of \\nCCX-S may be inflated by the presence of solvent guests. Indeed, variable-\\ntemperature scXRD measurements indicated a phase change in CCX-S to a hexago-\\nnal space group P (a = 30.57, c = 11.06 Å), which might be due to its collapse upon \\nsolvent evaporation. This hypothesis was reinforced by analysis of refined computa-\\ntional models, which indicated that CCX-S’s internal cavity is deflated in the absence \\nof solvent molecules (Figure 2-8). Unfortunately, the lower quality of diffraction data \\nat elevated temperatures prevented experimental refinement of this desolvated struc-\\nture.  \\nWhile flexible exo-functional benzyl moieties are unique to CCX-S, they appear to \\nnegatively impact its solid-state properties. scXRD measurements indicated greater \\ndisorder in the exo benzyls. This is likely to frustrate ordered packing of the cage \\nmolecules, which explains why CCX-S was difficult to crystallise. Additionally, the \\nouter moieties are, in principle, small enough to interpenetrate nearby CCX-S mole-\\ncules, which could explain the observation that amorphous CCX-S was nonporous to \\nN2. There is still a possibility that desolvated crystalline CCX-S is porous; however, \\nbulk crystallisation experiments tended to produce low quality semi-crystalline sol-\\nids. \\nFigure 2-\\nalong the \\nrepresenta\\nmoved for\\nBottom-r\\ntion, view\\n \\n \\n7 | scXRD st\\nc-axis.

Initially, techniques such as slow layering were directly reproduced but \\nfound to be difficult to perform on automated platforms. Accordingly, processes were \\ndeveloped to use high dilution, slow addition, methods which were previously \\ndemonstrated for the synthesis of CC1.[65] Utilising this method, CC1 and CC3 were \\nsuccessfully synthesised on the automated platforms (Figure 2-1, p29), proving its \\nviability for use in subsequent screening experiments. \\nThe synthesis of an organic cage compound was attempted by reacting an aliphatic \\ntrialdehyde; benzene-1,3,5-tricarbaldehyde (A, Figure 2-2, p30); with an aromatic \\ndiamine, 4,4’-methylenedianiline (B). Using the platforms, a broad screen was con-\\nducted to investigate a range of synthetic conditions. However, only poly-imine \\nproducts were isolated, which is likely due to the lower nucleophilicity of aromatic \\ndiamines when compared with aliphatic diamines. \\nIn order to maximise the efficacy of subsequent screens, models of possible cage \\nproducts were built in-silico using a reported method (Figure 2-3, p31).[135] These were \\nvaluable endpoints; however, it was particularly challenging to model the effect of \\nreaction conditions in-silico. Accordingly, a subsequent screen was developed to ex-\\nplore the effect of reaction conditions. The reaction of tris([1,1’-biphenyl]-4-\\ncarbaldehyde) with either ethylene diamine (D); (1R, 2R)-1,2-diaminocyclohexane \\n(E); or 1,2-diaminopropane (F) was investigated (Figure 2-4, p33). In-silico models \\ncalculated the structure of a possible cage product (Figure 2-3c). This structure ap-\\npeared to contain no strained bonds or clashing moieties. Encouragingly, 1H NMR \\nand FTIR analyses indicated soluble imine environments in some of the products. In \\nparticular, products synthesised from (1R, 2R)-1,2-diaminocyclohexane were ob-\\nserved to produce a large, soluble, imine-containing, compound. However, GPC \\nanalyses indicated that complex mixtures tended to be produced from these reac-\\ntions, which thwarted isolation attempts.  \\nBased on these observations, it was hypothesised that certain reactant combinations \\nwere likely to produce complex mixtures regardless of synthetic conditions. With that \\nin mind, a combinatorial screen of many different trialdehyde-diamine combinations \\nwas performed (Figure 2-5, p34). Sixteen synthetic pairs were investigated. Products \\nfrom the majority of pairs were observed to be complex mixtures. However, the reac-\\n40 Discovering Novel Organic Cages \\n \\n \\ntion of benzene-1,3,5-tricarbaldehyde (A) with (3S, 4S)-3,4-diamino-1-\\nbenzopyrollidine (I) produced single-component solutions of a previously unreport-\\ned organic cage compound, CCX-S. Subsequent experiments focused on the scale up \\nand characterization of this product.  \\nThe reaction was scaled up to produce 886 mg of CCX-S with a yield of 96 %. Single \\ncrystals of the cage were obtained from the vial-in-vial vapour diffusion of methanol \\nvapour into a solution of CCX-S dissolved in DMAC. scXRD of these crystals con-\\nfirmed the organic cage structure of CCX-S (Figure 2-7). Structural analysis of CCX-\\nS indicates it has a similar window shape and diameter to CC1, CC2, and CC3; how-\\never, unlike these cages, computational models and variable temperature scXRD \\nindicate that the pore structure of CCX-S is likely to collapse upon desolvation. Fur-\\nther, it is likely that CCX-S’s extrinsic benzyl moieties will interpenetrate—or at least \\nblock—adjacent neighbours, reducing its overall solid-state porosity. This is likely \\nwhy amorphous CCX-S was measured to be nonporous to N2. \\nOverall, attempts have been made to speed up traditional synthetic procedures by \\nusing automated platforms and computational modelling. While a novel material was \\ndiscovered in this manner, it is clear that both the practical and computational proce-\\ndures require further development. Regardless, the work in this Chapter shows that \\nthe combination of HT procedures with computational models could be a viable \\nstrategy for discovering new organic cages.  \\n \\n  \\n  \\n \\n Or3\\nSo\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\ngani\\nrben\\nc Ca\\nts \\nges as Selective \\n \\n \\n42 Organic Cages as Selective Sorbents \\n \\n \\nTechnologies such as selective sorbents and chromatographic stationary phases rely \\non a porous material’s ability to discriminate between compounds. This discrimina-\\ntion usually occurs due to a complex combination of interactions[40,102] which, if \\ncomprehensively understood, can help predict which mixtures the material can sepa-\\nrate.[136] While organic cages have received attention for their ability to discriminate \\nrare gases,[66] alkylaromatics,[25] alkali metal ions,[137] and carbohydrates,[93]  there are \\nstill some systems, such as chiral compounds, which have not received attention. \\nTheir separation could be particularly valuable; however, measuring and understand-\\ning complex selectivity effects remains challenging. \\nThis Chapter focuses on identifying and understanding the host-guest interactions \\nresponsible for selective adsorption in CC3. Three steps towards this goal are dis-\\ncussed: (i) the development of a straightforward measurement technique for \\nidentifying mixtures that CC3 selectively adsorbs, (ii) further improving the tech-\\nnique’s reproducibility, which enabled quantitative measurements of host-guest \\nbehaviour, and; (iii) using the fully developed technique to establish molecular and \\nthermodynamic explanations of CC3’s host-guest behaviour. \\nResults presented in Section 0 of this Chapter contributed directly to a Nature Mate-\\nrials publication: “Separation of rare gases and chiral molecules by selective binding \\nin porous organic cages”.[66]  \\n3.1 Screening for Selective Sorption Behaviour \\nA common method for measuring selectivity is ‘adsorptive separation’.[40] In it, a host \\nis soaked in a liquid guest mixture, the guest-adsorbed host is then isolated by filtra-\\ntion, washed to remove adsorbed guests, and the washings, which contain the \\ndesorbed guest, are analysed. One concern with this approach was that CC3-R, which \\nis reported to be soluble in organic solvents such as dichloromethane,[57] may dissolve \\nor recrystallise in concentrated guests. Recrystallisation is especially concerning be-\\ncause it is likely to frustrate analysis attempts; indeed, studies indicate that \\npolymorphs of organic cages can have differing surface areas and pore topologies.[52] \\nTo avoid recrystallisation, an alternative technique that minimised the amount of \\nguest used was developed (Figure 3-1). Small volumes of guest mixtures were added \\nto a vessel containing CC3-R, the vessel was sealed, agitated, and its headspace was \\nanalysed by gas chromatography (GC). The technique was used to screen a variety of  \\n \\nScreening for Selective Sorption Behaviour 43 \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nFigure 3-1 | Qualitatively measuring selective adsorption phenomena. Control and experi-\\nmental samples were run in parallel. In experimental samples, hosts were added (1) and activated \\n(2). A small quantity of guest mixture was added (3) and gently mixed (4) to allow it to exchange \\ninto the host; finally, the headspace concentration of the guest was measured (5). In control sam-\\nples, the headspace concentration of a component is related to the amount added.[117,138] By \\ncontrast, in experimental samples, adsorbed components were unable to exchange with the head-\\nspace. Therefore, differences in measured headspace concentrations between control and \\nexperimental samples indicated selective adsorption by the host (6). \\nmixtures (see Appendix, p137). Most mixtures were binary but many-component \\nmixtures were also analysed using this approach (see Appendix, p136). \\nAs discussed in Section 1.5.1, the separation of xylene isomers is particularly im-\\nportant. The Cooper group investigated previously the separation of xylene isomers \\nwith CC3-R,[49] which demonstrated that the cage preferentially adsorbs C8 aromatics \\nin the order para-, meta-, and then ortho-xylene due to shape sorting effects. Specifi-\\ncally, the narrower steric envelope of the para isomer promoted its adsorption into \\nCC3-R when compared with the other isomers. Encouragingly, measurements per-\\nformed using the newly developed technique corroborated that study: upon exposing \\na xylene isomer mixture to CC3-R, the resulting GC peak areas diminished following \\nthe same pattern: para- > meta- >> ortho-xylene (Figure 3-2).  \\nThis proved the viability of the technique and prompted measurements on unstudied \\nguest mixtures. Of particular interest was the separation of racemates which, as dis-\\ncussed in Section 1.5.1, can be particularly valuable, especially in the pharmaceutical \\nindustry.[100] This class of separations rely on a combination of interactions between a \\nhomochiral host and guest.[102,112] CC3-R is reported to form a chiral pore network,[57] \\nwhich should enable it to perform chiral separations. However, chiral selectivity may \\n \\nControl\\nSample\\nStep # 1 2 3 4 5 6\\n44 Organic Cages as Selective Sorbents \\n \\n \\n \\n9 12\\nIsomer Mixture (X)\\nX + CC3-R\\nt (min)  \\n \\nFigure 3-2 | Selective adsorption of xylene isomers into CC3-R.

Boiling point equivalence \\nmeans that, in racemic samples, their headspace concentration should be equal and, \\nin non-racemic samples, unequal.[138] In practice, this means that after exposing a \\nracemic mixture to CC3-R, the measurement of inequivalent enantiomer peak areas \\nindicates chiral adsorption. To compliment this ease of measurement, a variety of \\nracemic mixtures was sourced via a four step screening procedure which involved \\nidentification, shortlisting, method development, and analysis. \\nRacemic mixture identification involved using chemical databases. Mixtures that met \\nthree primary criteria were chosen. First, so that they are likely fit inside the pores of \\nCC3, mixture components had a maximum molecular weight of 250 g mol-1. Second, \\nto prevent possible hydrolysis of CC3’s imine moieties, the mixtures’ pKas were be-\\ntween 5 and 9. Finally, to make them suitable for GC analysis, mixtures’ had a \\nmaximum boiling point of 200 °C. This procedure identified 182 eligible racemic \\nmixtures. \\nScreening for Selective Sorption Behaviour 45 \\n  \\n \\n \\nShortlisting of the mixtures reduced them down to a more manageable number. Mix-\\ntures were chosen to span a wide variety of different chemical systems but safety, \\nshelf-life, and price were also taken into account. A total of 65 systems for GC meth-\\nod development were chosen at the end of this step (full list in Appendix, p137). \\nBecause the shortlisted mixtures spanned a broad range of functionalities, GC meth-\\nod development was another part of the screening process. To accurately measure any \\ndeviations from ee = 0, a GC method that achieved near-baseline separation of the \\nmixture was required. However, for most systems, bespoke GC methods were re-\\nquired to achieve this separation, which was quite challenging. The development of \\nbespoke methods was achieved iteratively and, overall, 16 systems were separated via \\nGC for adsorption analysis. \\nAdsorption analysis on these sixteen mixtures identified that six enantioselectively \\nadsorb into CC3-R (Table 3-1). Selectivity was mirrored for CC3-S. For example, \\ninequivalent enantiomer peak areas were measured after exposing rac-3-\\nhydroxytetrahydrofuran to CC3-R (Figure 3-3, top) but no inequivalent was observed \\nafter exposure to rac-CC3 (middle). Additionally, the inverse was seen in CC3-S \\n(bottom).

No chiral selec-\\ntivity was seen for rac-CC3. Opposite chiral adsorption was seen between CC3-R and CC3-S; \\nhowever, due to inaccuracies in the technique, ee values were not precisely mirrored.  \\n3.2 Developing a Quantitative Technique for Measuring Selective \\nSorption \\nWhile this technique was capable of screening through a variety of systems, identify-\\ning several guest mixtures that CC3 can separate, it was not suitable for quantitative \\nanalysis because of its low reproducibility (Figure 3-4). This was an issue since, in \\norder to rationalise the behaviour of CC3, selectivity values needed to be compared \\nwith other techniques—for example, selectivities yielded from computational models \\nand from crystallographic measurements—with a high degree of accuracy. \\nThe source of low reproducibility was deemed to be due to uneven host-guest mixing. \\nGuest molecular weights were, on average, an order of magnitude lower than CC3. \\nConsequently, in order to achieve an equimolar guest:CC3 ratio, small volumes of \\nguests were added. These volumes were too small to mobilise the CC3 powder to \\nslurry, which resulted in poor mixing of the guest and host. A solvent could have \\nbeen used to circumvent this issue; however, two effects complicate this. First, CC3-R \\nmay have dissolved or recrystallised in the solvent, which might have affected its \\nuptake and selectivity. Second, solvent molecules could have displaced the guest of  \\n \\nDeveloping a Quantitative Technique for Measuring Selective Sorption 47 \\n  \\n \\n \\n0.9 3.5\\n-3.2\\n42\\nee (%)\\nrac-1-PE : CC3-R (molar equiv.)\\nR2 = 0.78\\n \\n \\nFigure 3-4 | Poor guest mixing reduces reproducibility.

These concerns were confirmed by experimental measurements, which indi-\\ncated that measured enantiomeric excesses were highly affected by solvent (Figure \\n3-5). \\nInterestingly, selectivity was less affected by sterically bulky solvents. Indeed, the \\nhighest excesses were recorded for the bulkiest: 3,5-di-tert-butyltoluene (45 %). This \\nis probably because bulkier solvents have difficulty entering the pores of CC3 and, as \\na consequence, are unable to displace or compete with the guest of interest. This is \\ncreates a ‘voids in slurry’ effect wherein guests exchange with CC3 with minimal \\nsolvent interruption.[139] In the context of these studies, this observation was particu-\\nlarly useful because it identified solvents that evenly distribute guests among the host \\nwithout affecting the host-guest interaction. \\nFurther measurements were performed using 1-tert-butyl-3,5-dimethylbenzene as a \\nsolvent. This was chosen in preference to 3,5-di-tert-butyltoluene, which produced \\nslightly higher excesses, because, at the time of experimentation, it was about 10x \\ncheaper. The use of 1-tert-butyl-3,5-dimethylbenzene significantly improved repro-\\nducibility when compared with solvent-free measurements; however, calibration fits \\nwere still not to an acceptable standard (R2 > 0.99).

In most \\ncases, R2 > 0.999 was achieved in subsequent calibration fits. \\nThese changes are implemented in subsequent analyses presented in this Chapter. In \\nmost cases, activated CC3 samples were exposed to stocks of guests dissolved in 1-\\ntert-butyl-3,5-dimethyl benzene containing small (<2 mg mL-1) quantities of bromo-\\nmesitylene. The resulting slurries were then stirred overnight and filtered. The filtrates \\nwere analysed by static-headspace GC-FID to determine the quantity of guest re-\\nmaining (see Experimental Section 7.2.1, p103, for analysis method). \\nExplaining Selective Sorption Behaviour 49 \\n  \\n \\n \\n3.3 Explaining Selective Sorption Behaviour \\nWith this improved technique, values such as the moles of CC3 (nCC3), the added \\nstock concentration (ca), the added stock volume (V) and the guest concentration \\nafter adsorption (cm) were known to a high degree of accuracy and, using these, sev-\\neral additional metrics were calculated. \\nThe percentage of guest adsorbed (Equation 3-1) showed the efficacy of adsorption \\nand the remaining guest in solution after adsorption. Discussions of selectivity and \\nthermodynamic competition shall primarily use this metric (e.g. Figure 3-6). In later \\ndiscussions, sorption behavior is rationalised by using modelling and crystallography, \\ntwo host-centric techniques that tend to generate molecular-scale values. According-\\nly, two host-centric measures of adsorption behaviour were also calculated: \\nequivalents adsorbed (Equation 3-3) and the enantiomeric excess of guests within the \\nhost (eehost, Equation 3-4). The former described uptake relative to the moles of cage. \\nThe latter provided a host-centric perspective of selectivity. \\nThese metrics were valuable when attempting to understand the host-guest behaviour \\nof CC3. To simplify rationalizations, two assumptions were made. First, adsorption \\nwas likely to be an exothermic but entropically unfavourable process. Second, adsorp-\\ntion (Scheme 3-1a) and substitution (b) were assumed to describe most of the \\ninteractions occurring and other, more complicated, processes may be ignored. \\nAdsorption (Scheme 3-1, a) should dominate when the host contains empty sites and \\ndepletes the solution phase of guests that would otherwise exchange with adsorbed \\nguests. While the adsorption enthalpy for one guest may be larger than another, the \\nadsorption of both guests is strongly favoured. Because of this, adsorption-dominated \\nprocesses are likely to observe weaker selectivity. \\n \\nPercent of Guest Adsorbed\\t=\\t cmca \\t×\\t100 Equation 3-1 \\nnads\\t=\\t(ca\\t-\\t\\tcm)V Equation 3-2 \\nEquivalents Adsorbed\\t= nadsnhost Equation 3-3 \\neehost\\t=\\t nRads\\t\\t-\\t\\tnSadsnRads\\t\\t+\\t\\tnSads \\t×\\t100 Equation 3-4 \\n \\n50 Organic Cages as Selective Sorbents \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nScheme 3-1 | Substitution may be calculated in terms of differences between adsorption en-\\nthalpies. In the case of the CC3-R acting as a host for 1-PE, adsorption is thermodynamically \\npreferred both enantiomers, so both should be adsorbed non-selectively. However, when substitu-\\ntion becomes the dominant process, the greater adsorption enthalpy of (R)-1-PE when compared \\nwith (S)-1-PE leads to selectivity. This is because the enthalpy change of substitution is affected by \\nthe difference, rather than the absolute value of, adsorption enthalpies between two guest pairs. \\nGuest substitution (Scheme 3-1, b) should dominate when host sites are filled and \\nsufficient guest remains in the solution phase. Unlike adsorption, substitution couples \\ntwo host-guest systems. Because the enthalpy of substitution is the difference between \\nthe adsorption enthalpy of the incoming guest and the desorption enthalpy of the \\nevacuated one (Scheme 3-1, bottom), the equilibrium position of substitution is \\nacutely affected by the differences of adsorption/desorption enthalpies between two \\nguests. Consequently, substitution-dominated processes should observe stronger \\nselectivity than adsorption-dominated processes. \\nMeasurements were performed to investigate these hypotheses (Figure 3-6). They \\nmeasured the amount of 1-PE adsorbed (black lines), measured ee (red lines), and in-\\nhost ee (blue lines) at various mixing times (Figure 3-6, a), mixing temperatures (b) \\nand ratios of rac-1-PE to CC3-R (c). These measurements underlined the usefulness \\nof calculated metrics as directly measured excesses tended to give a misleading im-\\npression of selectivity. For example, the highest measured excesses were recorded at \\nthe longest mixing times; however, calculations indicated the opposite effect on selec-\\ntivity within the host. Adsorbance measurements helped explain this observation: up \\nto 82 % of the available 1-PE was adsorbed at lower ratios so, while directly measured  \\nExplaining Selective Sorption Behaviour 51 \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\nexcesses were high, they only represented the 18 % of 1-PE that remained in solution \\nafter depletion. \\nIn-host excesses trended downward with increasing mixing time (Figure 3-6a).

In this scenario, the substitution of 1-PE molecules with the \\nparticles’ surfaces dominated and, consequently, in-host excesses were high. After \\nfurther mixing, adsorption dominated by indiscriminately depleting the solution of \\n1-PE which accordingly decreased in-host excesses. The trend of decreasing selectivi-\\nty appeared to stop once particles were saturated and the system had reached \\nequilibrium. \\nIn-host excesses trended upwards with increasing temperature (Figure 3-6b). This \\nwas likely to be a consequence of increased 1-PE desorption at raised temperatures. \\nAdsorption is an entropically unfavourable process, consequently, increasing temper-\\nature favoured desorption (black line trended downward). While this lowered the \\noverall uptake of 1-PE, it increased the proportion of 1-PE molecules in solution to \\nengage in substitution processes, which increased in-host excesses. The trend of in-\\ncreasing selectivity may continue up to a temperature where adsorption becomes a \\nnon-spontaneous process or, more likely, the host decomposes. However, the propor-\\ntion of adsorbed 1-PE would have been negligible before that point. \\nIn-host excesses trended upwards with increasing rac-1-PE:CC3-R ratios (Figure \\n3-6c). At lower ratios, adsorption dominated by indiscriminately depleting the solu-\\ntion of available 1-PE to fill vacant CC3-R, which led to low in-host excesses. At \\nhigher ratios, there was adequate 1-PE available to fill the CC3-R with enough re-\\nmaining for subsequent substitution processes to dominate, which accordingly \\nincreased in-host excesses. This trend of increasing excesses appeared to taper off \\nfrom a 1.75 rac-1-PE:CC3-R ratio which indicated that excesses would eventually \\nconverge to a value that is representative of the substitution mechanism’s equilibrium \\npoint. \\nAcross all three investigations, measured ee values (red lines) trended upwards with \\nadsorption (black lines) while in-host ee values (blue lines) followed the opposite \\ntrend. This reinforced the hypothesis that, in order to optimise selectivity, guest sub-\\nstitution should be maximised.  Overall, quantitative development enabled this \\nphenomenon to be measured; however, these approaches were unable to elucidate the \\nmolecular source of selectivity.

In some cases, guests were desorbed from \\nguest-adsorbed solids by repeating the process (from step 2) with excess acetonitrile \\nto yield extracted-guest filtrates and guest-desorbed solids. Overall, this approach \\nyielded both solid- and solution-phase samples after guest-adsorption and guest-\\nextraction processes. Four forms of CC3 were investigated: CC3-R, CC3-S, rac-CC3, \\nand CC3-R+S (an equimolar mixture of CC3-R and CC3-S). Measurements were \\nperformed in triplicate across seven different rac-1-PE:CC3 ratios. \\nModelling CC3’s Enantioselective Sorption Behaviour 55 \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nFigure 3-8 | Experimental workflow for performing and analysing host-guest exchange.

For some samples, the process was repeated from step 2 with acetonitrile to yield extract-\\ned-guest filtrates and guest-desorbed solids. \\n \\nGC measurements on guest-depleted filtrates were similar to previous discussions; \\nhowever, the four forms of CC3 could be directly compared within a single experi-\\nment (Figure 3-9). As with previous measurements, there existed some impurity \\npeaks in the baseline. These were straightforwardly removed by background subtrac-\\ntion. Encouragingly, CC3-R and CC3-S produced precisely mirrored enantiomeric \\nexcesses while rac-CC3 produced no measurable excess. The equivalents adsorbed for \\neach sample were calculated from these measurements (Equation 3-3, p49). The re-\\nsulting trends are plotted in Figure 3-12. \\nGuest-excluded filtrates, which contained guests excluded from within the host after \\nan acetonitrile washout, were also measured by GC-FID (Figure 3-10). Unlike meas-\\nurements on guest-deprived solutions where in-host excesses must be subsequently \\ncalculated, guest-excluded filtrates directly represented in-host excesses. However, \\nonly enantiomeric excesses could be used from these measurements as the washout \\nand filtration processes precluded accurate quantification. Specifically, the bromome-\\nsitylene peak, which is used to quantify uptake, was invalidated by the filtration and \\nwashout steps. \\nIn guest-excluded washouts, bromomesitylene was observed to have a greatly reduced \\nsignal relative to 1-PE. The observed weak signal indicated that bromomesitylene had, \\nas hypothesised, difficulty adsorbing into CC3, which reinforced the viability of using \\nit as a non-interrupting internal standard. Its adsorption is likely to be even lower \\nthan measured because much of the recorded signal is from surface residue – bro-\\nmomesitylene’s high boiling point and viscosity prevented its removal by filtration. \\nChoose\\nSolid-Phase Analyses\\nLiquid-Phase Analyses\\n1 2 3 4\\nRepeat from step 2, using a small solvent.\\nPXRD\\nTGA\\nFTIR\\nSEM\\nGC-FID\\nHPLC\\n56 Organic Cages as Selective Sorbents \\n \\n \\n \\n16 26\\nS\\nX + rac-CC3\\nX + CC3-S\\nX + CC3-R\\nR\\n*\\neeR = -33 %\\neeR = 0 %\\neeR = 33 %\\nt (min)\\nStarting Solution (X)\\neeR = 0 %\\n \\n \\nFigure 3-9 | GC-FID chromatograms of guest-deprived filtrates.

However, on comparing indirectly-calculated to directly-measured \\nvalues, both methods appeared to produce similar results (Figure 3-11). Differences \\nare likely to be a consequence of the indirect nature of back-calculated values, which \\nrelied on several metrics which were difficult to calibrate. \\nAs discussed previously, higher guest:host ratios produced higher selectivities. Like-\\nwise, the same observation was made in this study but direct comparisons between \\ndifferent forms of CC3 could be made (Figure 3-12). The measured selectivities (solid \\nlines) of CC3-R were opposite to CC3-S while rac-CC3 and CC3-R+S showed no \\nselectivity.

Approximately equal and opposite \\nexcess values were measured for CC3 enantiomers.  Near-zero excesses were observed for rac-\\nCC3 and CC3-R+S. A similar level of guest adsorption, with an average maximum of 1.09 equiva-\\nlents, was measured for all but rac-CC3. The higher maximum adsorbance measured for rac-CC3 \\n(1.46 equivalents) is likely due to its more rapid crystallisation process, which produced smaller \\nparticles and an increased level of voids/defects in the solid, as described previously.[50]  \\n \\nDiffering uptake values (Figure 3-12, dotted lines) were observed for rac-CC3, which \\nreached 1.46 equivalents of 1-PE per cage.

A more rapid crystallisation process is used to synthesise rac-CC3 \\nwhich results in increased voids/defects in its solid-phase structure and a smaller \\nparticle size.[50] This could explain why rac-CC3 was capable of adsorbing a greater \\namount of 1-PE; however, greater adsorption could also have been due to rac-CC3’s \\nlower solubility in the guest mixtures.  \\nHPLC was therefore used to measure the amount of CC3 dissolved in guest-deprived \\nsolutions (Figure 3-13).

The solubility \\nof CC3-R in pure 1-tert-butyl-3,5-dimethylbenzene solvent is 0.67 mg mL-1. CC3 is normally \\npoorly soluble because the solvent has difficulty entering CC3’s pores; however, because it can fit, \\n1-PE appears to affect the solubility of homochiral CC3 species. rac-CC3 is in an insoluble form of \\nCC3; accordingly, the presence of 1-PE appears to have no effect. The chiral conglomerate, CC3-\\nR+S, does dissolve slightly but, upon dissolution, it begins to form insoluble rac-CC3, preventing \\nit from reaching equivalent concentrations to the homochiral forms. \\ndissolution of homochiral CC3 appeared to be dependent on the equivalents of 1-PE \\n(red and blue lines). Experiments indicated that the solubility of CC3-R in pure \\n1-tert-butyl-3,5-dimethylbenzne solvent is only 0.7 mg mL-1 (experiment 7.2.3.10, \\np111), which is likely because it is too large to maximise its surface interaction with \\nthe internal void of CC3. However, because it does fit in the cage, 1-PE was capable of \\naiding dissolution. Non-racemic forms of CC3 dissolved to a maximum concentra-\\ntion of 2.1 mg mL-1, around 7 % of the available solid. This effect is insufficient to \\naccount for the difference in adsorption between homochiral and racemic species by \\nitself, so it is likely that the difference is a combination of this effect and the afore-\\nmentioned difference of surface area between the species. \\nA further observation is that the solubility of CC3-R+S appeared to be invariant to \\nthe amount of 1-PE, dissolving to a mean concentration of 0.26 mg mL-1 (Figure 3-13, \\ngreen line). However, this is slightly misleading since the chiral conglomerate is likely \\nto spontaneously form insoluble rac-CC3 precipitates upon dissolution. Indeed, ex-\\nperimental observations noted a slight cloudiness in higher-equivalent samples, \\n60 Organic Cages as Selective Sorbents \\n \\n \\nwhich was likely to the rac-CC3 precipitate. However, because a small quantity of \\nprecipitate was produced, it was not possible to confirm that the solid was entirely \\nrac-CC3. However, this explanation would account for the marginally higher adsorp-\\ntion of CC3-R+S compared to homochiral samples (Figure 3-12, green dotted line). \\nWhile the partial dissolution of CC3 is concerning, it did not significantly affect the \\ngeneral observations presented.  The subsequent application of this separation effect \\ncould avoid dissolution entirely by chemically bonding to a support, crosslinking, or, \\nas reported in Chapter 4, performing solvent-free gas-phase separations.  \\nAnother point of interest is whether host-guest exchange involved any irreversible \\nchemical changes in the host. 1H NMR measurements indicated no such changes \\n(Figure 3-14). The rac-1- PE guest appears to introduce additional chemical environ-\\nments into the spectrum without affecting CC3’s. An absence of chemical changes in \\nCC3 was further supported by FTIR and TGA measurements (appendix, p141-142). \\n9 6 3 0\\nCC3-R\\nCC3-R : 1-PE\\n\\uf064 (ppm)\\nCC3-R (post vacuum) \\n \\n \\nFigure 3-14 | 1H NMR (CDCl3) spectra of CC3-R at different stages of host-guest exchange. 1.5 \\n1-PE:CC3-R equivalents were present for the exchange process of these representative samples. \\nCC3-R, 1-PE, and residual 1-tert-butyl-3,5-dimethylbenzene solvent were observed after mixing \\n(middle).

Encouragingly, PXRD measurements \\nindicated that the crystal phase of CC3 remained the same throughout the process \\n(Figure 3-15). SEM analysis of the samples further reinforced this observation and \\nindicated that, while the exchange process appeared to wash away small debris, it did \\nnot significantly alter the overall crystal morphology of CC3 (Figure 3-16). \\nscXRD techniques were also utilised to measure the crystallographic properties of \\nCC3 during guest exchange.

As found with PXRD measurements, the \\ncrystal phase of CC3 did not measurably change when 1-PE is present. Additionally, \\nwhile 1-PE molecules were disordered within the structure of CC3, preventing their \\nrefinement, electron count calculations indicated that approximately 1.15 equiv. of 1-\\nPE molecules were present per CC3 molecule, which is close to saturation values \\nfound by the GC-FID measurements (c.a. 1.05 equiv.). \\n \\n890\\n34024\\n860\\n20858\\n4 50\\n923\\n19839\\n \\nrac-1-PE washed out\\nI (counts)\\nrac-1-PE vacuumed out\\nCC3\\n \\n2\\uf071 (degrees)  \\n \\nFigure 3-15 | Phase stability of CC3 during host-guest exchange.

It used \\n1-tert-butyl-3,5-dimethylbenzene as a solvent because it had a minimal effect on host-\\nguest interactions, likely due to its size exclusion (Figure 3-5, p48). This procedure \\nwas found to be reproducible across repeat experiments (see Appendix, p138), and \\nwas used to investigate the rac-1-PE:CC3 host-guest system in greater detail. Specifi-\\ncally, mixing time, temperature, and guest amount were all found to affect observed \\nuptake (Figure 3-6, p51). \\n \\n0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0\\n-30\\n-15\\n0\\n15\\n30  CC3-R rac-CC3\\n CC3-S\\nee\\nS (\\n%)\\nGuest : Host (molar equiv.)\\na b\\n1 2 3 4 5\\n-30\\n-15\\n0\\n15\\n30\\n rac-CC3\\n CC3-S\\nee\\nS (\\n%)\\nSimulation\\n CC3-R\\nConclusions & Outlook 65 \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nMolecular simulations indicated that the source of chiral selectivity was favourable \\nintermolecular interactions, including the formation of a hydrogen bond, between \\nCC3-R and (S)-1-PE that does not exist between CC3-R and (R)-1-PE (Figure 3-7, \\np53). In order to substantiate these models, a procedure was developed to analyze the \\nhost-guest process (Figure 3-8, p55). CC3-R, CC3-S, rac-CC3, and CC3-R+S were \\nexposed to rac-1-PE solutions and analysed with a variety of techniques. No chemical \\n(Figure 3-14, p59) or morphological (Figure 3-15, p61) changes in CC3 were measured \\nduring host-guest exchange, indicating that it is a reversible intermolecular \\nhost-guest interaction that could be further applied in other separation technologies. \\nChiral selectivity was only observed for homochiral CC3 and measured ee values \\naligned well with computational simulations (Figure 3-18, p64). \\nAs outlined, exploiting the behaviour of a porous material requires a robust under-\\nstanding of its function. The experiments in this Chapter identified the source of \\nchiral selectivity in CC3, its behaviour under a range of experimental conditions, and \\nshowed its stability throughout. All of these are important considerations when estab-\\nlishing which technologies CC3 could be applied to. Further, more organic cages have \\npossible additional advantages over extended frameworks. An example of exploiting \\nthe unique properties of solubility to create usable separation technologies is present-\\ned in the next Chapter. \\n  \\n66 Organic Cages as Selective Sorbents \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n  \\n \\n Ch4\\nwi\\n \\n \\n \\n \\nrom\\nth O\\natog\\nrgan\\n \\nraph\\nic Ca\\nic S\\nges \\nepar\\n \\nation\\n \\ns \\n68 Chromatographic Separations with Organic Cages \\n \\n \\nThis Chapter presents the development of CC3 as gas chromatography (GC) station-\\nary phase (see Section 6.1, p89, for chromatography explanation). Several \\ninvestigations are presented: the production of CC3-coated capillary columns; meas-\\nurement of the separation behaviour of the resulting columns, which aligned well \\nwith investigations presented in Chapter 3, and; continuing from the investigations of \\nChapter 3, rationalization of the thermodynamics and kinetics of CC3’s separation \\nbehaviour. \\nThe research presented in this chapter contributed directly to a Chemistry of Materials \\npublication “Porous Organic Cages for Gas Chromatography Separations”.[140] \\n4.1 Producing a GC Column \\nThis Chapter focuses on the production of GC columns, rather than HPLC columns, \\nfor reasons discussed in the introduction (p17). GC columns are generally in packed \\nor open-tubular capillary format. While packed columns have been demonstrated to \\nperform interesting separations,[141] wall-coated open-tubular capillary columns are \\nmuch more widely used because they are highly efficient, robust, and have generally \\nhigh inertness.[99,117] However, due to their narrow diameters, high-quality coatings of \\ninsoluble materials can be difficult to produce inside capillaries.  \\nThe dynamic coating method is used in studies that utilise insoluble microporous \\nmaterials. In dynamic coatings, a plug of slurried/concentrated stationary phase is \\npushed through the column under pressure. It is usually employed in conjunction \\nwith a dispersion method such as extended sonication.[125] Alternative approaches, \\nsuch as layer-by-layer synthesis[142] or polymerization[143] have also been reported but \\nare less widely used and are complex.  By contrast, the static coating method, where \\ncapillaries are filled with coating solutions and the solvent is removed by evaporation, \\nis commonly used in commercial processes because it is straightforward and produc-\\nes a uniform coating inside the capillary.[117] However, in static coatings, the stationary \\nphase must either be soluble or a stable nanosuspension.[144]  \\nGC with a solid sorbent as the stationary phase, or gas-solid chromatography (GSC), \\nis generally less attractive than gas-liquid chromatography (GLC). This because of the \\nnonlinear adsorption isotherm of many solid sorbents, which makes the peaks ob-\\ntained in GSC more asymmetric than GLC.[117] Further, solid sorbents commonly \\nused in GSC have a much stronger interaction with guests than liquid stationary \\nphases, which makes it difficult to separate polar or high-boiling-point compounds. \\nChiral Separations with a CC3-R Stationary Phase 69 \\n  \\n \\nAccordingly, many high-performance stationary phases are liquid films. In those \\ncases, a stationary phase, such as a per-methylated β-cyclodextrin,[116] is dissolved in a \\nsimpler phase, such as a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) and coated with the static \\nmethod. Generally speaking, analyte exchange is faster in liquid films, which tends to \\nproduce sharper peaks in the resulting chromatogram. \\nInitial column production attempts tried to mimic the liquid films of commercial \\ncolumns. CCX-S, the soluble novel cage presented in Chapter 2, was used because it \\ndid not precipitate from PDMS liquids. However, after coating, the resulting column \\nretained some compounds but produced very broad peaks and no particularly inter-\\nesting separation behaviour (see Appendix, p143). Broad peaks are likely due to the \\npresence of tertiary amines within the structure of the cage: basicity can cause sta-\\ntionary phases to over-retain analytes, resulting in peak tailing. Separation behaviour \\nwas difficult to rationalise because little is known about the host-guest behaviour of \\nCCX-S. Accordingly, column production attempts were refocused on producing a \\nsolid porous layer open tubular (PLOT)[110,117,143] column using a better-understood \\norganic cage, CC3. \\nFindings from the previous Chapter and other studies[49] indicated that CC3 should \\nbe capable of chiral and molecular shape separations. The value of separating each \\nsystem is discussed in the introduction. Additionally, CC3’s solubility makes it suita-\\nble for the static-coating technique. However, while CC3 may perform these \\nseparations as a selective sorbent, column development is required to adapt it to per-\\nform well as a chromatographic stationary phase.  \\n4.2 Chiral Separations with a CC3-R Stationary Phase \\nIn initial attempts, a 6 mg mL-1 solution of CC3-R in dichloromethane was used \\nwhich, according to calculations (Equation 4-1),[117] resulted in a 0.375 μm thick film. \\nThis was thicker than most commercial columns, which usually have a film thickness \\nof 0.12 μm, to ensure that a separation effect would be observed. However, because \\nthe film was too thick, mixtures separated on the column produced broad signals \\n(Figure 4-1b). This was rectified by reducing the concentration of the coating solution \\nto 3 mg mL-1, which yielded a calculated film thickness of 0.19 μm and much more \\ndefined separation effect (Figure 4-1c). \\n \\n df\\t\\t=\\t\\t2.5 ×\\tdc\\t\\t×\\t\\t(% conc. of coating soln) Equation 4-1 \\n70 Chromatographic Separations with Organic Cages \\n \\n \\n \\nSeparations, as in Figure 4-1, were noted to be broader than separations performed \\non commercial columns. The reason for this is hypothesised to be the morphology of \\nthe coating, which was likely to consist of many sizes of CC3-R particles. During \\nelution, analytes may become temporarily adsorbed into larger particles and take \\ntime to desorb back into the mobile phase which, overall, manifests itself as a broad-\\nening effect. Attempts to improve this issue are discussed later, where prefabricated \\nrac-CC3 nanoparticles are used. However, while broadening is a concern, CC3-R was \\nmeasured to have strong enough selectivity to overcome broadening effects. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nFigure 4-1 | Tuning column performance.

Headspace analysis also indicated that pentane \\ncould also be separated by the column but it coelutes with the solvent in liquid injec-\\ntions (see Appendix, Figure 10-23, p145). The separation of alkanes is a well-\\nestablished GC process and is a consequence of the large differences in boiling \\npoints.[117] Indeed, control experiments showed that heavier alkanes (C10+) will sepa-\\nrate on a blank column due to this effect (see Appendix, p144).  \\nIn contrast to the separation of compounds by boiling point, chiral separations occur \\nby favourable diastereomer-forming mechanisms such as hydrogen bonding, metal \\ncoordination, or inclusion.[112] As a result, it can be quite difficult to separate a race-\\nmate unless the stationary phase has a high selectivity for it. Chapter 3 presented the \\nsource of homochiral CC3’s chiral selectivity towards 1-phenylethanol (1-PE) to be \\nfavourable intermolecular interactions, which promoted the adsorption of (S)-1-PE \\ninto CC3-R more than (R)-1-PE. Encouragingly, separations performed on the \\nCC3-R column corroborated that study. The column separated rac-1-PE, retaining \\n(S)-1-PE more than (R)-1-PE (Figure 4-3).  \\n \\n0 15\\nC12\\nC11\\nC10\\nC9\\nC8\\nC7\\nt (min)\\nC6\\nSolvent\\n \\n \\nFigure 4-2 | Separation of linear alkanes using a CC3-R column.

Enantiomer labels (R/S) were found by meas-\\nurement of homochiral 1-PE samples. (S)-1-PE was more strongly retained than (R)-1-PE by the \\ncolumn, which corroborates previous observations presented in Chapter 3.  \\n \\nFurther chiral separations on the CC3-R column indicated that it was highly selective \\ntowards particular systems. Specifically, a high selectivity for 2-substituted alcohols \\nwas observed (Figure 4-4). The column separated a seven-component mixture of \\n2-substituted racemic alcohols. Further, headspace measurements indicated that the \\ncolumn strongly separates alcohols from methanol onwards (see Appendix, p147). \\nEstablishing the source of such strong selectivity merited further investigation. As \\ndiscussed in Chapter 3, selectivity is likely to be due to similar selective hydrogen-\\nbond formation that occurs when separating rac-1-PE mixtures. This explanation is \\nfurther reinforced when studying isostructural amines, which also separated on the \\ncolumn (Figure 4-5). Indeed, when comparing rac-1-PE to isostructural rac-α-\\nmethylbenzylamine, the same order of elution—R followed by S—was observed. \\nThe column was unable to separate racemates without hydrogen-bond-forming moie-\\nties, such as chiral alkanes or alkylaromatics. These systems can be particularly \\ndifficult to separate because weaker induced dipole, van der Waals, or π-stacking \\ninteractions[102] are the only handle for their differentiation. This indicated that ana-\\nlytes hydrogen-bonding moieties are the primary differentiator used by CC3-R to \\nseparate enantiomers. \\nChiral Separations with a CC3-R Stationary Phase 73 \\n  \\n \\n0 20\\n7\\n6\\n5\\n4\\n3\\n2S\\nt (min)\\nR\\n1\\nSolvent\\n \\n \\nFigure 4-4 | Separation of 2-substituted chiral alcohol mixture.

Based on previous discussions, one source of chiral selectivity is \\nlikely to be geometrically-restricted hydrogen-bond formation. Isostructural amines should be \\ncapable of forming such bonds with similar geometries to the alcohols and, accordingly, similar \\nseparation behavior was seen in these systems. \\n74 Chromatographic Separations with Organic Cages \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nSide chains that may interrupt hydrogen-bonding also appeared to have an effect on \\nselectivity. For example, while chiral separation was measured for rac-2-heptanol, \\nnone was seen for rac-3-heptanol (see Appendix, p148). This was likely due to the \\nadditional steric bulk of a C2H5 group when compared with –CH3. The conformation-\\nal motion of the latter is unlikely to interrupt hydrogen-bond formation while the \\nformer could. This explanation is corroborated when analysing a range of other ra-\\ncemic mixtures (Figure 4-6). For example, while no selectivity was seen in saturated \\n3-substituted compounds, it was seen in unsaturated equivalents, such as rac-1-\\npentyn-3-ol (c). The same was true for cyclic compounds, such as rac-3-\\nhydroxytetrahydrofuran (i).  \\nThis trend continued for other mixtures listed. Chiral diol compounds also separated \\non the column (g, h). However, the separation effect appeared to be weak, which is \\nlikely a consequence of non-stereospecific hydrogen-bonding from the achiral moie-\\nty. Other measurements gave the impression that separation was stronger when the \\nchiral moiety is at the 3 position (h); however, this was misleading because rac-2-\\nethyl-1,3-hexanediol contains two chiral centers and, as a consequence, the observed \\nseparation was likely the separation of diastereomers.  \\nIn an attempt to understand the energetics of separation, the enthalpy and entropy of \\nassociation with CC3-R was calculated from Van’t Hoff relationships (method in \\nexperimental Section, 7.3.3, p113). Calculated values are presented in Table 4-1. In \\ngeneral, a 5-8 kJ mol-1 enthalpy and 10 J mol-1 K-1 entropy difference was measured \\nbetween enantiomers. Simulated values[66] yielded larger energy differences \\n(28.5 kJ mol-1); however, these were calculated at 0 K from the most favourable con-\\nfiguration of a single 1-PE molecule per unit cell of CC3-R. By contrast, experimental \\ncalculations yielded values under standard conditions with an indeterminate ratio of \\n1-PE : CC3-R. Further, these experimental values are affected by imperfections in the \\ncoating, surface binding, and by diffusion within the crystallite. Hence, differences \\nbetween experimental and computational values are to be expected. \\n  \\nChiral Separations with a CC3-R Stationary Phase 75 \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n0 4\\nc)b)\\nt (min)\\na)\\n0 6\\nOH\\n0 70 6\\nd)\\n0 13\\nj)\\ni)h)g)\\nf)e)\\n0 17\\n0 9 0 13 0 8\\n0 2\\nNH2\\nl)k)\\n0 4\\nNH2\\n0 9\\nOH\\n \\nFigure 4-6 | Other chiral separations on the CC3-R column.

However, while some of these separations may be difficult to \\nperform, many can be performed on commercially available columns. By contrast, \\nfewer columns are capable of separating mixtures by molecular shape. The Cooper \\ngroup previously reported that CC3-R may perform shape separations.[49] According-\\nly, these kinds of separations were investigated with the column but, due to the \\nbroadening effect observed in the presented chromatograms, the separations were not \\nquite baseline (e.g. Figure 4-8). To rectify this, further changes were made to the \\ndesign of the stationary phase. \\n4.3 Molecular Shape Separations with a rac-CC3 Stationary Phase \\nIdeally, exchange with the stationary phase should be rapid, retaining components for \\na narrowly-distributed duration of time which, as a consequence, should produce \\nsharp peaks in the chromatogram.[117] Unfortunately, this was not the case for some \\nseparations on the CC3-R column. In that case, it is likely that broadening was a \\nconsequence of non-linear adsorption into CC3-R crystallites within the column.  \\nPeak broadening issues are not unique to CC3. Similar issues were encountered in the \\ninitial development of β-Cyclodextrin (β-CD), the core of many commercial station-\\nary phases.[118,145] One major improvement to the efficiency of β-CD phases was their \\nper-methylation to make them suitably soluble to dissolve in polysiloxanes to form \\nMolecular Shape Separations with a rac-CC3 Stationary Phase 77 \\n  \\n \\nliquid films.[116] With respect to CC3, a similar approach would be ideal but no syn-\\nthetic preparation is available at the time of writing. Instead, attempts were made to \\nimprove the performance of CC3 columns through solid morphology control.  \\nThe Cooper group previously reported a method for producing stable, monodisperse, \\nrac-CC3 nanoparticle suspensions.[50] This approach was used to produce 5 mg mL-1 \\nsuspensions of rac-CC3 nanoparticles in dichloromethane which were subsequently \\ndiluted to 1 mg mL-1 and directly coated within the column. The resulting coating \\nthickness was calculated to be 0.0625 μm, which was thinner than the previous col-\\numn (0.19 μm) but, as discussed, thinner films should result in higher separation \\nefficiencies.[117] Unfortunately, the coating of prefabricated solids onto a surface be-\\nhaves quite differently from direct precipitation. The resulting coating was poorly \\nadhered to the columns surface. As a result, when the column was fitted and the mo-\\nbile phase of the gas chromatograph enabled, a stream of dislodged particles entered, \\nand coated, the detector to produce an intense signal. Consequently, it was clear that \\nfurther changes would need to be made to improve particle adherence. \\nThe adherence of solids to open tubular columns has been previously studied.[146] The \\nuse of an adhesive to stabilise particles was straightforwardly adopted into the \\nrac-CC3 coating solution. As before, a 1 mg mL-1 nanosuspension coating solution \\nwas produced but SP-2100, a commercially available PDMS GC stationary phase, was \\nalso added up to a concentration of 2.5 mg mL-1. This solution was coated using the \\nstatic method and, encouragingly, no intense detector signal due to particle dis-\\nlodgement was observed when using the resulting column (see expt. 7.3.4.3, p115).  \\nSEM images of the resulting column indicated the presence of particles within \\n(Figure 4-7). The average particle diameter measured from these images is c.a. 100 \\nnm, which is close to values measured in previous studies.[50] Improved column per-\\nformance, in the form of sharper peaks and better-defined separation, was measured \\nfor the rac-CC3 particle-coated column when compared with the CC3-R column \\n(Figure 4-8) which enabled the analysis of difficult-to-separate mixtures, such as \\nmixtures of compounds that may only be differentiated by their molecular shape.  \\nThe separation of xylene isomers is particularly well-studied because the isomers \\nhave defined molecular shapes that change negligibly with conformational motion. \\nAccordingly, previous studies showed the selective adsorption of xylene isomers into \\n \\n78 Ch\\n \\n \\nEm\\nFigure\\nlary co\\ncoated \\nwere tr\\nobserve\\nparticle\\n \\n0.0\\nFigure\\ncles.

The same association \\norder has been reported for other materials and the reverse may be achieved with \\nreverse shape selectivity, a phenomenon measured in a MOF, UiO-66.[126,147]  \\nColumns that separate compounds by molecular shape are particularly desirable \\nsince many difficult-to-separate mixtures are only differentiated by this property. \\nEncouragingly, the rac-CC3 column appeared to perform this class of separations. It \\nseparated xylene isomers with the expected elution order (Figure 4-9, left). The \\nshape-sorting effect was particularly strong when separating mesitylene from ben-\\nzene (Figure 4-9, right). The Cooper group previously reported that mesitylene has \\ndifficulty entering CC3.[49] Consequently, despite the boiling point of mesitylene be-\\ning 85 °C higher than benzene, it elutes through the rac-CC3 column quickest. In \\ngeneral, the order of elution in conventional GC separations should conform to the \\nboiling point of components;[117] however, the reverse is observed for these separa-\\ntions.  \\n \\n0 4\\nt (min)  \\n0 3\\nb.p. = 165 oC\\nb.p. = 80 oC\\n \\n \\nFigure 4-9 | Molecular-shape separations on the rac-CC3 nanoparticle column.

In both cases, the order of elution was the reverse of \\nthe components’ relative boiling points. Molecular shape sorting by CC3 has been previously re-\\nported.[49] The effect was particularly strong when comparing the retention time of mesitylene, \\nwhich cannot easily enter the pores of CC3, to benzene. Control experiments in Appendix (p148-\\n150). \\n80 Chromatographic Separations with Organic Cages \\n \\n \\nWhile the separation of xylene isomers was interesting, these separations may be \\nperformed on conventional β-CD-based stationary phases because the central ring of \\nCDs enables shape-selective inclusion mechanisms.[118] Indeed, the separation of \\nxylenes on a conventional β-CD column is presented in Chapter 3 (Figure 3-2, p44). \\nBy contrast, because π-π interactions are not available, fewer stationary phases are \\ncapable of differentiating similar alkane isomers. \\nRecently, the use of MOFs to separate hydrocarbons has received much attention.[3] \\nOne specifically noteworthy challenge is the separation of the five structural isomers \\nof hexane. In 2013, Long and coworkers reported the separation of hexane isomers \\nusing a MOF, Fe2BDP3, with triangular pores.[32] The triangular geometry, which is \\ndifficult to achieve in conventional zeolites, was reported to be optimal when separat-\\ning the mixture. In addition to MOFs, this window shape can be achieved in organic \\ncage compounds. CC3 is known to have a similar window shape and, coincidently, all \\nfive structural isomers of hexane were separated by both the CC3-R stationary phase \\n(Figure 4-8, top) and, with improved separation efficiency, the rac-CC3 nanoparticle \\nphase (Figure 4-10). This phenomenon was likely to be a consequence of the three-\\ndimensional diamondoid structure of CC3 which provided a rigid framework for \\nmolecular shape sorting.[148] \\nControl experiments indicated that rac-CC3 is responsible for the separation effect \\n(see Appendix, p150).

This was likely due to a combination of kinetic and sur-\\nface effects. With respect to kinetic effects, time-resolved computational models \\nindicated that the speed at which hexane isomers diffuse through CC3 follows the \\nsame pattern as experiments (Figure 4-12). n-Hexane diffuses quickest through rac-\\nCC3 while branched isomers diffuse more slowly. With respect to surface effects, \\nmodels assumed that most separation interactions occurred within the bulk struc-\\nture, not the surface, of CC3. However, the use of high surface-area-to-volume ratio \\nnanoparticles means that a significant proportion of interactions likely occurred at \\nthe surface. Further studies are required to fully quantify these effects. \\nA further point of interest was the robustness of the columns. In commercial envi-\\nronments, GC is a routine analysis technique in a wide variety of industries. There, \\nhigh-throughput and automated analysis are much more common and, accordingly, a \\nmajor point of interest is the stability of stationary phases. A long lifetime is desirable \\nfor any column coating. While short (<50 injections) lifetimes are acceptable for \\nprototypes; identifying long-term durability is an important step in the development \\nof a column. \\nThe CC3-R column was tested by repeatedly injecting rac-3-hydroxytetrahydrofuran \\nand measuring changes in the retention time of the eluted analytes (Figure 4-13). \\nDifferences in intensity could be attributed to the gradual depletion of sample head-\\nspace. No change in retention properties observed in these measurements. This is \\nlikely to be consequence of CC3’s stability. The Cooper group previously reported \\nthat CC3 may be boiled in water or heated to c.a. 250 °C with no observable chemical \\nchange.[149] Additionally, it was qualitatively noted that the retention behaviour of the \\ncolumn did not change over its entire use (>300 injections). \\nMolecular Shape Separations with a rac-CC3 Stationary Phase 83 \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\nFigure 4-12 | Diffusion of hexane’s five structural isomers through rac-CC3.

To investigate this, a hexane mixture was repeatedly \\ninjected 50 times (Figure 4-14) onto the rac-CC3 column. Encouragingly, no measur-\\nable performance changes or spikes were observed for these, or any other (>200), \\nchromatograms obtained when using the column.  \\nBoth column formats appeared to be stable over at least 200 injections in both cases. \\nFurther testing would be required to asses if they have the necessary robustness for \\nroutine industrial analyses (>5000 injections) but the results are impressive for a \\nprototypical stationary phase. The most popular commercial stationary phases consist \\nof esterified β-cyclodextrins which can be vulnerable to hydrolysis. By contrast, or-\\nganic cages may be derivatised by reduction followed by amide formation from acyl \\nhalides and acid anhydrides,[70] which is likely to result in a less-labile bond. This \\nopens up the opportunity to use organic cage compounds as a core for a range of \\ntailor-made stationary phases. \\n \\n0 9\\n2.9\\n4.3\\nS (pA)\\nt (min)  \\n \\nFigure 4-14 | Robustness of the rac-CC3 nanoparticle column.

(S)-1-PE was more strongly retained than (R)-1-PE by the \\ncolumn, which corroborates findings from the previous Chapter (Figure 4-3, p72). \\nLikewise, the separation of isostructural amine compounds on the CC3-R column \\nalso reinforces those findings (Figure 4-5, p73) and underlines the importance of \\nunderstanding host-guest interactions for establishing patterns of behaviour in a \\nseparation technology.  \\nTo improve separation performance, the CC3 stationary phase was further devel-\\noped. rac-CC3 nanoparticles were produced as in a literature method.[50] A GC \\ncolumn containing these particles glued on its inner surface was produced (Figure \\n4-7, p78). This development improved peak shape (Figure 4-10, p80) and enabled \\nmore-difficult separations, such as the shape-selective separation of all three xylene \\nisomers or benzene from mesitylene (Figure 4-9, p79), to be performed. The column \\nalso baseline separates all five isomers of hexane (Figure 4-10, p80), a particularly \\ndifficult mixture to separate.[32] Computational modelling indicated that the elution \\norder of hexane isomers likely depends on a combination of thermodynamically \\nfavourable van der Waals interactions of an isomer with rac-CC3 (Figure 4-11, p81) \\nand an isomers speed of diffusion through CC3’s extended structure (Figure 4-12, \\np83). \\nThere is also scope for the commercial adaption of CC3 as a GC stationary phase. \\nBoth the CC3-R and rac-CC3 columns displayed no change in retention ability over \\nrobustness-testing experiments (p83) or their use (>300 injections). Further, the \\namount of CC3 used in either column costs less than £1, a negligible proportion of \\nthe overall retail price of a GC column. \\nOverall, CC3 has been utilised as a stationary phase in GC columns. It is capable of \\nperforming specialist, in demand separations that are otherwise quite difficult. The \\nsource of these separation effects is molecular shape, molecular size, hydrogen bond-\\ning, or a mixture of all three. Further work includes expanding the number of \\ncompounds analysed on the columns to reveal which systems CC3 optimally sepa-\\n86 Chromatographic Separations with Organic Cages \\n \\n \\nrates. Additionally, there is a variety of other organic cage compounds[57,150,151] and \\ncage derivatives[70] available.

The static coating method, which is widely used in com-\\nmercial column production processes, was used to coat a capillary column with CC3-\\nR. This is in direct contrast to insoluble microporous materials, which require alter-\\nnative coating methods. The column was observed to be capable of separating \\nracemic alcohols and amines but the resulting chromatograms contained relatively \\nbroad signals when separating compounds with weaker differentiating moieties, such \\nas hexane isomers. To rectify this, an improved column was produced by coating with \\nprefabricated rac-CC3 nanoparticles. This column was capable of separating com-\\npounds by molecular shape and capably separated all five isomers of a hexane \\nmixture. The separation of hexane isomers has received much attention recently due \\nto its high value in industry. Both columns were observed to have excellent lifetimes, \\nwhich is important consideration for commercial interests. These developments have \\nopened up the possibility of using other organic cages, and their derivatives, in GC \\ncolumns to perform other difficult, high value, separations. \\nOverall, the research presented in this thesis highlights developments in the synthesis \\nand separation properties of organic cages. It has shown how modern advances, such \\nas in-silico and HT techniques, could potentially be incorporated augmented into \\nconventional synthetic preparations. The overarching objectives of the work were \\ntherefore successful, and as a result of this project, we have developed new HT meth-\\nods, new molecules, and new practical separation techniques.  \\n Ch6\\nCharacter\\nthesis.

A multi-component mixture \\nis introduced onto a column containing a stationary phase. Due to differences in affinity between \\ncomponents and the stationary phase, they travel through the column at different speeds which, \\nprovided affinity differences are sufficient, results in the separation of components. \\nvariety of metrics including a component’s concentration in the mixture or its chemi-\\ncal and physical properties. In general, there is a positive correlation between the \\nquantity of a component put onto a column and resultant signal. Consequently, com-\\nponent amounts in unknown mixtures may be calculated if the instrument has been \\ncalibrated. Calibration involves analysing standards of known concentration to calcu-\\nlate a relationship between recorded signal and concentration. In Chapter 3, this \\napproach is used extensively to calculate the concentration of experimental mixtures \\n(see experiment 7.2.1.1, p103). \\n6.1.1 Analytical Gas Chromatography (GC) \\nIn GC, both the analyte mixture and mobile phase are gaseous. Generally speaking, \\nGC instrumentation will have a heated injector to vaporise any introduced samples. \\nThe resulting gas is carried through the column with a gaseous mobile phase, usually \\nhelium or nitrogen, and gaseous components exchange onto a stationary phase as in \\nany chromatographic technique. Both packed-bed and capillary columns are stand-\\nard formats for GC. Capillary columns have, generally speaking, the highest \\nseparation efficacy, which is one reason why they are the focus of Chapter 4. This, \\ncombined with rapid component diffusion in the gas phase, results in GC usually \\nTime\\nIn\\nte\\nns\\nity\\nInjection\\nSeparation (b)\\nDetection (c)\\nStationary Phase (a)\\nAnalytical Chromatography 91 \\n  \\n \\nhaving a comparatively higher separation efficacy than HPLC and GPC.[152] However, \\na major drawback of GC is that analytes must be in the gas phase during separation; \\ntherefore, GC is unable to analyze compounds with high boiling points (> 300 °C \\napprox.). \\nA variety of detectors may be coupled to a GC system. A flame-ionization detector \\n(FID) is exclusively used in the GC analyses presented in this thesis.[153] As a brief \\noverview, FID detectors work by ionising components leaving the column in a flame, \\nthe ions register as a change in current across two electrodes. In organic compounds, \\ncarbon ions are the primary source of a signal. Two chemically equivalent com-\\npounds, such as chiral enantiomers, will register identical signal strengths per unit \\namount present. FID detectors are extremely sensitive (2 pg C s-1)[117] yet have a wide \\nsignal range. Generally speaking, signals have linear relationships with the amount of \\na component in the detector. However, the response may become non-linear if com-\\nponent amounts vary by orders of magnitude. A quadratic signal to component \\nconcentration relationship was used in calibrations for experiments presented in \\nChapter 3 for this reason (see experiment 7.2.1.1, p104, and fitting comparison in \\nAppendix, p138). \\nGC analyses presented in this thesis are performed as follows: All GC measure-\\nments were carried out using a Thermo Scientific TRACE 1310 instrument configured \\nwith an FID detector and the appropriate column (see specific experimental Chap-\\nter). Numeric integration and chromatographic calculations of the resulting peaks \\nwas performed using the supplied Chromeleon 7.1.2.1478 (Thermo Scientific Corpo-\\nration) software package. GC methods for all chromatograms presented in this thesis \\nare available in the Appendix (p126). \\n6.1.2 Analytical High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) \\nIn HPLC, both the analyte and the mobile phase are liquids or solutions. Samples are \\ninjected onto the column and pushed through, at high pressures, with a liquid mobile \\nphase. HPLC columns generally contain densely packed solid particles of stationary \\nphase.  \\nWhile HPLC may not have the raw separating efficiency of GC techniques, there is a \\nwider selection of specialist HPLC stationary phases which have strong selectivity \\ntowards certain chemical mixtures. More importantly, HPLC is capable of analysing \\n92 Characterization Techniques \\n \\n \\ncompounds with high boiling points, such as CC3. In Chapter 3, HPLC is used to \\nmeasure the amount of CC3 dissolved in experimental mixtures during a host-guest \\nexchange process.  \\nHPLC analyses presented in this thesis are performed as follows: All HPLC meas-\\nurements were carried out using a UltiMate 3000 system (Dionex) attached with a \\nUV/Vis diode array detector and equipped with a Syncronis C8 column (150 x 4.6 \\nmm, 3 um, Thermo Scientific, SN 10136940, Lot 12459). The mobile phase was meth-\\nanol at a flow rate of 0.5 mL min-1. The injection volume was 5 μL and samples were \\nprepared as described in respective carryouts. The column oven temperature was set \\nto 30 °C. The resulting chromatogram was collected from UV absorbances at 254 nm. \\nPeak areas were computed using the supplied Chromeleon 6.80 SR11 Build 3163 (Di-\\nonex) HPLC software. \\n6.1.3 Analytical Gel-Permeation Chromatography (GPC) \\nLike HPLC, solutions are injected onto the column and pushed through, at high pres-\\nsure, with a liquid mobile phase in GPC. Unlike HPLC, GPC columns contain gels \\nwhich separate components by size rather than chemical affinity. GPC was identified \\nto be capable of separating cage compounds by their relative size and is used in Chap-\\nter 2 to analyze complex reaction mixtures containing a range of cage-sized products. \\nGPC analyses presented in this thesis are performed as follows: All GPC measure-\\nments were carried on a TDA Model 302 (Viscotek) attached with a refractive index \\ndetector and equipped with a ViscoGEL HHR-H guard column and two ViscoGEL \\nGMHHR-H columns fitted in series. The mobile phase was chloroform at a flow rate \\nof 1 mL min-1. The injection volume was 100 μL and samples were prepared by dis-\\nsolving into chloroform to a concentration of c.a. 1 mg mL-1 followed by filtration \\nthrough a 0.2 μm PTFE syringe filter. The column oven temperature was set to 30 °C. \\nDetector calibration was performed using a low molecular weight narrow polystyrene \\nstandard (99 kDa). Signals were recorded using the OmniSEC 4.6 software suite. \\n6.2 Crystallography \\nCrystallography is a science that examines the arrangement of atoms in solids. Pro-\\nvided molecules pack into a regular motif with long-range order, the resulting solid \\nwill diffract x-rays. Diffraction patterns may be analysed by a variety of methods to \\nelucidate packing geometry and molecular structure. \\nCrystallography 93 \\n  \\n \\n6.2.1 Single-Crystal X-Ray Diffraction (scXRD) \\nscXRD is used to calculate the atomic structure of molecules within crystallised sol-\\nids. Here, a two-dimensional x-ray detector measures diffracted x-rays from a single \\ncrystal at a series of three-dimensional emitter-detector angles. The resulting diffrac-\\ntion patterns (e.g. Figure 6-2) can be used to calculate the structure of packed \\nmolecules within the crystal. Fundamentally, these calculations are based on princi-\\nples of symmetry, reciprocal space, and Bragg’s law; however, modern-day \\ncrystallography will also involve a range of computational algorithms to refine scXRD \\ndatasets (e.g. SHELXD in preparation below).  \\nA greater degree of crystal structure information is elucidated from scXRD than \\nPXRD measurements but the former is representative of a single crystal, not a bulk \\nquantity of sample. Consequently, it is common to use both techniques together. \\nscXRD datasets can be computed into PXRD patterns for comparison with experi-\\nmental measurements of bulk crystallinity.  \\nscXRD is used in two Chapters of this thesis: in Chapter 3, where it is used to meas-\\nure guest occupation in CC3’s structure after exposure to a variety of mixtures; and in \\nChapter 2, where it is used to elucidate the structure of CCX-S. \\n \\n  \\n \\nFigure 6-2 | scXRD (left) and PXRD (right) diffraction patterns. In scXRD, three-dimensional \\ndatasets are taken at each angle in order to calculate the three-dimensional arrangement of atoms \\nin a crysal structure. By contrast, because crystallites are randomly organised in a powder, less \\ninformation about the crystal structure can be calculated from PXRD measurements. However, \\npowders are more easily attainable and PXRD measurements are generally easier to perform. \\n94 Characterization Techniques \\n \\n \\nsxXRD analyses presented in this thesis are performed as follows: scXRD data was \\nmeasured on a Rigaku MicroMax-007 HF rotating anode diffractometer (Mo-Kα \\nradiation, λ = 0.71073 Å, Kappa 4-circle goniometer, Rigaku Saturn 724+ detector) or, \\nif stated, at beamline I19, Diamond Light Source, Didcot, UK, using silicon double \\ncrystal monochromated synchrotron radiation (λ = 0.6889 Å). Empirical absorption \\ncorrections using equivalent reflections were performed with the program SADABS. \\nStructure were solved with SHELXD,[154] or by direct methods using SHELXS,[154] and \\nreined by full-matrix least squares on F2 by SHELXL,[154] interfaced through the pro-\\ngram OLEX2. Unless stated, all non-H atoms were refined anisotropically and H \\natoms were fixed in geometrically estimated positions using the riding model. In the \\nabsence of heavy scatters Friedel pairs were merged. \\n6.2.2 Powder X-Ray Diffraction (PXRD) \\nIn PXRD, a detector measures the intensity of diffracted x-rays from a powder irradi-\\nated at a series of emitter-detector angles. In contrast to scXRD, PXRD yields a one-\\ndimensional dataset – random orientation of particles within a powder prevents two-\\ndimensional detectors (as in scXRD) from yielding the same amount of information \\nfor each angle of rotation (Figure 6-2). Consequently, while molecular structures may \\nbe calculated from PXRD patterns,[155] it is significantly more difficult to do so. \\nIt is usually easier to produce powders from experiments than single crystals. PXRD \\nmeasurements are usually faster to perform than equivalent scXRD preparations. \\nBecause of this, it is routinely used to measure sample phase during experimental \\npreparations. In Chapter 3, PXRD is used to measure the phase of CC3 during \\nhost-guest exchange processes. In Chapter 2, it is used to measure the crystallinity of \\nsynthetic products. \\nPXRD analyses presented in this thesis are performed as follows: High-quality \\nPXRD data were collected in transmission geometry on a Bruker D8 Advance diffrac-\\ntometer with Ge-monochromated Cu Kα1 radiation and a LynxEye PSD on samples \\nheld between Mylar films. Data were collected in the range 4° ≤ 2\\uf071 ≤ 50° with a step \\nsize of 0.013° over 2 hours. Lower quality HT PXRD data were collected in transmis-\\nsion geometry on a PANalytical X’Pert PRO multi-purpose diffractometer with Cu \\nKα1 radiation. Samples were ground and mounted as loose powder onto the transpar-\\nent film of a 96-well aluminium plate. Data were collected in the range 4° ≤ 2\\uf071 ≤ 50° \\nwith a step size of 0.01° over one hour.  \\nNuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy 95 \\n  \\n \\n6.3 Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy \\nIn NMR, a sample in a deuterated solvent is placed in a magnetic field, irradiated to a \\nhigher energy state with a radio-frequency pulse, and allowed to relax back to the \\nground state while detectors record sample emissions. With further calculations, the \\nmeasurements are used to calculate chemical environments in the sample.  \\nNMR is used in this thesis to measure distinct chemical environments within a sam-\\nple. In Chapter 3, it is used to measure any chemical changes in CC3 during \\nhost-guest exchange processes. In Chapter 2, it is used to measure chemical differ-\\nences between the products and reactants of HT synthetic procedures.  \\nNMR analyses presented in this thesis are performed as follows: Deuterated chlo-\\nroform was pre-treated with either silver foil or 3 Å molecular sieves to remove traces \\nof acid. Deuterated dichloromethane was purchased in sealed ampules and used \\nimmediately. Trimethylsilane is used as an internal standard.  1H NMR spectra were \\nrecorded at 400.13 MHz using a Bruker Avance 400 NMR spectrometer. 13C NMR \\nspectra were recorded at 100.6 MHz. \\n6.4 Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) \\nIn SEM, detectors measure electrons emitted from a solid surface as an electron beam \\nscans over it. The position of the beam is controlled throughout the process so rec-\\norded emissions represent surface properties at specific positions. These \\nmeasurements are commonly used to elucidate the topography of a sample. Modern \\nSEM instruments control the emitted beams position to a great degree of accuracy \\nwhich directly corresponds to topographical accuracy. Measurements with resolu-\\ntions of up to 50 nm are presented here. \\nSEM was used to accurately measure the topography of samples. In Chapter 3, SEM is \\nused to measure morphological changes in CC3 during various stages of host-guest \\nexchange. In Chapter 4, it is used to measure the structure of GC columns containing \\nrac-CC3 nanoparticles. \\nSEM analyses presented in this thesis are performed as follows: Imaging was per-\\nformed using a Hitachi S-4800 cold field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-\\nSEM). Samples were prepared on 15 mm Hitachi M4 aluminium stubs using an adhe-\\nsive high purity carbon tab. The samples were then coated with a 2 nm layer of gold \\nusing an Emitech K550X automated sputter coater. The FE-SEM measurement scale \\n96 Characterization Techniques \\n \\n \\nbar was calibrated using certified SIRA calibration standards. Imaging was conducted \\nat a working distance of 8 mm and a working voltage of 3 kV using a mix of upper \\nand lower secondary electron detectors. \\n6.5 Mass Spectrometry \\nIn mass spectrometry, samples are ionised and deflected through a strong magnetic \\nfield into a detector. The degree to which ions deflect in the field directly corresponds \\nto their mass to charge ratio (m/z) - heavier, less charged, ions deflect less than light-\\ner, highly charged, ones. Mass spectrometers accurately control the magnetic field to \\nscan through a range of m/z’s and record a full mass spectrum. \\nMass spectrometry is used in Chapter 2 to identify a novel organic cage compound. \\nMass spectra presented in this thesis are acquired as follows: Matrix-Assisted Laser \\nDesorption/Ionization Time of Flight Mass Spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) was \\ncarried out using a Shimadzu Biotech Axima Confidence in linear positive ion mode \\nwith dithranol as a matrix. \\n6.6 Fourier-Transform Infra-Red (FTIR) Spectroscopy \\nIn FTIR, infra-red radiation at a range of wavelengths is passed through an experi-\\nmental sample into a detector. In addition, a blank control sample undergoes the \\nsame routine. The difference in recorded intensity between these samples is calculated \\nto yield a spectrum. Within particular wavelength ranges, absorptions are associated \\nwith chemical bonding modes. For example, absorptions between 1600 and 1700 cm-1 \\nmay indicate an imine (C=N) bond.  \\nFTIR is used in this thesis to measure the bonding structure of a sample. In Chapter \\n3, FTIR is used to measure chemical changes in CC3 during host-guest exchange \\nprocesses. In Chapter 2, it is used to measure the presence of any new bonding modes \\nfrom synthetic screens and to characterise a novel organic cage compound. \\nFTIR analyses presented in this thesis are performed as follows: All IR spectra \\nwere collected on a Bruker Tensor 27 spectrometer. Samples were analysed for 32 \\nscans at a resolution of 4 cm-1 using an Attenuated Total Reflection (ATR) cell (Quest \\nATR GS10800, Specac corporation) or using a IR-transparent 96-well silicon plate \\nanalyzer (using a Bruker HTS-XT extension). The recorded wavenumber range was \\n4000-400 cm-1. \\nThermogravimetric Analysis (TGA) 97 \\n  \\n \\n6.7 Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA) \\nIn TGA, the weight of a sample is recorded as it is exposed to increasing tempera-\\ntures. It was used to measure the solvent desorption temperature, guest desorption \\ntemperature, and thermal decomposition temperatures of samples. It is used in Chap-\\nter 3 to measure desorption of guest and solvent from CC3 during host-guest \\nexchange processes. \\nTGA analyses presented in this thesis are performed as follows: Analyses were \\ncarried out using a Q5000IR analyzer (TA instruments) with an automated vertical \\noverhead balance. The samples were heated in air from room temperature to 300 °C \\nat a rate of 10 °C min-1. \\n6.8 Volumetric Adsorption Analysis \\nThis analysis measures the amount of a gas (nitrogen, in this thesis) adsorbed by a \\nsample. As a simplification, the technique presented measures the difference in pres-\\nsure between experimental samples and expected values for the apparatus. It is used \\nin Chapter 2 to measure the (negligible) porosity of a novel organic cage compound.  \\nVolumetric adsorption analyses presented in this thesis are performed as follows: \\nThe sample surface area was tested using B.O.C. high purity nitrogen grade N5 \\n(99.999 %). Surface area was measured by nitrogen adsorption and desorption at 77.3 \\nK using a Quantachrome NOVA 4200e volumetric adsorption analyser.

It is used in Chapter 2 (experiment 7.1.3.6) as part of characterising a novel \\norganic cage compound. \\nElemental analyses presented in this thesis are performed as follows: Analysis was \\ncarried out using a Thermo Flash EA1112 Elemental Analyser. Samples were analysed \\nas dry powders and the resulting data was processed using Eager 300 dedicated ele-\\nmental analysis software.  \\n98 Ex\\n \\n \\n E7\\n7.1 D\\nDiamin\\nchased \\nBenzen\\nanol, N\\npurchas\\nAdditio\\nliteratur\\ntricarba\\nfor use \\nperimen\\n7.1.1 \\nNo spec\\nabout e\\nSection\\nple chro\\nmany e\\ntion and\\nexperim\\n7.1.2 \\nThrough\\nwas per\\ncompou\\nAs a sim\\nappeare\\nshortlis\\n[2+3], [\\ning cage\\nthe fina\\nperimental Me\\nxper\\niscoverin\\nes, dianilin\\nfrom Sigm\\ne-1,3,5-trica\\n,N-dimethy\\ned from Fis\\nnal trialdeh\\ne methods\\nldehyde (L \\nin experim\\nt 7.1.3.4 wa\\nCharacteri\\nialised par\\nquipment a\\n.

Stock solutions stated in this Section were prepared to within 1 % error range \\nusing accurate mass balances, graduated pipettes, and microsryringes. \\n7.1.3.1 The experimental platform was prepared in the following manner \\nIn all automated experiments, vial racks and the appropriate solvent bottles were \\nfitted. Experiments 7.1.3.2, 7.1.3.4, and 7.1.3.5 use HT reactor arrays – double jacketed \\nreactors which allow for temperature and (below ambient) pressure control. Reactor \\narrays are purged by heating to 200 °C under vacuum and back filling with nitrogen. \\nThis process is repeated three to five times. Reactors are cooled to the experimental \\ntemperature. Once all the apparatus is fitted the platforms chassis is filled with nitro-\\ngen for the duration of the experiment.  \\n7.1.3.2 The Automated Synthesis of CC1 and CC3-R  \\nSolutions of benzene-1,3,5-tricarbaldehyde, ethylene diamine, and (1R,2R)-\\ncyclohexane-1,2-diamine in chloroform were each made to a concentration of 20 \\nmmol L-1. These solutions were loaded into the robotic platform. Reactors were then \\ncooled to 0 °C for the duration of the experiment. \\nThe robotic procedure was as follows. The diamine solutions were transferred into \\ntheir respective reaction vessels (V = 18.9 mL). With stirring, the benzene-1,3,5-\\ntricarbaldehyde solution was slowly (12.6 mL at a rate of 0.1 mL min-1) added to each \\nreaction vessel. After addition, the vessels were left stirring and cooled for 18 h fol-\\nlowed by warming to room-temperature. Finally, the reaction mixtures were \\ntransferred into septa-sealed sample vials. 50 μL aliquots were taken for solvent-\\nsuppressed 1H NMR. For comparison, CC1 and CC3-R were also synthesised manual-\\nly using previously described methods.[50,65] \\n7.1.3.3 Investigating Optimal Conditions for a Cage-Forming Reaction Between \\n4,4’-methylenedianiline and Benzene-1,3,5-tricarbaldehyde \\nA schematic of this experiment is available in main text (Figure 2-2, p30). The exper-\\niment focused on the reaction between benzene-1,3,5-tricarbaldehyde (A) and 4,4’-\\nmethylenedianiline (B).  \\n100 Experimental Methods \\n \\n \\nFor each solvent of interest, stock solutions of A (c = 90 mmol L-1); trifluoroacetic \\nacid (c = 1 μL mL-1); and B (at three concentrations: 90, 50, or 10 mmol L-1) were \\nmade. These stocks were filled into sample vials and placed into the robotic platform. \\nReactions were either performed in 40 mL sample vials or 10 mL microwave vials for \\nroom-temperature and raised-temperature experiments respectively. \\nThe robotic procedure was as follows. Varying volumes of the A solutions were added \\nto each reactor and diluted with their respective solvent to concentrations of 10, 50, or \\n90 mmol L-1. After dilution, the total solution volume was 2.8 mL in all reactors. Half \\nof the reactors received 0.1 mL of the trifluoroacetic acid solution while the other half \\nreceived 0.1 mL of their respective solvent. Finally, the 4.2 mL of the applicable B \\nsolution was added to each reactor. The total reaction volume for all samples is 5.1 \\nmL. Room temperature reactors were stirred using a vortex mixer and raised-\\ntemperature reactors were rapidly transferred onto the microwave apparatus after \\naddition. Room-temperature reactions proceeded overnight (c.a. 18 h) while heated \\nreactions proceeded for 3 h. 50 μL aliquots of each sample were taken for solvent-\\nsuppressed 1H NMR analysis (example in main text, Figure 2-2, p30). 40 μL aliquots \\nof each sample were spotted onto a 96-well aluminium plate for FTIR (reflectance) \\nanalysis (representative example in main text, Figure 2-2, p30). \\n7.1.3.4 Investigating Optimal Conditions for a Cage-Forming Reaction between \\nSeveral Diamines and tris([1,1’-biphenyl]-4-carbaldehyde) \\nThis experiment focused on the reaction of tris([1,1’-biphenyl]-4-carbaldehyde) (C in \\nFigure 2-4, p33) with either ethylene diamine (D); (1R,2R)-cyclohexane-1,2-diamine \\n(E); or 2,3-diaminopropane (F). Additionally, the reactant concentration and pres-\\nence of catalyst (trifluoroacetic acid) was also varied. \\nStocks containing the reactants were produced at a concentration of 20 mmol L-1 in \\nchloroform. Additionally, a trifluoroacetic acid stock was made at a concentration of 1 \\nμL mL-1 in chloroform. HT reactor arrays were prepared as outlined in 7.1.3.1. The \\nreactors were cooled to 0 °C for the duration of the experiment and warmed to room \\ntemperature before product transfer into a sample vial. \\nThe screening procedure was as follows. Varying volumes of the C stock were added \\nto each reactor and diluted to concentrations of 2, 10, or 20 mmol L-1 with total vol-\\numes of 6.5, 5.9, or 2.8 mL respectively. Half of the reactors received 0.1 mL the \\nDiscovering Novel Organic Cages 101 \\n  \\n \\ntrifluoroacetic acid solution while the other half received 0.1 mL of solvent. Depend-\\ning on concentration, 0.4, 1.0, or 4.1 mL of the appropriate diamine stock was added \\nat a rate of 0.2 mL min-1 to each reactor with stirring.  The final volume of all reaction \\nmixtures was 7 mL. After addition, the reaction vessels were left cooled and stirring \\nfor 60 h. Samples were transferred from the reaction vessel into sample vials. Images \\nof the resulting products can be found in the Appendix (Figure 10-1, p129). Samples \\nwere dried in a HT rotary evaporator and analysed by 1H NMR, GPC, and FTIR (sili-\\ncon transmission plate). Example results from this experiment can be found in the \\nmain text (Figure 2-4, p33); further examples are in the Appendix (p130). \\n7.1.3.5 Combinatorial Screen between Four Trialdehyde Compounds and Four \\nDiamine Compounds with Varying Catalyst Presence \\nThis experiment focused on sixteen combinations of 1,2-di(1-napthyl)-1,2-\\nethanediamine (G in Figure 2-5, p34),  (11R, 12R)-9,10-ethanoanthracene-11,12-\\ndiamine (H), (3S, 4S)-3,4-diamino-1-benzopyrollidine (I), or p-xylylenediamine (J) \\nwith benzene-1,3,5-tricarbaldehyde (A), tris(4-formylphenyl)amine (K), 2,4,6-\\ntrimethylbenzne-1,3,5-tricarbaldehyde (L), or 2-chlorobenzene-1,3,5-tricarbaldehyde \\n(M). Each combination is attempted both uncatalysed and catalysed by trifluoroacetic \\nacid. \\nStock solutions containing the reactants were prepared at a concentration of 15 mmol \\nL-1 in chloroform. Additionally, a trifluoroacetic acid stock was made at a concentra-\\ntion of 1 μL mL-1 in chloroform. HT reactor arrays were prepared as outlined in 7.1.3.1. \\nThe reactors were cooled to 0 °C for the duration of the experiment and warmed to \\nroom temperature before being transferred into a sample vials. \\nThe screening procedure is as follows. For each reactor, 2 mL of the appropriate trial-\\ndehyde solution was added. Half of the reactors received 0.1 mL of the trifluoroacetic \\nacid solution while the other half received 0.1 mL of solvent. With stirring, 3 mL of \\nthe appropriate diamine solution was slowly added to the appropriate reactor at a rate \\nof 0.1 mL min-1. After addition, the reaction mixtures were left cooled and stirring for \\nc.a. 60 h. Samples were transferred into sample vials. Images of the resulting products \\ncan be found in the Appendix (p131). Vials were dried in parallel on a HT rotary \\nevaporator and the resulting solids were analysed by 1H NMR (CDCl3) and PXRD. \\nExample results from this experiment can be found in the main text (Figure 2-6, p35); \\nfurther examples are found in the Appendix (p132). \\n102 Experimental Methods \\n \\n \\n7.1.3.6 Synthesis, Isolation, and Characterization of a Novel [4+6] Cage \\nCompound, CCX-S, Produced by Imine Condensation of (3S,4S)-3,4-\\nDiamino-1-benzylpyrrolidine with Benzene-1,3,5-Tricarbaldehdye \\nThis experiment focused on the scale-up and isolation of a novel cage compound \\nproduced by the one-pot imine condensation of benzene-1,3,5-tricarbaldehyde (A in \\nFigure 2-5, p34) with (3S, 4S)-3,4-diamino-1-benzylpyrollidine (I). The reaction was \\ninitially performed in experiment 7.1.3.5 and, in order to accurately mimic the condi-\\ntions used on a HT platform, the addition was performed using the Atlas scale-up \\nplatform (Syrris Corporation). \\nWith stirring, a solution of I (670 mg) in chloroform (233 mL) was added at a rate of \\n0.1 mL min-1 to a solution of A (373 mg) in chloroform (153 mL) at room temperature. \\nAfter addition, the reaction mixture was left stirring for 72 h. 1H NMR of the mixture \\nindicated no remaining A. The reaction mixture was observed to be a clear amber \\nsolution. This was concentrated on a rotary evaporator (90 mbar, 20 °C) to an approx-\\nimate volume of 15 mL. With stirring, the resulting clear deep-amber concentrate was \\nslowly (c.a. 1 mL min-1) added to approximately 400 mL of stirred, ice-cooled, metha-\\nnol to yield an off-yellow coloured precipitate. The mixture was mobilised into slurry \\nand filtered through a glass frit. Analysis indicated that the filtrate primarily con-\\ntained unreacted I. The filtered precipitate was dissolved in chloroform, filtered into a \\nclean vessel, and dried by rotary evaporation (130 mBar, 20 °C) to yield a dry granular \\nyellow solid. Further drying was performed (20 mBar, 20 °C) overnight.

CCX-S was dissolved in six \\ndifferent solvents: chloroform; dichloromethane; N,N-dimethylformamide; N-\\nmethylformamide; 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol; or N-methylacetamide at an average con-\\ncentration of 3 mg mL-1. 1.5 mL aliquots of these solutions were filled into 3 mL vials \\nwhich were subsequently capped and pierced. The vials were lowered into larger vials \\ncontaining 3 mL of an antisolvent. Seven antisolvents were attempted: pentane, hex-\\nane, diethyl ether, isopropyl ether, acetonitrile, acetone, or methanol which resulted \\nin 42 (6 × 7) solvent/antisolvent combinations. The combination of 2,2,2-\\ntrifluoroethanol with methanol appeared to produce crystalline solids. Combinations \\ninvolving methanol did appear to ‘pip’ which prompted further solvents to be investi-\\ngated. One further combination, N,N-dimethylacetamide with methanol produced \\nsingle crystals which were of high enough quality for scXRD refinement.  \\n7.2 Organic Cages as Selective Sorbents \\nXylene isomers, mesitylene, bromomesitylene, and racemic guest were purchased \\nfrom Sigma-Aldrich and used as received. 1-tert-Butyl-3,5-dimethylbenzene was \\npurchased from Sigma-Aldrich, purified by vacuum distillation (55 °C, 1.7 mbar), and \\nstored over 4 Å molecular sieves.  Acetonitrile, methanol, ethanol, hexane, and chlo-\\nroform were purchased from Fisher Scientific and used as received.  \\nFinely ground CC3-R, CC3-S, and rac-CC3 were prepared according to methods \\ndescribed previously.[50] A chiral conglomerate of CC3, CC3-R+S, was prepared by \\naccurately weighing equal amounts of solid CC3-R and CC3-S into a vial (average \\nparticle size approx. 0.5–200 μm) followed by gentle shaking to mix the particles. In \\ncontrast to the homochiral and chiral conglomerate cages the average particle size of \\nrac-CC3 was smaller, approximately 0.5–50 μm. \\n7.2.1 Characterization Methods \\n7.2.1.1 Gas Chromatography (GC) \\nGC is the primary technique used in Chapter 3. All GC measurements were carried \\nout on the equipment as described in the characterization Section (6.1.1, p90). GC \\nmethods for any chromatograms shown in the main text can be found in the Appen-\\ndix (p126).  \\n104 Experimental Methods \\n \\n \\n7.2.1.1.1 Selective Adsorption Screening Measurements \\nNon-quantitative screening experiments were used to rapidly identify guest-host \\nsystems for further study. A schematic of this technique is available in the main text \\n(Figure 3-1, p43). In most cases, CC3 was prepared in a headspace vial using the \\ntechnique described in Section 7.2.3.1. A small (< 1 equiv.) amount of guest was added \\nusing a microsyringe and the sample were re-weighed to calculate the number of \\nmoles of guest added. The sample was analysed by GC against a control containing \\nonly guest. The relative peak areas of each component in the guest was analysed and \\ncompared with the control sample. As discussed in the main text, this approach ena-\\nbled identification of selective adsorption but could not be used to calculate the molar \\nuptake, percentage adsorbed, etc. \\n7.2.1.1.2 Quantitative Selective Adsorption Measurements \\nThis technique was used in several experiments: 7.2.3.5, 7.2.3.6, 7.2.3.7, 7.2.3.8 and \\n7.2.3.9. It involved using 1-tert-butyl-3,5-dimethylbenzene as a solvent which is too \\nbig to participate in host-guest exchange mechanisms. Discussion of the development \\nof this technique is found in the main text. Examples of quantitative GC measure-\\nments can be found in the main text (e.g. Figure 3-9, p56) and the Appendix (e.g. \\nFigure 10-14, p139). The technique measures the concentration of guest left in the \\nsolution phase after mixing with CC3. In the project, the technique was developed \\nwith a rac-1-PE guest and CC3 host system. Bromomesitylene was used as an internal \\nstandard. Its concentration does not need to be accurately controlled; however, it does \\nneed to be consistent within an experiment. Usually, base stock solutions of bromo-\\nmesitylene (c ≈ 2 mg mL-1) are made and all stocks, calibrations, etc. are made from it \\nto maintain consistency.  \\nIn each experiment, calibration standards were accurately prepared and analysed by \\nGC. The peak areas for the 1-PE enantiomers (AR/S) and bromomesitylene (ABrMesሻ \\nwere recorded for each calibration standard. The response factor of each enantiomer \\n(fi) was independently calculated (Equation 7-1, from ref. \\n[117]) and plotted against half \\nthe stock concentration (crac\\n2\\n\\t=\\tcR/S). Quadratic fits of these plots yielded a relationship \\nbetween chromatographically measured fi values and sample (R/S)-1-PE concentra-\\ntions. Y-intercepts of the fits were set to fi values measured for blank (c = 0) samples \\nto accommodate for trace impurities present in some solvents. Quadratic fits were \\nused in preference to linear fits due to the large 1-PE concentration range between \\nOrganic Cages as Selective Sorbents 105 \\n  \\n \\nstock solutions and post-adsorption solutions (fitting technique comparison in Ap-\\npendix, p138).  \\n \\n fi(R/S)\\t=\\t AR/SABrMes. Equation 7-1 \\n \\nThe resulting quadratic equation can be used to calculate the concentration of \\n(R/S)-1-PE in samples from their measured peak areas. The difference between the \\nmoles of rac-1-PE added and moles remaining were assumed to be equal to the moles \\nadsorbed into CC3. Values calculated in this manner compared well with values cal-\\nculated from 1H NMR analyses (GC: 1.00, 1H NMR: 0.98 equivalents of 1-PE for a \\nrepresentative sample). \\n7.2.1.2 Other Characterization Methods \\nHPLC measurements were carried out as described in Section 6.1.2 (p91). HPLC was \\nused in two experiments. Firstly, in 7.2.3.10 it is used to measure the solubility of \\nCC3-R in four bulky solvents. Second, in 7.2.3.9 it was used to measure the amount of \\nCC3 dissolved into solution during host-guest exchange. \\nNMR measurements were carried out as described in Section 6.3 (p95). 1H NMR \\nmeasurements were performed in experiment 7.2.3.9 to analyze the chemical state of \\nCC3 during the host-guest exchange process at varying concentrations. It was also \\nused to verify the guest-adsorbed amounts calculated by GC methods. \\nTGA measurements were carried out as described in Section 6.7 (p97). Measure-\\nments were performed in experiment 7.2.3.9 to analyze any changes in the thermal \\nstability of CC3 at several stages of host-guest exchange.  \\nFTIR measurements were carried out as described in Section 6.6 (p96). An ATR cell \\nwas used for measurements. Measurements were performed in experiment 7.2.3.9 to \\nanalyze any chemical changes in CC3 at several stages of host-guest exchange.  \\nSEM imaging was carried out using the equipment described in Section 6.4 (p95). \\nImages were recorded in experiment 7.2.3.9 to view the change in morphology of \\nCC3 (if any) during different stages of host-guest exchange. \\n106 Experimental Methods \\n \\n \\nscXRD was carried out using the equipment described in Section 6.2.1 (p93). Crystal-\\nlisations of CC3-R in the presence of 1-PE were performed to yield a guest-adsorbed \\ncrystal structure that was compared with models. Both the measurements and subse-\\nquent crystallographic calculations were performed by Marc A. Little. The \\nimplementation can be found in the ESI of the related publication.[66] \\nPXRD measurements were carried out using the equipment described in Section \\n6.2.2 (p94). Diffraction patterns were recorded for a variety of CC3 powders obtained \\nfrom experiment 7.2.3.9 including the starting, guest-adsorbed, and guest-desorbed \\nstates of CC3-R, CC3-S, rac-CC3, and CC3-R+S.  \\n7.2.2 Computational Methods \\nComputational modelling was utilised in experiment 7.2.3.9 to elucidate the source of \\nselective adsorption between CC3-R and rac-1-PE. Modelling was performed by \\nLinjiang Chen. This Chapter focuses on measuring selectivity with experimental \\ntechniques and, as such, does not go into depth about the implementation details of \\nthe modelling. However, a full explanation of how the modelling implementation can \\nbe found in the publication related to the experiment.[66]  \\n7.2.3 Experimental Methods \\nFor all experiments, accurate liquid additions were performed with the appropriate \\nmicrosyringe, graduated pipette, or measuring cylinder to achieve addition errors \\nbelow 1 %. Stock solutions were made using volumetric flasks with the same error \\nconstraints. Spot checks on the accuracy of the glassware were performed intermit-\\ntently. All weight measurements were performed on an accurate mass (± 0.05 mg) \\nbalance. This same balance was used in all experiments and is calibrated/re-centered \\nbefore each set of measurements.  \\nMany of these experiments contained a large number of samples and duplicates. Be-\\ncause of this, mean values with standard deviations (σ) are presented to save space \\nbut give an idea of the magnitude of the numbers quoted. \\n7.2.3.1 Activated CC3 samples for use in the following experiments were prepared \\nas followed.  \\nUnless specified otherwise, CC3 was used in a finely ground, dried, form. CC3 is \\nhygroscopic and, consequently, was re-activated in a vacuum oven before use in an \\nexperiment.  \\nOrganic Cages as Selective Sorbents 107 \\n  \\n \\nPre-weighed vials were filled with a known amount of CC3. Samples were placed in a \\nvacuum oven at 60 °C for 4 h followed by raising the temperature to 90 °C overnight \\n(c.a. 18 h). Once cooled, the filled vials were weighed in order to accurately calculate \\nthe moles of CC3 in each vial. \\n7.2.3.2 The selective adsorption of xylene isomers into CC3-R was investigated in \\nthe following manner.  \\nAn isomer mixture of ortho- (34 % w/w), meta- (31 %), and para-xylene (35 %) was \\nmade. Approximately 50 mg of CC3-R was placed into a headspace vial and prepared \\nas in 7.2.3.1. A small droplet of the mixture was added from a glass pipette and the \\nvial was sealed. The sample and the mixture were both analysed by GC and com-\\npared. Measured chromatograms are presented in main text, Figure 3-2 (p44). \\n7.2.3.3 Screening for chirally selective adsorption was achieved in the following \\nmanner.  \\nBatches (> 20) of samples containing CC3-R were prepared as in 7.2.3.1. Small drop-\\nlets of racemic mixtures were spotted onto the samples and mixed. Samples were left \\nfor several hours before analysis. Each sample was analysed by static headspace GC \\nfor deviations from ee = 0. Because the number of different mixtures is large (>50), \\nGC methods were developed iteratively against control samples before use in screen-\\ning experiments. Only racemic (ee = 0 ± 1 %) mixtures with baseline separation were \\nused to measure chiral adsorption. \\n7.2.3.4 The selective adsorption of rac-3-hydroxytetrahydrofuran enantiomers \\ninto CC3 was investigated in the following manner.  \\nCC3-R, CC3-S, and rac-CC3 were placed in headspace vials and prepared as in \\n7.2.3.1. For each sample, a small (< 10 μL) droplet of rac-3-hydroxytetrahydrofuran \\nwas added from a glass pipette and the vial was sealed. Samples and a \\nrac-3-hydroxytetrahydrofuran control were analysed by GC and compared to meas-\\nure selective adsorption. Resulting chromatograms are presented in main text, Figure \\n3-3 (p46). \\n7.2.3.5 The effect of solvent on the exchange between rac-1-phenylethnaol and \\nCC3-R was measured in the following manner.  \\nThe effect of solvent was tested for seven solvents: ethanol; hexane; o-xylene; \\nm-xylene; mesitylene; 3,5-di-tert-butyltoluene; and 1-tert-butyl-3,5-dimethylbenzene. \\nIn each case, CC3-R was prepared as in 7.2.3.1 (w¯ = 38.6 σ 0.5 mg). \\n108 Experimental Methods \\n \\n \\nStock solutions for addition to the CC3-R samples were prepared. Stocks of rac-1-PE \\n(c¯  = 36.5 σ 0.9 μmol mL-1) and bromomesitylene in the solvent of interest were pre-\\npared. These solutions were added to the samples to give an equimolar ratio of \\nrac-1-PE to CC3-R (V¯  = 0.93 σ 0.04 mL). The resulting slurries were stirred for 18 h \\nat room temperature and filtered through a 0.2 μm PTFE syringe filter. The filtrates \\nwere analysed by GC as in 7.2.1.1.2 to measure the ee and amount of rac-1-PE ad-\\nsorbed.  \\nIn most cases, the samples (and calibrations) were sampled as liquid injections. How-\\never, due to its high boiling point, 3,5-di-tert-butyl-toluene had a broad solvent peak. \\nTo rectify this, samples with this solvent were sampled as headspace injections. As the \\ncalibrations are ran in the same manner, this should have no overall effect on the \\nresults. Results are presented in the main text, Figure 3-5 (p48). \\n7.2.3.6 The effect of equilibration temperature between rac-1-PE and CC3-R was \\ninvestigated in the following manner.  \\nFive equilibration temperatures were investigated in duplicate: 40, 55, 60, 75, 90, 105 \\n°C. Ten CC3-R samples were prepared as in 7.2.3.1 (w¯ = 28.7 σ 0.6 mg). To each sam-\\nple, a stock solution of rac-1-PE (36.08 μmol mL-1) and bromomesitylene in 1-tert-\\nbutyl-3,5-dimethylbenzene was added (V¯  = 0.71 σ 0.01 mL) to achieve an equimolar \\nratio of rac-1-PE to CC3-R. The resulting slurry was placed in an incubator at the \\ntemperature of interest for two hours. Static headspace samples were taken directly \\nfrom the incubator for GC analysis. \\nCalibrations were prepared in triplicate. Calibration standards were prepared at rac-1-\\nPE concentrations of 0, 18.04, and 36.08 μmol mL-1 and used to produce a calibration \\ncurve to calculate the amount of (R/S)-1-PE adsorbed into CC3-R. Because headspace \\nconcentration is heavily affected by incubation temperature,[138] independent calibra-\\ntions were taken for each temperature of interest (R2 > 0.98 in all cases). Samples were \\nanalysed as in 7.2.1.1.2 to measure the ee and amount of 1-PE adsorbed. Results are \\npresented in main text, Figure 3-6 (p51). \\n7.2.3.7 The effect of host-guest equilibration time between rac-1-PE and CC3-R was \\ninvestigated in the following manner.  \\nFour equilibration times were investigated in triplicate: 8, 52, 1400, and 2800 minutes. \\nThe stock and calibration solutions from 7.2.3.6 were used in this experiment. Twelve \\nCC3-R samples were prepared as in 7.2.3.1 (w¯ = 25.0 σ 0.5 mg). To each sample, the \\nOrganic Cages as Selective Sorbents 109 \\n  \\n \\nstock solution was added to achieve an equimolar ratio of rac-1-PE to CC3-R (V¯  = \\n0.62 σ 0.01 mL) and stirred for the equilibration time of interest. After stirring, the \\nresulting slurries were filtered through a 0.2 μm PTFE syringe filter. Filtrates and \\ncalibrations were analysed as in 7.2.1.1.2 to measure the ee and amount of 1-PE ad-\\nsorbed.  \\nIt is assumed that any host-guest process is halted after filtration. Therefore, mixing \\ntime is equivalent to the host-guest equilibration time. Results are presented in main \\ntext, Figure 3-6 (p51). \\n7.2.3.8 The effect of guest equivalents on the equilibration between rac-1-PE and \\nCC3-R was investigated in the following manner.  \\nSeven rac-1-PE : CC3-R molar ratios were investigated in duplicate: 8, 4, 2, 1, 0.5, 0.25, \\nand 0.125. Fourteen samples containing CC3-R were prepared as in 7.2.3.1 (w¯ = 29.0 σ \\n0.5 mg). \\nA stock solution of bromomesitylene in 1-tert-butyl-3,5-dimethylbenzene was made. \\nSeven solutions of rac-1-PE in the stock were made at different accurate concentra-\\ntions: 216.19, 108.10, 54.05, 27.02, 13.51, 6.76, and 3.38 μmol L-1. These solutions were \\nused for both the host-guest exchange process and GC calibration. Calibration was \\nperformed as described in 7.2.1.1.2 (R2 = 0.99). The stock solutions were added to the \\nsamples to achieve the molar ratios of interest. After addition, samples were mixed for \\n18 h and filtered through a 0.2 μm PTFE syringe filter. Filtrates and calibrations were \\nanalysed as in 7.2.1.1.2 to measure the ee and amount of 1-PE adsorbed.  \\nEach stock concentration was used to produce a desired guest:host ratio in the addi-\\ntion step; for example, the 216.9 μmol mL-1 solution was used to produce 8:1 \\nguest:host ratio slurries. This means that, for all guest:host equivalents within the \\nexperiment, the overall volume of the slurry did not greatly differ (V¯  = 0.960 σ 0.02 \\nmL). This helped to remove any differences in mixing efficiency between samples and \\nincrease reproducibility of the data. A comparison with the values measured in 7.2.3.9 \\nis available in the Appendix (p138-139). Results are presented in main text, Figure 3-6 \\n(p51). \\n110 Experimental Methods \\n \\n \\n7.2.3.9 A comprehensive study into the selective adsorption of rac-1-PE into \\nseveral forms of CC3 was performed in the following manner.  \\nThe results generated by this experiment were used directly in a Nature Materials \\npublication. [66] Additional studies of the host-guest behaviour of CC3, which are not \\ndiscussed in the main text of this thesis, can be found in the Electronic Supplemen-\\ntary Information (ESI) of that publication. \\nA schematic of this process is available in the main text (Figure 3-8, p55). This exper-\\niment investigated the selective adsorption of rac-1-PE enantiomers into CC3-R; \\nCC3-S; rac-CC3; and CC3-R+S; a chiral conglomerate of CC3-R and CC3-S, at seven \\ndifferent rac-1-PE to CC3 molar ratios. It can be seen as an expanded version of ex-\\nperiment 7.2.3.8; consequently, data-set comparisons are available in the Appendix \\n(p138-139). The ratios investigated were 2, 1.75, 1.5, 1.25, 1, 0.75, 0.5. Each sample was \\nprepared in triplicate for GC analysis with additional samples prepared in parallel for \\nother analyses. GC analysis was used to quantify the uptake of 1-PE into CC3. There \\nare three distinct stages of interest: pre-exchange, post-exchange (guest-adsorbed \\nCC3 and guest-depleted filtrate), and post-removal (guest-removed CC3 and guest-\\nwashout filtrate). The phase, morphology, and chemical composition of CC3 were \\nmeasured by PXRD, scXRD, SEM, 1H NMR, TGA, and FTIR at all stages.  \\nA stock solution of bromomesitylene in 1-tert-butyl-3,5-dimethylbenzene was made. \\nSeven solutions of rac-1-PE in the stock were made at different accurate concentra-\\ntions: 56.67, 49.87, 42.50, 35.70, 28.34, 21.25, and 15.59 μmol mL-1. These were used for \\nboth the host-guest exchange process and for GC calibration. In addition, four lower-\\nconcentration solutions were made by serial dilution for exclusive use in GC calibra-\\ntion: 7.79, 3.90, 1.95, and 0.97 μmol mL-1. Calibration was performed as described in \\n7.2.1.1.2 (R2 = 0.99). \\nCC3 was prepared as in 7.2.3.1 (w¯ = 30.3 σ 0.7 mg). The stock solutions were added to \\nsamples to achieve the molar ratios of interest. After addition, samples were mixed for \\n18 h and filtered through a glass-fiber disc. The filtrates were analysed as in 7.2.1.1.2 to \\nmeasure the ee and amount of 1-PE adsorbed (Figure 3-9, p56, for representative \\nchromatograms). Additionally, HPLC analysis was performed on the filtrates to \\nmeasure the dissolution of CC3 into the exchange mixture (results presented in Fig-\\nure 3-13, p59). These filtrates are referred to as guest-depleted while the filtered solids \\nare referred to as guest-adsorbed CC3. \\nOrganic Cages as Selective Sorbents 111 \\n  \\n \\nAs in 7.2.3.8, each concentration was chosen to produce the desired guest:host ratio \\nin the later experimental steps; for example, the 56.67 μmol mL-1 solution was used to \\nproduce 2:1 guest:host ratio slurries. This means that, for all guest:host equivalents, \\nthe overall slurry volume did not greatly differ (V¯  = 0.95 σ 0.03 mL).  \\n1-PE was removed from guest-adsorbed CC3 by displacement with acetonitrile. 1 mL \\nof acetonitrile was added to guest-adsorbed CC3 solids (a large excess) followed by \\nthe same mixing and filtration procedure to extract the adsorbed 1-PE into the solu-\\ntion phase. The resulting guest-washout filtrates were analysed by GC to calculate the \\nee of 1-PE desorbed from CC3 (Figure 3-10, p56, for representative chromatograms). \\nThe ee values measured in this manner were in-line with predictions from atomistic \\nsimulations (GC: 29 %, simulated: 24–32 %; graphical representation in main text, \\nFigure 3-18, p64) and aligned well with values calculated from the guest-depleted \\nfiltrates (comparison in main text, Figure 3-11, p57). Additionally, HPLC analysis was \\nperformed on the acetonitrile filtrates to measure the dissolution of CC3; however, no \\nCC3 was observed in the resulting chromatogram. \\nAs an alternative to the above technique it was investigated if 1-PE could be removed \\nin a vacuum oven. Guest-adsorbed CC3 was placed in a vacuum oven at 90 °C over-\\nnight and the resulting guest-desorbed CC3 solids were analysed and, compared to \\nguest-washout CC3 samples, no chemical change could be observed (see Appendix, \\np140). \\n7.2.3.10 The solubility of CC3-R in mesitylene; 1-tert-butyl-3,5-dimethyl benzene; \\nand 3,5-di-tert-butyltoluene was investigated in the following manner. \\nExcess CC3-R (w¯ = 20 σ 5 mg) was placed into vials containing (1.5 ± 0.02) mL of \\nmesitylene; 1-tert-butyl-3,5-dimethyl benzene; or 3,5-di-tert-butyltoluene. Samples \\nwere prepared in duplicate. The resulting slurries were stirred for 18 h to reach satura-\\ntion point and filtered through a 0.2 μm PTFE syringe filter. (90 ± 2) μL aliquots of \\nthe filtrates were added to (900 ± 10) μL of methanol to give the final samples for \\nHPLC analysis. Each sample was analysed in duplicate to yield four data points per \\nCC3-R : solvent combination. \\nFive calibration standards were prepared at varying concentrations: 1, 0.5, 0.25, 0.125, \\nand 0.0625 mg mL-1. These standards were analysed in duplicate by HPLC to produce \\n112 Experimental Methods \\n \\n \\na linear calibration curve (R2 = 0.97) which was used to calculate the saturation con-\\ncentration of CC3-R in each analyte sample.  \\nMean saturation values were as follows (standard error in parenthesis): mesitylene = \\n3.31 (0.086); 1-tert-butyl-3,5-dimethylbenzene = 0.67 (0.009); 3,5-di-tert-butyltoluene \\n= 0.04 (0.004) mg mL-1. \\n7.3 Chromatographic Separations with Organic Cages \\nXylene isomers, alkane isomers, dichloromethane, SP-2100, blank intermediate-\\npolarity fused-silica columns (15 m × 0.25 mm, Supelco, Cat. 25760-U), and racemic \\nmixtures were purchased from Sigma Aldrich and used as received. CC3-R was syn-\\nthesised as described previously.[50] A suspension of rac-CC3 nanoparticles in \\ndichloromethane was synthesised as described previously.[50] As a brief summary, two \\n5 mg mL-1 solutions of CC3-R and CC3-S were rapidly combined, with stirring, at -78 \\n°C. The resulting suspension of rac-CC3 nanoparticles was warmed to room tempera-\\nture and used in the preparation of a GC capillary column (7.3.4.3). \\n7.3.1 Characterization Methods \\n7.3.1.1 Gas Chromatography (GC) \\nGC is the primary technique presented in Chapter 4. The instrumentation and setup \\nis described in Section 6.1.1 (p90). No specialised equipment was required to fit the \\ncustom-made CC3 columns discussed in this Chapter. A variety of GC methods were \\nused to produce the chromatograms presented in the main text, a summary of all \\nmethods can be found in the Appendix (p126).  \\n7.3.1.2 Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) \\nSEM was used to image the GC column and control columns produced in experiment \\n7.3.4.3. Instrumentation and setup is described in Section 6.4 (p95). In each case, a \\nspecialised SEM stub containing a clamp was used to help mount GC capillaries ver-\\ntically. GC columns were carefully cut with a ceramic column cutter to give a \\nrelatively clean break. Small pieces of double-sided graphite tape were placed on the \\ninner edge of the clamp and the small (c.a. 1 cm) cuttings were mounted vertically \\nand clamped.  \\n7.3.2 Computational Methods \\nComputational simulations were carried out by Linjiang Chen. A full explanation of \\nthe methodology, written by Linjiang, is available in the Appendix (10.4.1).  \\nChromatographic Separations with Organic Cages 113 \\n  \\n \\n7.3.3 Association thermodynamics from Van‘t Hoff relationships \\nEquation 7-3 was used to calculate association enthalpies from column elution. It is \\nderived from the Van’t Hoff equation (Equation 7-2) by substitution of the equilibri-\\num constant with the retention factor/phase ratio relationship (Equation 7-4).[117] \\n -RT ln K \\t=\\tΔH0-TΔS0 Equation 7-2 \\nRearrange ln K \\t=\\t- ΔH\\n0\\nRT \\t+\\t\\nΔS0\\nR  \\n \\nSubstitute \\nEquation 7-4 ln kβ \\t=\\t-\\nΔH0\\nRT \\t+\\t\\nΔS0\\nR  \\n \\nRearrange ln k \\t=\\t- ΔH\\n0\\nRT \\t+\\t\\nΔS0\\nR - ln β \\nEquation 7-3 \\n   \\nRelationships Used: \\n k\\t=\\t t‐-t0t0   \\n β = \\ndc\\n4df\\n  \\n K\\t=\\tkβ Equation 7-4 \\n \\nWhere R is the gas constant, T is the absolute temperature, K is the equilibrium con-\\nstant for association, ΔH0 is the standard enthalpy of association, ΔS0 is the standard \\nentropy change of association, k is the retention factor, t is the retention time of the \\nanalyte, t0 is the retention time of an un-retained compound on the column, β is the \\nphase ratio, dc is the column’s internal diameter (ID), and df is the film thickness of \\nthe stationary phase.  \\nBased on these relationships, a plot of ln k against 1 T⁄  should be linear with a gradi-\\nent of ΔH0 R⁄   and an intercept of ൫ΔS0 R⁄ ൯\\t-\\t ln β. Experimentally, a series of \\nseparations with controlled isothermal GC oven methods were performed. These \\nyielded ݇ values for each temperature of interest. From these measurements, ΔH0 was \\ncalculated from the gradient. To calculate ΔS0 from the intercept, the phase ratio \\nmust be known. It was calculated using Equation 7-5 from a literature source.[117] \\n114 Experimental Methods \\n \\n \\n df\\t=\\t2.5 ×\\tdc\\t×\\t(% conc. of coating soln) Equation 7-5 \\n \\nFor the CC3-R coated column, based on a coating solution of 3 mg mL-1 and a \\n0.25 mm ID column, the phase ratio was calculated to be 1333.3. For the rac-CC3 \\nparticle-coated column, based on a coating solution of 1 mg mL-1 and 0.25 mm ID \\ncolumn, the phase ratio was calculated to be 4000. In the latter case, the effect of \\nSP-2100 on the phase ratio is assumed to be minimal because it has no effect on the \\nseparation and does not significantly decrease the columns ID. Thermodynamic val-\\nues calculated using these relationships are presented in the main text (p70 & p82). \\n7.3.4 Experimental Methods \\n7.3.4.1 Producing a GC Column \\nPrototype GC columns produced in this Chapter were made with the static coating \\ntechnique.[117] A blank intermediate-polarity fused-silica capillary column was cut \\nopen at both ends. One end of the column was immersed into the loading mixture \\nwhile the other end was exposed to a vacuum to pull the solution through. Once \\ndroplets were observed at the vacuumed end, the vacuum was released and one end \\nof the column was flame sealed closed. The column was immersed in a water bath set \\nto 30 °C and its open end was exposed to a vacuum to begin the removal of volatile \\nsolvent. Finished columns were conditioned on the gas chromatograph by heating to \\n40 °C for 20 min, raising the temperature to 180 °C at 10 °C min-1, and maintaining \\nthat temperature for a further 30 min under a 1 mL min-1 helium flow. \\n7.3.4.2 The Preparation of a GC Column Containing a Coating of CC3-R \\nTwo columns containing a solid coating of CC3-R were produced as described in \\nSection 7.3.4.1. The loading solutions for each column contained different amounts of \\nCC3-R in dichloromethane (3 mg mL-1 or 6 mg mL-1). Both were filtered through a \\n0.2 μm PTFE syringe filter before loading. A comparison between the two resulting \\ncolumns can be found in the main text (Figure 4-1, p70). Chiral separations in the \\nmain text were performed on the column produced from the 3 mg mL-1 loading solu-\\ntion. \\nChromatographic Separations with Organic Cages 115 \\n  \\n \\n7.3.4.3 The Preparation of a GC Column Containing a Coating of rac-CC3 \\nNanoparticles \\nA 5 mg mL-1 suspension of rac-CC3 nanoparticles was prepared as previously de-\\nscribed.[50] The suspension was diluted to 1 mg mL-1 with dichloromethane. SP-2100 \\nwas added until its concentration was 2.5 mg mL-1. The resulting loading mixture was \\nused to produce a GC column as described in 7.3.4.1. This column was used to sepa-\\nrate a variety of achiral mixtures described in the main text (e.g. linear alkanes, Figure \\n4-2, p71). Cuttings of this column were taken for SEM analysis as described in 7.3.1.2. \\n7.3.4.4 Investigating Separations with CC3 GC Columns \\nThe CC3 GC columns produced were a standard fused-silica capillary format. As a \\nresult of this, they required no special handling and were fitted as normal. Mixtures \\nwere placed into a GC headspace vial and static headspace samples were taken as \\ndescribed in 7.3.1.1. No solvent was used in these separations. Discussion around the \\nresulting separations can be found in the main text. GC methods available in Appen-\\ndix (p126). \\n7.3.4.5 Investigating CC3 GC Column Durability \\nBoth the CC3-R column (3 mg mL-1) and rac-CC3 nanoparticle columns’ durability \\nwere tested in the following manner. For the CC3-R column, \\nrac-3-hydroxytetrahydrofuran was placed into a headspace vial and eluted through \\nthe column 36 times (results presented in main text, Figure 4-13, p83). For the \\nrac-CC3 column, a hexane isomer mixture was placed into a headspace vial and elut-\\ned through the column 50 times (results presented in main text, Figure 4-14, p84). As \\na general observation, no change in selectivity or retention was observed for either \\nduring their use (>400 injections). \\n7.3.4.6 The Preparation of a GC Column Containing a Coating of CCX-S  \\nCCX-S was prepared as described in Section 7.1.3.6 (p102). A 2 mg mL-1 solution of \\nCCX-S in dichloromethane was made and filtered through a 0.2 μm PTFE syringe \\nfilter. This loading mixture was used to produce a GC column as described in 7.3.4.1. \\nThe resulting column was found to retain racemic mixtures but was unable to per-\\nform chiral separations (see Appendix p143). \\n  \\n116 Re\\n \\n \\n R8\\n[1] T\\ns\\n[2] J.\\n[3] Z\\n[4] R\\nQ\\nv\\n[5] R\\nS\\n[6] C\\n5\\n[7] K\\n[8] A\\n[9] R\\nC\\n[10] R\\n[11] N\\n9\\n[12] D\\n6\\n[13] A\\n[14] M\\n[15] S\\n[16] A\\nY\\n[17] T\\n[18] S\\n[19] A\\n[20] X\\n[21] K\\n2\\n[22] S\\n[23] N\\n[24] T\\n[25] G\\n[26] M\\n[27] S\\n[28] J.\\nferences \\nefere\\n.

This includes demonstrating practical techniques to undergraduates as \\npart of my PhD placement, visiting local secondary schools to demonstrate spec-\\ntroscopic techniques, and attempting (sometimes successfully!) to inspire visiting \\nsixth-form students to get excited about chemistry \\n\\uf0b7 Experienced with computers. Ever since I managed to create a minigun rocket \\nlauncher in DOOM 2, I have maintained a sustained interest in software devel-\\nopment and design. This includes PHP, Haskell, python, C++, and java but I \\nspend most of my time developing websites with ruby on rails, HTML5, javas-\\ncript, and CSS at the moment. Additionally, I have spent an extensive amount of \\ntime (>2000 h) mastering client-side C# and F# (WPF UI with MVVM architec-\\nture). I am comfortable with procedural, object oriented, and functional \\nprogramming styles \\n\\uf0b7 Experience in design. Specifically, I have used Blender and the Adobe creative \\nsuite (mainly Photoshop and Illustrator) to create a variety of designs, see the \\nstart of this thesis and my LinkedIn profile for examples \\nAchievements \\n\\uf0b7 Designed and developed several elaborate analytical experiments which involved \\nthe careful analysis of hundreds of samples.

Quadratic fits are a common method of correcting for detector non-linearity; \\nconsequently, GC calibration fits for the presented selective adsorption experiments used this ap-\\nproach.  \\n \\n0.5 1 2 4 8\\n-61\\n0\\n58\\nCC3-R+S\\nrac-CC3\\nCC3-S\\neeR\\nrac-1-PE : CC3-R (equiv.)\\nCC3-R\\n \\n \\nFigure 10-12 | Inter-experimental comparison of measured enantiomeric excesses.

These simulations were carried out \\nby Dr. Linjiang Chen, who has written a detailed explanation of the process, cop-\\nied into this Section. \\n10.4.1.1 Configurational-Bias Monte Carlo Simulations of the Adsorption of Hexane \\nIsomers in rac-CC3 \\nConfigurational-bias Monte Carlo (CBMC) simulations of adsorption were used to \\nhelp reveal the underlying principles which give rise to the impressive performance of \\nrac-CC3 in the separation of hexane isomers. Instead of attempting to insert an ad-\\nsorbate molecule as a whole, which conventional MC does, CBMC grows the \\nmolecule segment-by-segment so that energetically unfavourable configurations—for \\nexample, where the molecule overlaps with the host and/or other guests—are largely \\navoided. The input of a CBMC simulation includes the temperature and chemical \\npotential of the gas molecules in the reservoir (the grand-canonical ensemble), and \\nthe output of the simulation include the average number of adsorbed molecules and \\nvarious sorts of information on adsorption (e.g., adsorption enthalpies, adsorbate \\nlocations, etc.). A CBMC simulation is analogous to an adsorption experiment, in \\nwhich the temperature and bulk pressure of a gas are specified and the corresponding \\nuptake is measured. The chemical potential, as used in simulations, can be related to \\nthe gas-phase pressure, as specified in experiments, by an equation of state. The \\nPeng–Robinson equation was used here. The CBMC simulations performed in this \\nwork included a 500,000-cycle equilibration period and a 500,000-cycle production \\nrun. One cycle consisted of n MC steps, with n being equal to the number of adsorb-\\nate molecules (i.e., n fluctuated during the simulation). The trial MC moves included \\nconfigurational-biased insertion, deletion, translation, rotation, and full/partial rein-\\nsertion; these moves were randomly attempted with equal probabilities. The isosteric \\nheats of adsorption at zero coverage (infinite dilution) were obtained from MC simu-\\nlations in the NVT (constant number of particles, volume, and temperature) \\nensemble using the Widom test particle method. Details on the simulation method-\\nologies can be found in the literature.[159–161]  \\nThe atomistic representation of the rac-CC3 crystal structure was constructed from \\nthe experimental crystallographic data, with all the cage atoms kept fixed at their \\n152 Appendix \\n \\nThis Section was written entirely by Dr. Linjiang Chen.

A 1 × 1 × 1 unit-cell representation of the rac-CC3 \\ncrystal structure was used in the CBMC simulations with periodic boundary condi-\\ntions exerted in three dimensions. Lennard–Jones (LJ) parameters for rac-CC3 were \\ntaken from the OPLS-AA force field.[162] The hexane isomers were described by the \\nso-called united atom model, in which CH3, CH2, and CH are considered single enti-\\nties; i.e., a carbon atom and all of its bonded hydrogen atoms are lumped together to \\nform one interaction site (a bead). Two neighbouring beads were connected by a \\nharmonic bonding potential. A harmonic bending potential described the bond \\nbending between three neighbouring beads, and changes in the torsional angle were \\ncontrolled by a three-cosine potential. The beads in a chain separated by more than \\nthree bonds interacted with each other through a LJ potential. The force-field param-\\neters used for hexane were taken from TraPPE,[163,164] while a detailed description of its \\napplication to adsorption simulations of nanoporous materials can be found in Dub-\\nbeldam et al.[163] The Lorentz–Berthelot combining rules were used to calculate both \\nhost–guest and guest–guest LJ cross-parameters, and a real-space cutoff of 12.0 Å was \\napplied to all LJ interactions.  \\n10.4.1.2 4.2 Molecular Dynamics Simulations of the Diffusion of Hexane Isomers in \\nrac-CC3 \\nA molecular dynamics (MD) simulation mimics the natural pathway of molecular \\nmotion to sample successive configurations, following the classical Newtonian me-\\nchanics, which thereby yields a trajectory that describes the positions, velocities, and \\naccelerations of the particles as they evolve in time. Here, an initial configuration of \\nthe system was created by randomly placing one molecule of the desired hexane iso-\\nmer into the simulation box consisting of one unit cell of the rac-CC3 crystal \\nstructure. The adsorbate position was then equilibrated using 100,000 MC cycles with \\ntranslation, rotation, and reinsertion moves. Next, velocities were assigned according \\nto the Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution and an MD equilibration was run for 5 ns, \\nwith a time step of 0.5 fs, in the isothermal–isobaric (NPT) ensemble. The NPT MD \\nsimulation was continued for ca. 15 ns for production of results. In all the MD simula-\\ntions, both the hexane isomers and the rac-CC3 host were modelled as flexible. \\nAgain, the hexane isomers were described by the TraPPE force field and rac-CC3 by \\nthe OPLS-AA force field. A cut-off radius of 12.0 Å was used for all LJ interactions, \\nwhile all Coulomb interactions were computed using the Ewald summation tech-\\nnique with a relative precision of 10-6. The Lorentz–Berthelot combining rules were \\nChromatographic Separations with Organic Cages 153 \\n  \\nThis Section was written entirely by Dr. Linjiang Chen.

All MD and MC simulations were performed with the \\nRASPA code developed by D. Dubbeldam, S. Calero, D. E. Ellis, and R. Q. Snurr.  \\n10.4.1.3 Hexane Interactions with a CC3 ‘Surface’ \\nWhen considering the perfect, static rac-CC3 crystal structure, CBMC simulations \\npredicted that 2,2-dimethylbutane (2,2-DMB) binds more strongly in the host than \\n2,3-dimethylbutane (2,3-DMB) does, hence suggesting that the latter would elute first \\nin a GC experiment. This contradicts the experimental elution order of a hexane \\nmixture from the rac-CC3 column (Figure 2, main text). On the other hand, MD \\nsimulations, taking into account internal flexibility of the CC3 cages, indicated that \\n2,2-DMB and 2,3-DMB have almost equivalent diffusivities within the rac-CC3 struc-\\nture. Since both di-branched isomers were suggested to be the slowest diffusing \\nspecies, it would therefore seem reasonable to expect them to diffuse least-extensively \\nwithin the particles of rac-CC3 before exiting. It therefore follows that the relative \\ninteraction strengths of 2,3-DMB and 2,3-DMB with the surface of rac-CC3 particles \\nmight contribute more significantly to their elution sequence compared to the less-\\nbranched isomers, which diffuse more extensively.  \\nTo explore this hypothesis, we created in-silico a ‘surface’ of CC3, as shown in Figure \\n10-31a. In this CC3 surface, the cages maintain the same window-to-window packing \\nand R–S chirality pairing as they do in the rac-CC3 crystal structure, with the up-\\npermost layer of CC3 cages having a window facing upward. The surface was \\nreplicated infinitely in the x–y plane by periodic boundary conditions. In order to \\nexamine the extreme situation when hexane isomers only interact with the outermost \\nregion of rac-CC3 particles, any void space below the surface defined by the centres \\nof mass of the uppermost cages was blocked to adsorption. We calculated zero-\\ncoverage heats of adsorption for all five hexane isomers on this artificial surface mod-\\nel and compared the results with those obtained for the bulk rac-CC3 crystal \\nstructure and with those obtained by experiment (Figure 10-31b).  \\nAlthough 2,2-DMB was again predicted to have a stronger binding affinity with the \\nrac-CC3 crystal structure than 2,3-DMB does at infinite dilution, the CC3 surface \\nwas predicted to interact more strongly with 2,3-DMB than with 2,2-DMB.

While a diverse range of microporous materials have been identified, this thesis focuses on porous organic cages (POCs) because they have received much attention as synthetically tunable, solution processable, microporous materials. After introducing the latest developments in POC synthesis and the general application of microporous materials as selective sorbents, this thesis presents three developments in organic cage chemistry: a high-throughput workflow for the discovery of POCs, which yielded a novel organic cage compound; the measurement of selective adsorption by POCs, wherein the first instance of chiral selectivity by a POC was recorded; and the first instance of applying POCs as stationary phases for gas chromatography, which produced columns that separate racemic mixtures, alkylaromatic isomers, and alkane isomers. Chapter 2, discovering novel organic cages, presents attempts to use high-throughput and in-silico techniques to accelerate the discovery of novel organic cages. These methods were utilised to isolate a novel organic cage, CCX-S, which is characterised and discussed. Chapter 3, organic cages as selective sorbents, presents the development of approaches for measuring selective adsorption. These methods were used to identify the first reported instance of enantioselective adsorption by an organic cage. Further measurements to explain this separation behavior are also presented. Chapter 4, chromatographic separations with organic cages, presents one method of practically leveraging the presented separation behavior. In Chapter 4, the coating of capillary columns with CC3 is presented. These columns were used to successfully perform gas chromatographic separations, the first recorded instance of using a POC to do so. The columns were further improved by modifying the coating method and using prefabricated CC3 nanoparticles. This modification enabled difficult separations to be performed using the column; for example, the separation of hexane’s five isomers.</dc:description><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>http://livrepository.liverpool.ac.uk/2010659/1/KewleyAda_Nov2014_2010659.pdf</dc:identifier><dc:language>en</dc:language><dc:subject>Q1</dc:subject><dc:subject>QD</dc:subject><dc:subject>TP</dc:subject><dc:title>The synthesis and separation properties of organic cage compounds</dc:title><rioxxterms:author>Kewley, Adam</rioxxterms:author><rioxxterms:type>other</rioxxterms:type><rioxxterms:version>NA</rioxxterms:version></rioxx></metadata></record>',\n",

Measurement of sedimentation rate was conducted every month during the process of cultivation lobster. This measurement was done by setting up a sediment trap under and around the cage. The result of this study showed that sedimentation rate under the lobster cage within 270 days ranged from 14.92 to 27.33 (20.66±4.60) g/m2/day. The organic waste did not disperse far away from the cage because of the small current rate around the cage location of 0.068 to 0.2 m/s. Feces and residual feed settling velocities followed the current direction within the range of 0.0373 to 0.072 m/s with 8.50 m of water depth. According to this result,  dispersion of feces particle and residual food was between 8.24 and 45.58 m from the cage. In order to prevent an accumulation of waste particle on the water bottom, the distance between cages needs to be set to at least twice of the farthest distance of particle dispersion which is 2 x 45.58 = 91.16 m or about 100 m.

Hasil penelitian menunjukkan bahwa laju sedimentasi di \\nbawah KJA pada  budidaya udang karang selama 270 hari berkisar antara  14,92-27,33 (20,66±4,60) g/m2/hari. \\nLimbah organik budidaya udang karang tidak menyebar jauh dari lokasi KJA, karena arus laut hanya berkisar \\nantara 0,068-0,2 m/dt. Kecepatan pengendapan feses dan sisa pakan berkisar antara 0,0373 – 0,072 m/dt dengan \\nkedalaman perairan 8,50 m, maka diperoleh penyebaran partikel feses dan sisa pakan mencapai jarak antara \\n8,24-45,58 m dari KJA. Berdasarkan penyebaran limbah organik dari KJA di dasar perairan, maka untuk \\nmenghindari penumpukan partikel limbah di dasar KJA, maka tata letak antar unit KJA harus berjarak minimal \\n2 kali jarak terjauh penyebaran partikel (2 x 45,58 = 91,16 m) atau dibuatkan menjadi  sekitar 100 m. \\n \\nKata kunci: laju sedimentasi, dispersi limbah, budidaya udang karang, Teluk Ekas \\n \\nI. PENDAHULUAN \\n \\nUdang karang atau lobster (Spiny \\nlobster) termasuk komoditi perikanan yang \\nmempunyai peranan penting sebagai komodi-\\ntas ekspor dari jenis krustasea setelah udang \\nPenaeid.  Udang ini diperdagangkan dalam \\nkeadaan hidup, dengan harga jual yang  terus \\nmelambung, karena permintaan akan komo-\\nditas ini di pasar global terus meningkat \\nsetiap tahun (Holmyard and  Franz, 2006; \\nSolanki et al., 2012). Pada tahun 2014, eks-\\npor udang karang tercatat US$ 42,8 juta de-\\nngan volume 3.427 ton, dengan negara tujuan \\nLaju Sedimentasi dan Dispersi Limbah Organik Budidaya Udang  Karang  dalam . . . \\n288                                                        http://itk.fpik.ipb.ac.id/ej_itkt71 \\nutama adalah Tiongkok dan Taiwan (BII, \\n2015).  \\nTingginya harga jual telah mendo-\\nrong perkembangan  budidaya udang karang \\nakhir-akhir, dan akibat penurunan hasil tang-\\nkapan di alam (Jones et al., 2010; Jones, \\n2010). Sejak tahun 2000 di Teluk Ekas, Pro-\\nvinsi Nusa Tenggara Barat berkembang budi-\\ndaya udang karang dalam keramba jaring \\napung (KJA). Pada waktu itu banyak ditemu-\\nkan benih alam yang  menempel pada pelam-\\npung dan material lain yang berkaitan dengan \\nbudidaya rumput laut dan kerapu (Priyam-\\nbodo and Sarifin, 2009), kemudian benih-\\nbenih tersebut diambil dan dipelihara dalam \\nKJA, sehingga kegiatan budidaya udang ka-\\nrang  terus berkembang sampai saat ini. \\nPerkembangan kegiatan budidaya di \\nwilayah pesisir dan laut dalam dua dekade \\nterakhir telah memicu perhatian banyak kala-\\nngan akibat dampak lingkungan yang ditim-\\nbulkannya (Mazzola et al., 2000;  Olsen and \\nOlsen, 2008). Meningkatnya budidaya ikan \\nsistem KJA berpotensi sebagai sumber ma-\\nsukkan  bahan organik dalam kolom dan da-\\nsar perairan, baik dalam bentuk padatan mau-\\npun tersuspensi (Shakouri, 2003). Limbah \\nbudidaya yang terlarut dan tersuspensi dalam \\nair dari sisa metabolik dan hasil ekskresi bio-\\nta budidaya tersebar ke kolom perairan oleh \\narus. Limbah padat berupa pakan yang tidak \\ntermakan dan feses tersebar dalam kolom \\nperairan dan terakumulasi di dasar perairan \\nsehingga berdampak pada lingkungan bentik \\n(Nash, 2001; Shakouri, 2003; Caroll et al., \\n2003). Selama sedimentasi, sebagian feses \\ndan sisa pakan tersebut dimangsa oleh orga-\\nnisme bukan budidaya sebelum mencapai \\ndasar perairan (Beveridge, 1996), sedangkan \\nsebahagian lagi pecah menjadi partikel halus \\ndan mengalami pelarutan serta cenderung \\nmeningkatkan turbiditas di sekitar lokasi bu-\\ndidaya (Silvert and Sowles, 1996). \\nDeposit limbah organik diperkirakan \\nmencapai 3 kg/m2/tahun di sekitar KJA, se-\\nmentara di bawah KJA mencapai 10 kg/m2/ \\ntahun (Gowen and Brandy, 1987 dalam Wu,  \\n1995). Sedimen dasar perairan di bawah KJA \\nyang mengalami perubahan fisika dan kimia \\ntidak lebih dari 50 m dari KJA (Morrisey et \\nal., 2000), sementara McGhie et al. (2000) \\nmenyebutkan sebaran beban limbah organik \\nmenjadi jarak 20 dari pusat KJA, dan pemu-\\nsatan sedimen dapat menutupi dasar perairan \\nmencapai jarak 30 m dari KJA (Rachman-\\nsyah, 2004).  Beban limbah budidaya ikan, \\nditambah limbah berbagai sumber lain dari \\ndaratan yang masuk ke perairan teluk ber-\\nkaitan dengan daya dukung untuk pengem-\\nbangan budidaya laut (Scholl et al., 2012).  \\nMenurut Krisanti dan Imran (2006),  kapasi-\\ntas asimilasi limbah perairan Teluk Ekas ter-\\nutama kadar amonia dan nitrat tidak lagi \\nmendukung untuk pengembangan kegiatan \\nbudidaya laut, kecuali dilakukan pengaturan \\ntata letak dan jarak antara unit KJA serta pem-\\nbatasan jumlah KJA yang boleh beroperasi. \\n Limbah partikel organik yang ber-\\nasal dari KJA secara nyata berpengaruh ter-\\nhadap lingkungan bentik (Mazzola et al., \\n2000). Ruiz et al. (2001) melaporkan bahwa \\nloading yang berasal dari budidaya ikan (30 \\nKJA pada luasan 7 ha dan kedalaman 20 m) \\nakan berdampak pada hilangnya padang la-\\nmun (Posidonia oceanica) seluas 11,29 ha. \\nDampak lain limbah budidaya ini adalah \\nterjadinya penurunan keanekaragaman in-\\nfauna dalam sedimen dan degradasi dasar \\nperairan, jika limbah menghasilkan deposit C \\norganik melebihi 0,7 kgC/m2/tahun (Gilli-\\nbrand et al., 2002).  Informasi mengenai laju \\nsedimentasi dan dispersi limbah organik pen-\\nting untuk diketahui dan bagaimana  sebaran \\nsedimen di sekitar KJA, apakah mengikuti \\npola arus atau tidak. Informasi tersebut dapat \\ndigunakan sebagai acuan dalam pengelolaan \\nbudidaya laut secara berkelanjutan terutama  \\nuntuk menentukan tata letak antar unit KJA.  \\nOleh karena, dilakukan penelitian  ini bertu-\\njuan untuk mengetahui laju sedimentasi dan \\ndispersi limbah organik budidaya udang ka-\\nrang dalam KJA di  perairan Teluk Ekas Pro-\\nvinsi Nusa Tenggara Barat. \\n \\n \\nJunaidi dan Hamzah \\n                  Jurnal Ilmu dan Teknologi Kelautan Tropis, Vol. 7, No. 1, Juni 2015                        289 \\nII. METODE PENELITIAN \\n \\n2.1. Wilayah Studi \\nTeluk Ekas terletak di sebelah sela-\\ntan Pulau Lombok, Provinsi Nusa Tenggara \\nBarat (Gambar 1).  Posisinya membujur dari \\nutara ke selatan, dengan letak geografis \\nantara 8o49’15”-8o55’0” LS dan 116o23’0”-\\n116o28’45” BT. Teluk Ekas berhadapan  \\nlangsung dengan Samudera Hindia, dan ber-\\ndekatan dengan Selat Alas yang menghu-\\nbungkan massa air dari Samudra Hindia \\ndengan Samudra Pasifik sehingga teluk ini \\nmenampung banyak suplai nutrien sehingga \\nberpotensi sebagai kawasan pengembangan \\nbudidaya laut (BRKP, 2004).  \\n \\n2.2. Budidaya Udang Karang dalam KJA \\nBudidaya udang karang dilakukan \\ndalam karamba  jaring apung (KJA) ukuran  \\n3 x 3 x 3 m3 sebanyak 3 unit yang  diletakkan \\ndalam satu unit rakit. KJA ditempatkan lo-\\nkasi dengan kedalaman perairan sekitar 8,5 \\nm. Benih udang karang jenis Panulirus \\nhomarus yang berukuran 15, 30, dan 45  \\ng/ekor diperoleh dari tempat pengumpulan di \\nsekitar  lokasi budidaya. Sebelum ditebar di-\\nlakukan proses adaptasi terhadap pakan dan \\nlingkungan budidaya selama seminggu. Pa-\\ndat penebaran adalah 150 ekor/KJA. Selama \\nmasa pemeliharaan yang berlangsung selama \\n270 hari (9 bulan),  diberi pakan berupa ikan \\nrucah (segar). Jumlah pakan yang diberikan \\nadalah 5% dari biomassa ikan setiap hari \\ndengan pemberian 1 kali sehari pada jam \\n17.00. Selama pemeliharaan udang karang \\ndilakukan pengukuran kecepatan arus dengan \\nfloater di sekitar KJA, dengan mengukur \\nwaktu tempuh pelampung menempuh jarak \\ntertentu.\\n \\n \\n \\nGambar 1.

Pendugaan Laju Sedimentasi \\nPengukuran laju pengendapan sedi-\\nmen selama pemeliharaan udang karang seti-\\nap bulan  di sekitar KJA, dilakukan dengan \\nmemasang perangkap sedimen (sediment \\ntrap) yang terbuat dari pipa paralon diameter \\n10,16 cm (4 inchi) dan panjang 50 cm, \\ndipasang dibawah KJA, pada jarak 50 m \\n(N50) dan 100 m (N100) ke arah utara, pada \\njarak 50 m (E50) dan 100 m (E100) ke arah \\ntimur, pada jarak 50 m (S50) dan 100 m \\n(E100) ke arah timur, pada jarak 50 m (S50) \\ndan 100 m (S100) ke arah selatan, dan pada \\njarak 50 m (W50) dan 100 m (W100) ke arah \\nbarat (Gambar 1). Perangkap dipasang pada \\nkedalaman 50 cm dari dasar perairan. Sampel \\nsedimen yang terperangkap tersebut bersum-\\nber dari limbah budidaya dan bukan budida-\\nya, dimana dalam penelitian ini kedua sedi-\\nmen tersebut tidak dipisahkan. Koleksi sedi-\\nmen dilakukan setiap bulan, sampel sedimen \\ndikeringkan dalam oven pada suhu 60 oC se-\\nlama 24 jam (English et al.,  1997), kemu-\\ndian dianalisis kadar air dan ditimbang bo-\\nbotnya. Laju sedimentasi dihitung dengan \\npersamaan (Lunusu dan Fitri, 2008) sebagai \\nberikut : \\n \\nLaju sedimentasi (g/m2/hari)=(Bks/Ap)/t  (1) \\n \\ndimana Bks= bobot kering sedimen (g), Ap= \\nluas penampang paralon (m2) dan t= periode \\nkoleksi sedimen (hari). \\n \\n2.4. Pengujian  Kecepatan Pengendapan \\nFeses dan Sisa Pakan \\nPengujian kecepatan pengendapan \\n(settling velocity) feses dan sisa pakan dila-\\nkukan dengan  mengacu pada metode yang \\ndikemukakan oleh Elbenzon and Kelly \\n(1998) dengan asumsi bahwa limbah partikel \\npakan yang  tidak dimakan dan feses akan \\nbergerak secara vertikel sampai kedasar ka-\\nrena tidak dipengaruhi oleh arus, dan nilai \\nkecepatan pengendapan partikel ini diguna-\\nkan untuk pendugaan model dispersi dan luas \\ndampak dampak limbah budidaya. Wadah \\npercobaan berupa akuarium kaca berukuran \\n20 x 20 cm2 dengan tinggi 125 cm dan \\ndilengkapi dengan mistar yang ditempelkan \\ndi bagian dinding akuarium. Akuarium diisi \\nair laut, bersalinitas 35 ppt yang telah disa-\\nring dengan filter bag, setinggi 120 cm. Pada  \\nbagian bawah akuarium setinggi 20 cm dari \\ndasar, diberi tanda sebagai kolom pengen-\\ndapan (untuk mengurangi tekanan permu-\\nkaan), sekaligus sebagai batas kedalaman air \\n100 cm dan permukaan. \\nFeses kering dikoleksi dengan cara \\nmenampung di bagian bawah KJA, kemudian \\ndikeringkan dan digerus serta diayak dengan \\nsaringan berukuran mata 0,5 mm. Sebanyak \\nsatu gram feses ditimbang tepat, masing-\\nmasing dimasukkan ke dalam akuarium butir \\ndemi butir dan dihitung waktu untuk me-\\nngendap sampai di batas tanda pada kedala-\\nman 100 cm. Observasi kecepatan pengen-\\ndapan dilakukan sebanyak 20 ulangan untuk \\nsetiap kelompok feses. Hal sama juga dila-\\nkukan terhadap sisa pakan. Kecepatan pe-\\nngendapan (KP) dihitung dengan formula : \\n \\nKP (cm/dt)=panjang kolom air 100 cm/  \\nwaktu yang dibutuhkan untuk mengendap \\n(dt) ……..………………….. (2) \\n \\n2.5. Dispersi Limbah Budidaya dan \\nLuasan Dampak \\nDispersi dan beban limbah organik \\npartikel ke sedimen tergantung pada jumlah \\nlimbah yang diproduksi, luasan budidaya, \\nkedalaman air di teluk, kecepatan arus, dan \\nlaju pengendapan limbah partikel. Model \\ndispersi limbah umumnya didasarkan atas \\nprinsip bahwa partikel feses dan pakan yang \\ntidak dimakan akan jatuh  dengan laju,  Vs \\nmelalui kedalaman air, D akan menempuh  \\nwaktu t=D/Vs untuk mencapai dasar  \\nperairan. Selama perjalanannya, arus dengan \\nkecepatan, Cv akan memindahkan partikel \\ntersebut secara horizontal dengan jarak d= \\nCv/t= D*Cv/s dari KJA. Perkiraan dispersi \\nlimbah dapat dihitung dengan persamaan \\nyang dîkemukakan oleh Gowen et al. (1989) \\ndiacu dalam (Barg, 1992 dan Beveridge, \\n1996) sebagai berikut: \\nJunaidi dan Hamzah \\n                  Jurnal Ilmu dan Teknologi Kelautan Tropis, Vol. 7, No. 1, Juni 2015                    291 \\nd = D x Cv / Vs ………………………… (3) \\n \\ndimana d= jarak dìspersi horizontal dari \\npartikel (m); D = kedalaman air di teluk (m); \\nCv= arus air (m/s); Vs= kecepatan pengen-\\ndapan limbah partikel pakan yang yang tidak \\ndimakan dan feses (m/s). \\nMelalui proses penyederhanaan, di-\\nmana dimensi lahan budidaya dan jarak \\npenyebaran melintang dan memanjang teluk, \\nmaka menurut Gillibrand et al. (2002), \\ndampak areal dasar perairan= AI (Wi), dapat \\ndihitung dengan persamaaan sebagai berikut: \\n \\nAI (Wi)= π (LF + DF) (LF + DY) ...……. (4) \\n \\ndimana: AI dihitung sebagai suatu elip \\ndengan axis utama (LF + DF) dan axis minor \\n(LF + DY). Areal AI dihitung untuk kece-\\npatan pengendapan tunggal, Wi. Dengan \\nmenggunakan rentang kecepatan pengenda-\\npan, sejumlah areal dasar perairan yang dipe-\\nngaruhi oleh perbedaan ukuran feses dapat \\nditentukan. \\n \\nIII. HASIL DAN PEMBAHASAN \\n \\n3.1.  Keragaan Budidaya Udang Karang \\ndalam KJA \\nBudidaya udang karang berlangsung \\nselama 9 bulan (270 hari) dalam 3 petak KJA  \\nberukuran 3 x 3 x 3 m3, dengan padat \\npenebaran tiap KJA sebanyak 150 ekor,  \\nmasing-masing dengan ukuran rata-rata yang \\nberbeda yaitu 45  g, 30 g, dan 15 g.  Selama \\nmasa pemeliharaan terjadi pertambahan \\nbobot biomassa udang  karang dari 15 – 45 g \\nmenjadi  151 – 220 g, dengan rata-rata laju \\npertumbuhan harian (LPH)  0,59 – 0,86 %, \\nrasio konversi pakan (RKP)  9,66 – 12,11 \\ndan sintasan 63,33 – 70 %. RKP dan sintasan \\nyang didapatkan dalam penelitian ini relatif \\nsama dengan hasil penelitian ACIAR-SADI, \\nyaitu RKP 12,0 dan sintasan 60% (Jones, \\n2010), sedangkan dengan pemberian pakan \\nberupa ikan Sardin (Sardinella spp) sebanyak \\n10%-20% diperoleh sintasan lebih tinggi \\nyaitu 86,7% (Becira dan Orcajada, 2006). \\nLaju pertumbuhan harian lebih tinggi diban-\\ndingkan penelitian Aslianti et al. (2004) yaitu \\n0,236 %. \\n \\n3.2. Laju Sedimentasi Limbah   \\nLaju sedimentasi di bawah KJA pada  \\nbudidaya udang karang selama 270 hari \\nberkisar antara 14,92-27,33 (20,66±4,60) \\ng/m2/hari, lebih tinggi dibandingkan dengan \\nlokasi pengamatan di bagian utara, timur, \\nselatan dan barat KJA pada jarak  50 dan 100 \\nm (Gambar 2). Hal ini menunjukkan bahwa \\nkegiatan budidaya udang karang dalam KJA \\nmemberikan konstribusi yang cukup signi-\\nfikan terhadap laju sedimentasi yang berasal \\ndari partikel organik (feses dan sisa pakan).  \\nLaju sedimentasi yang paling kecil berada \\npada bagian sebelah timur KJA baik untuk \\njarak 50 m maupun 100 m, sedangkan pada \\nbagian utara, selatan dan barat relatif sama. \\nPola penyebaran sedimen terkait dengan pola \\narus pasang yang mengarah dari timur dan \\nsurut dari arah barat serta arah  datang arus \\ntegak lurus dengan posisi KJA, sehingga \\npenyebaran sedimen lebih dominan pada \\nbagian utara, selatan dan barat posisi KJA \\nkarena lebih dekat ke arah pantai. Hal ini \\nmenunjukkan bahwa sedimen yang berasal \\ndari KJA tidak menyebar jauh dari lokasi \\nKJA, karena kecepatan rata-rata arus berkisar \\nantara 0,068-0,2 m/dt. \\n \\n3.3. Laju Pengendapan  Feses dan Pakan \\nLaju pengendapan feses udang karang \\nukuran  <0,5 mm adalah 3,73±0,33 cm/dt, \\nsedangkan feses kering berukuran >0,5 \\nadalah 5,95±0,42 cm/dt (Tabel 1).  Semakin \\nbesar bobot  pakan ikan rucah, laju pengen-\\ndapan semakin cepat. Laju pengendapan \\nfeses dan pakan berperan penting pendugaan \\ndispersi limbah budidaya di dasar perairan. \\nGillibrand et al. (2002), melaporkan laju \\npengendapan, kecepatan arus dan kedalaman \\nperairan mempengaruhi dispersi feses atau \\npakan yang tidak dimakan di dasar perairan. \\nLaju Sedimentasi dan Dispersi Limbah Organik Budidaya Udang Karang dalam . . . \\n292                                                         http://itk.fpik.ipb.ac.id/ej_itkt71 \\n \\n \\nGambar 2.

Dispersi dan Luas Dampak Limbah  \\nLimbah padat budidaya udang karang \\ndalam KJA terdiri dari sisa pakan dan feses, \\nakan terdispersi dan sebagian besar menetap \\ndibawah atau dalam jarak tertentu dari KJA. \\nSebaran lokasi dan jumlah limbah padat yang \\ntersedimentasi tergantung pada jumlah lim-\\nbah, kecepatan tenggelamnya partikel, kece-\\npatan arus dan kedalaman air.  Berdasarkan \\npengamatan dan analisis laju sedimentasi \\ndiperoleh bahwa limbah padat budidaya \\nudang karang tidak menyebar jauh dari lokasi \\nKJA, karena arus laut hanya berkisar antara \\n0,068-0,2 m/dt. Kecepatan pengendapan fe-\\nses dan sisa pakan berkisar antara 0,0373 – \\n0,072 m/dt, kedalaman perairan 8,50 m, \\nmaka dengan Gowen et al. (1989) dalam \\nBarg (1992) diperoleh penyebaran partikel \\nfeses dan sisa pakan mencapai jarak antara \\n8,24-45,58 m dari KJA (Gambar 3). \\nHasil penelitian Morrisey et al. \\n(2000), mendapatkan bahwa sedimen dasar \\ndiperairan di bawah KJA yang mengalami \\nperubahan fisika dan kimia tidak lebih dari \\n50 m dari KJA, sementara McGhie et al. \\n(2000) menyebutkan sebaran beban limbah \\norganik menjadi jarak 20 m  dari pusat KJA, \\ndan pemusatan sedimen dapat menutupi \\nJunaidi dan Hamzah \\n                  Jurnal Ilmu dan Teknologi Kelautan Tropis, Vol. 7, No. 1, Juni 2015                   293 \\ndasar perairan mencapai jarak 30 m dari KJA \\n(Rachmansyah, 2004). Jika dilihat dari \\ndispersi sedimen selama kurun waktu peme-\\nliharaan udang karang, terlihat bahwa pemu-\\nsatan pengendapan bahan organik mem-\\nbentuk bidang elip di bawah KJA (Gambar \\n4). Perubahan wilayah dampak yang terjadi \\nakibat pola arus.  \\nInformasi laju sedimentasi (Gambar \\n2) memiliki pola yang relatif sama dengan \\nhasil perhitungan jarak sebaran pengendapan \\npa-datan organik (Gambar 3). Hal ini berarti \\ndata laju sedimentasi di sekitar KJA yang \\ndiukur dapat mendukung pembuktian bahwa \\nmodel pendugaan jarak penyebaran pengen-\\ndapan di sekitar KJA yang didasarkan atas \\ninformasi kedalaman, kecepatan arus, dan \\nkecepatan pengendapan dapat menggam-\\nbarkan wilayah dampak KJA. Berdasarkan \\npenyebaran limbah padat dari KJA di dasar \\nperairan, maka untuk menghindari penum-\\npukan partikel limbah di dasar KJA, maka \\ntata letak antar unit KJA harus berjarak \\nminimal 2 kali jarak terjauh penyebaran \\npartikel (2 x 45,58 = 91,16 m) atau dibuatkan \\nmenjadi  >100 m. Pemulihan lingkungan \\nbentik di dasar KJA dapat dilakukan dengan \\nmenerapkan sistem rotasi letak KJA untuk \\nmemberikan peluang terjadinya proses pemu-\\nlihan lingkungan bentik secara alami. \\nMenurut Gillibrand  et al. (2002), wi-\\nlayah dampak limbah padat budidaya dalam \\nKJA dalam teluk berbentuk ellips karena \\nlebar teluk memiliki arus pasut melintang \\nteluk dibandingkan dengan besarnya ampli-\\ntudo memanjang teluk, dimana panjang dan \\nsempit teluk akan banyak melemahkan \\namplitudo arua melintang sehingga jarak pe-\\nnyebaran melintang teluk menjadi lebih ke-\\ncil. Usaha budidaya  udang karang dengan 1 \\nunit rakit yang berukuran 11 x 11 m2  yang \\nterdiri dari 9 petak KJA masing-masing \\nberukuran 3 x 3 m2, maka luas dampak ben-\\ntik dengan kecepatan arus 0,067 – 0.2 m/dt \\ndan laju pengendapan feses dan pakan \\nberkisar antara 0,0373 – 0,072 m/dt, maka \\nwilayah dampak berkisar antara 1.352,41 – \\n3.370,39 m2. Luas wilayah dampak KJA \\ndalam penelitian lebih besar dibandingkan \\nhasil penelitian Rachmansyah (2004) di Te-\\nluk Awarange Kabupaten Barru, Sulawesi \\nSelatan yaitu berkisara antara 493 – 1.097 \\nm2.

Ruiz et al. (2001) mela-\\nporkan bahwa loading yang berasal dari \\nbudidaya ikan (30 KJA pada luasan 7 ha dan \\nkedalaman 20 m) akan berdampak pada hi-\\nlangnya padang lamun (Posidonia oceanica) \\nseluas 11,29 ha. Dampak lain limbah budi-\\ndaya ini adalah terjadinya penurunan keane-\\nkaragaman infauna dalam sedimen dan de-\\ngradasi dasar perairan, jika limbah meng-\\nhasilkan deposit C organik melebihi 0,7 \\nkgC/m2/tahun (Gillibrand et al., 2002).  \\nDampak limbah budidaya udang karang da-\\nlam KJA di Teluk Ekas secara nyata belum \\nberpengaruh terhadap penurunan keaneka-\\nragaman hayati, ataupun kondisi hypoxia, \\nakan tetapi hanya berpengaruh terhadap \\npenurunan kualitas (Junaidi dan Hamzah, \\n2014).   \\nAktivitas budidaya dalam KJA ter-\\nnyata merupakan atraktor (daya tarik)  bagi \\nikan liar di sekitar lokasi KJA. Ikan-ikan liar \\ntersebut akan berkumpul di sekitar KJA \\ndengan berbagai sebab misalnya untuk men-\\ncari makan dari sisa makanan yang lolos dari \\nKJA, karena bau pakan (ikan rucah) yang \\nkhas. Bahkan sisa pakan yang masih tertam-\\npung dalam jaring oleh jenis ikan tertentu \\nseperti ikan buntal berusaha untuk memakan \\nsisa pakan dengan menggigit jaring sampai \\nbocor.  Karena itu, masih banyak informasi \\nilmiah yang dibutuhkan untuk melengkapi \\nmodel agar mendekati ke kondisi sistem yang \\nJunaidi dan Hamzah \\n                  Jurnal Ilmu dan Teknologi Kelautan Tropis, Vol. 7, No. 1, Juni 2015                   295 \\nsebenarnya. Namun demikian, model terse-\\nbut dapat digunakan sebagai acuan untuk \\nmengelola sumberdaya perikanan budidaya \\ndalam upaya meminimalkan dampak ter-\\nhadap kondisi dasar perairan di bawah KJA, \\nkhususnya yang berkaitan dengan pengaturan  \\ntata letak unit KJA. \\n \\nIV. KESIMPULAN  \\n \\nLaju sedimentasi di bawah KJA pada  \\nbudidaya udang karang selama 270 hari di per-\\nairan Teluk Ekas berkisar antara 14,92-27,33 \\n(20,66±4,60) g/m2/hari. Limbah organik budi-\\ndaya udang karang tidak menyebar jauh dari \\nlokasi KJA, karena arus laut hanya berkisar \\nantara 0,068-0,2 m/dt. Kecepatan pengendapan \\nfeses dan sisa pakan berkisar antara 0,0373 – \\n0,072 m/dt dengan kedalaman perairan 8,50 m, \\nmaka diperoleh penyebaran partikel feses dan \\nsisa pakan mencapai jarak antara 8,24-45,58 m \\ndari KJA. Berdasarkan penyebaran limbah or-\\nganik dari KJA di dasar perairan, maka untuk \\nmenghindari penumpukan partikel limbah di \\ndasar KJA, maka tata letak antar unit KJA harus \\nberjarak minimal 2 kali jarak terjauh penyebaran \\npartikel (2 x 45,58 = 91,16 m) atau dibuatkan \\nmenjadi  >100 m. \\n \\nUCAPAN TERIMA KASIH \\n \\nKami berterima kasih kepada Saudara \\nMuhammad Zainul Hayyi, S.Pi., dan Andy \\nMattalata atas bantuannya dalam pengum-\\npulan data di lapang dan analisis di labo-\\nratorium. \\n \\nDAFTAR PUSTAKA \\n \\nAslianti, T., B.

Measurement of sedimentation rate was conducted every month during the process of cultivation lobster. This measurement was done by setting up a sediment trap under and around the cage. The result of this study showed that sedimentation rate under the lobster cage within 270 days ranged from 14.92 to 27.33 (20.66±4.60) g/m2/day. The organic waste did not disperse far away from the cage because of the small current rate around the cage location of 0.068 to 0.2 m/s. Feces and residual feed settling velocities followed the current direction within the range of 0.0373 to 0.072 m/s with 8.50 m of water depth. According to this result,  dispersion of feces particle and residual food was between 8.24 and 45.58 m from the cage. In order to prevent an accumulation of waste particle on the water bottom, the distance between cages needs to be set to at least twice of the farthest distance of particle dispersion which is 2 x 45.58 = 91.16 m or about 100 m.

When a mixture of all the components was\\nallowed to react, only two cages were formed, which suggests a high-fidelity\\nself-recognition.

       "    'description': 'The objective of this study was to determine sedimentation rate and dispersion of organic waste from lobster culture on cage in Ekas Bay, West Nusa Tenggara Province. Measurement of sedimentation rate was conducted every month during the process of cultivation lobster. This measurement was done by setting up a sediment trap under and around the cage. The result of this study showed that sedimentation rate under the lobster cage within 270 days ranged from 14.92 to 27.33 (20.66±4.60) g/m2/day. The organic waste did not disperse far away from the cage because of the small current rate around the cage location of 0.068 to 0.2 m/s. Feces and residual feed settling velocities followed the current direction within the range of 0.0373 to 0.072 m/s with 8.50 m of water depth. According to this result,  dispersion of feces particle and residual food was between 8.24 and 45.58 m from the cage.

Measurement of sedimentation \\nrate was conducted every month during the process of cultivation lobster. This measurement was done \\nby setting up a sediment trap under and around the cage. The result of this study showed that \\nsedimentation rate under the lobster cage within 270 days ranged from 14.92 to 27.33 (20.66±4.60) \\ng/m2/day. The organic waste did not disperse far away from the cage because of the small current rate \\naround the cage location of 0.068 to 0.2 m/s. Feces and residual feed settling velocities followed the \\ncurrent direction within the range of 0.0373 to 0.072 m/s with 8.50 m of water depth. According to this \\nresult,  dispersion of feces particle and residual food was between 8.24 and 45.58 m from the cage. In \\norder to prevent an accumulation of waste particle on the water bottom, the distance between cages \\nneeds to be set to at least twice of the farthest distance of particle dispersion which is 2 x 45.58 = \\n91.16 m or about 100 m.  \\n \\nKeywords: sedimentation rate, waste dispersion, lobster culture, Ekas Bay \\n \\nABSTRAK \\nPenelitian ini bertujuan untuk mengetahui laju sedimentasi dan dispersi limbah organik budidaya udang \\nkarang dalam keramba jaring apung (KJA) di perairan Teluk Ekas Provinsi Nusa Tenggara Barat.  \\nPengukuran sedimen dilakukan setiap bulan selama pemeliharaan udang karang  dengan memasang \\nperangkap sedimen di bawah dan di sekitar  KJA.

PENDAHULUAN \\n \\nUdang karang atau lobster (Spiny \\nlobster) termasuk komoditi perikanan yang \\nmempunyai peranan penting sebagai komodi-\\ntas ekspor dari jenis krustasea setelah udang \\nPenaeid.  Udang ini diperdagangkan dalam \\nkeadaan hidup, dengan harga jual yang  terus \\nmelambung, karena permintaan akan komo-\\nditas ini di pasar global terus meningkat \\nsetiap tahun (Holmyard and  Franz, 2006; \\nSolanki et al., 2012). Pada tahun 2014, eks-\\npor udang karang tercatat US$ 42,8 juta de-\\nngan volume 3.427 ton, dengan negara tujuan \\nLaju Sedimentasi dan Dispersi Limbah Organik Budidaya Udang  Karang  dalam . . . \\n288                                                        http://itk.fpik.ipb.ac.id/ej_itkt71 \\nutama adalah Tiongkok dan Taiwan (BII, \\n2015).  \\nTingginya harga jual telah mendo-\\nrong perkembangan  budidaya udang karang \\nakhir-akhir, dan akibat penurunan hasil tang-\\nkapan di alam (Jones et al., 2010; Jones, \\n2010). Sejak tahun 2000 di Teluk Ekas, Pro-\\nvinsi Nusa Tenggara Barat berkembang budi-\\ndaya udang karang dalam keramba jaring \\napung (KJA). Pada waktu itu banyak ditemu-\\nkan benih alam yang  menempel pada pelam-\\npung dan material lain yang berkaitan dengan \\nbudidaya rumput laut dan kerapu (Priyam-\\nbodo and Sarifin, 2009), kemudian benih-\\nbenih tersebut diambil dan dipelihara dalam \\nKJA, sehingga kegiatan budidaya udang ka-\\nrang  terus berkembang sampai saat ini. \\nPerkembangan kegiatan budidaya di \\nwilayah pesisir dan laut dalam dua dekade \\nterakhir telah memicu perhatian banyak kala-\\nngan akibat dampak lingkungan yang ditim-\\nbulkannya (Mazzola et al., 2000;  Olsen and \\nOlsen, 2008). Meningkatnya budidaya ikan \\nsistem KJA berpotensi sebagai sumber ma-\\nsukkan  bahan organik dalam kolom dan da-\\nsar perairan, baik dalam bentuk padatan mau-\\npun tersuspensi (Shakouri, 2003). Limbah \\nbudidaya yang terlarut dan tersuspensi dalam \\nair dari sisa metabolik dan hasil ekskresi bio-\\nta budidaya tersebar ke kolom perairan oleh \\narus. Limbah padat berupa pakan yang tidak \\ntermakan dan feses tersebar dalam kolom \\nperairan dan terakumulasi di dasar perairan \\nsehingga berdampak pada lingkungan bentik \\n(Nash, 2001; Shakouri, 2003; Caroll et al., \\n2003). Selama sedimentasi, sebagian feses \\ndan sisa pakan tersebut dimangsa oleh orga-\\nnisme bukan budidaya sebelum mencapai \\ndasar perairan (Beveridge, 1996), sedangkan \\nsebahagian lagi pecah menjadi partikel halus \\ndan mengalami pelarutan serta cenderung \\nmeningkatkan turbiditas di sekitar lokasi bu-\\ndidaya (Silvert and Sowles, 1996). \\nDeposit limbah organik diperkirakan \\nmencapai 3 kg/m2/tahun di sekitar KJA, se-\\nmentara di bawah KJA mencapai 10 kg/m2/ \\ntahun (Gowen and Brandy, 1987 dalam Wu,  \\n1995). Sedimen dasar perairan di bawah KJA \\nyang mengalami perubahan fisika dan kimia \\ntidak lebih dari 50 m dari KJA (Morrisey et \\nal., 2000), sementara McGhie et al. (2000) \\nmenyebutkan sebaran beban limbah organik \\nmenjadi jarak 20 dari pusat KJA, dan pemu-\\nsatan sedimen dapat menutupi dasar perairan \\nmencapai jarak 30 m dari KJA (Rachman-\\nsyah, 2004).  Beban limbah budidaya ikan, \\nditambah limbah berbagai sumber lain dari \\ndaratan yang masuk ke perairan teluk ber-\\nkaitan dengan daya dukung untuk pengem-\\nbangan budidaya laut (Scholl et al., 2012).  \\nMenurut Krisanti dan Imran (2006),  kapasi-\\ntas asimilasi limbah perairan Teluk Ekas ter-\\nutama kadar amonia dan nitrat tidak lagi \\nmendukung untuk pengembangan kegiatan \\nbudidaya laut, kecuali dilakukan pengaturan \\ntata letak dan jarak antara unit KJA serta pem-\\nbatasan jumlah KJA yang boleh beroperasi. \\n Limbah partikel organik yang ber-\\nasal dari KJA secara nyata berpengaruh ter-\\nhadap lingkungan bentik (Mazzola et al., \\n2000). Ruiz et al. (2001) melaporkan bahwa \\nloading yang berasal dari budidaya ikan (30 \\nKJA pada luasan 7 ha dan kedalaman 20 m) \\nakan berdampak pada hilangnya padang la-\\nmun (Posidonia oceanica) seluas 11,29 ha. \\nDampak lain limbah budidaya ini adalah \\nterjadinya penurunan keanekaragaman in-\\nfauna dalam sedimen dan degradasi dasar \\nperairan, jika limbah menghasilkan deposit C \\norganik melebihi 0,7 kgC/m2/tahun (Gilli-\\nbrand et al., 2002).  Informasi mengenai laju \\nsedimentasi dan dispersi limbah organik pen-\\nting untuk diketahui dan bagaimana  sebaran \\nsedimen di sekitar KJA, apakah mengikuti \\npola arus atau tidak. Informasi tersebut dapat \\ndigunakan sebagai acuan dalam pengelolaan \\nbudidaya laut secara berkelanjutan terutama  \\nuntuk menentukan tata letak antar unit KJA.  \\nOleh karena, dilakukan penelitian  ini bertu-\\njuan untuk mengetahui laju sedimentasi dan \\ndispersi limbah organik budidaya udang ka-\\nrang dalam KJA di  perairan Teluk Ekas Pro-\\nvinsi Nusa Tenggara Barat. \\n \\n \\nJunaidi dan Hamzah \\n                  Jurnal Ilmu dan Teknologi Kelautan Tropis, Vol. 7, No. 1, Juni 2015                        289 \\nII. METODE PENELITIAN \\n \\n2.1. Wilayah Studi \\nTeluk Ekas terletak di sebelah sela-\\ntan Pulau Lombok, Provinsi Nusa Tenggara \\nBarat (Gambar 1).  Posisinya membujur dari \\nutara ke selatan, dengan letak geografis \\nantara 8o49’15”-8o55’0” LS dan 116o23’0”-\\n116o28’45” BT. Teluk Ekas berhadapan  \\nlangsung dengan Samudera Hindia, dan ber-\\ndekatan dengan Selat Alas yang menghu-\\nbungkan massa air dari Samudra Hindia \\ndengan Samudra Pasifik sehingga teluk ini \\nmenampung banyak suplai nutrien sehingga \\nberpotensi sebagai kawasan pengembangan \\nbudidaya laut (BRKP, 2004).  \\n \\n2.2. Budidaya Udang Karang dalam KJA \\nBudidaya udang karang dilakukan \\ndalam karamba  jaring apung (KJA) ukuran  \\n3 x 3 x 3 m3 sebanyak 3 unit yang  diletakkan \\ndalam satu unit rakit. KJA ditempatkan lo-\\nkasi dengan kedalaman perairan sekitar 8,5 \\nm. Benih udang karang jenis Panulirus \\nhomarus yang berukuran 15, 30, dan 45  \\ng/ekor diperoleh dari tempat pengumpulan di \\nsekitar  lokasi budidaya. Sebelum ditebar di-\\nlakukan proses adaptasi terhadap pakan dan \\nlingkungan budidaya selama seminggu. Pa-\\ndat penebaran adalah 150 ekor/KJA. Selama \\nmasa pemeliharaan yang berlangsung selama \\n270 hari (9 bulan),  diberi pakan berupa ikan \\nrucah (segar). Jumlah pakan yang diberikan \\nadalah 5% dari biomassa ikan setiap hari \\ndengan pemberian 1 kali sehari pada jam \\n17.00. Selama pemeliharaan udang karang \\ndilakukan pengukuran kecepatan arus dengan \\nfloater di sekitar KJA, dengan mengukur \\nwaktu tempuh pelampung menempuh jarak \\ntertentu.\\n \\n \\n \\nGambar 1.

Pendugaan Laju Sedimentasi \\nPengukuran laju pengendapan sedi-\\nmen selama pemeliharaan udang karang seti-\\nap bulan  di sekitar KJA, dilakukan dengan \\nmemasang perangkap sedimen (sediment \\ntrap) yang terbuat dari pipa paralon diameter \\n10,16 cm (4 inchi) dan panjang 50 cm, \\ndipasang dibawah KJA, pada jarak 50 m \\n(N50) dan 100 m (N100) ke arah utara, pada \\njarak 50 m (E50) dan 100 m (E100) ke arah \\ntimur, pada jarak 50 m (S50) dan 100 m \\n(E100) ke arah timur, pada jarak 50 m (S50) \\ndan 100 m (S100) ke arah selatan, dan pada \\njarak 50 m (W50) dan 100 m (W100) ke arah \\nbarat (Gambar 1). Perangkap dipasang pada \\nkedalaman 50 cm dari dasar perairan. Sampel \\nsedimen yang terperangkap tersebut bersum-\\nber dari limbah budidaya dan bukan budida-\\nya, dimana dalam penelitian ini kedua sedi-\\nmen tersebut tidak dipisahkan. Koleksi sedi-\\nmen dilakukan setiap bulan, sampel sedimen \\ndikeringkan dalam oven pada suhu 60 oC se-\\nlama 24 jam (English et al.,  1997), kemu-\\ndian dianalisis kadar air dan ditimbang bo-\\nbotnya. Laju sedimentasi dihitung dengan \\npersamaan (Lunusu dan Fitri, 2008) sebagai \\nberikut : \\n \\nLaju sedimentasi (g/m2/hari)=(Bks/Ap)/t  (1) \\n \\ndimana Bks= bobot kering sedimen (g), Ap= \\nluas penampang paralon (m2) dan t= periode \\nkoleksi sedimen (hari). \\n \\n2.4. Pengujian  Kecepatan Pengendapan \\nFeses dan Sisa Pakan \\nPengujian kecepatan pengendapan \\n(settling velocity) feses dan sisa pakan dila-\\nkukan dengan  mengacu pada metode yang \\ndikemukakan oleh Elbenzon and Kelly \\n(1998) dengan asumsi bahwa limbah partikel \\npakan yang  tidak dimakan dan feses akan \\nbergerak secara vertikel sampai kedasar ka-\\nrena tidak dipengaruhi oleh arus, dan nilai \\nkecepatan pengendapan partikel ini diguna-\\nkan untuk pendugaan model dispersi dan luas \\ndampak dampak limbah budidaya. Wadah \\npercobaan berupa akuarium kaca berukuran \\n20 x 20 cm2 dengan tinggi 125 cm dan \\ndilengkapi dengan mistar yang ditempelkan \\ndi bagian dinding akuarium. Akuarium diisi \\nair laut, bersalinitas 35 ppt yang telah disa-\\nring dengan filter bag, setinggi 120 cm. Pada  \\nbagian bawah akuarium setinggi 20 cm dari \\ndasar, diberi tanda sebagai kolom pengen-\\ndapan (untuk mengurangi tekanan permu-\\nkaan), sekaligus sebagai batas kedalaman air \\n100 cm dan permukaan. \\nFeses kering dikoleksi dengan cara \\nmenampung di bagian bawah KJA, kemudian \\ndikeringkan dan digerus serta diayak dengan \\nsaringan berukuran mata 0,5 mm. Sebanyak \\nsatu gram feses ditimbang tepat, masing-\\nmasing dimasukkan ke dalam akuarium butir \\ndemi butir dan dihitung waktu untuk me-\\nngendap sampai di batas tanda pada kedala-\\nman 100 cm. Observasi kecepatan pengen-\\ndapan dilakukan sebanyak 20 ulangan untuk \\nsetiap kelompok feses. Hal sama juga dila-\\nkukan terhadap sisa pakan. Kecepatan pe-\\nngendapan (KP) dihitung dengan formula : \\n \\nKP (cm/dt)=panjang kolom air 100 cm/  \\nwaktu yang dibutuhkan untuk mengendap \\n(dt) ……..………………….. (2) \\n \\n2.5. Dispersi Limbah Budidaya dan \\nLuasan Dampak \\nDispersi dan beban limbah organik \\npartikel ke sedimen tergantung pada jumlah \\nlimbah yang diproduksi, luasan budidaya, \\nkedalaman air di teluk, kecepatan arus, dan \\nlaju pengendapan limbah partikel. Model \\ndispersi limbah umumnya didasarkan atas \\nprinsip bahwa partikel feses dan pakan yang \\ntidak dimakan akan jatuh  dengan laju,  Vs \\nmelalui kedalaman air, D akan menempuh  \\nwaktu t=D/Vs untuk mencapai dasar  \\nperairan. Selama perjalanannya, arus dengan \\nkecepatan, Cv akan memindahkan partikel \\ntersebut secara horizontal dengan jarak d= \\nCv/t= D*Cv/s dari KJA. Perkiraan dispersi \\nlimbah dapat dihitung dengan persamaan \\nyang dîkemukakan oleh Gowen et al. (1989) \\ndiacu dalam (Barg, 1992 dan Beveridge, \\n1996) sebagai berikut: \\nJunaidi dan Hamzah \\n                  Jurnal Ilmu dan Teknologi Kelautan Tropis, Vol. 7, No. 1, Juni 2015                    291 \\nd = D x Cv / Vs ………………………… (3) \\n \\ndimana d= jarak dìspersi horizontal dari \\npartikel (m); D = kedalaman air di teluk (m); \\nCv= arus air (m/s); Vs= kecepatan pengen-\\ndapan limbah partikel pakan yang yang tidak \\ndimakan dan feses (m/s). \\nMelalui proses penyederhanaan, di-\\nmana dimensi lahan budidaya dan jarak \\npenyebaran melintang dan memanjang teluk, \\nmaka menurut Gillibrand et al. (2002), \\ndampak areal dasar perairan= AI (Wi), dapat \\ndihitung dengan persamaaan sebagai berikut: \\n \\nAI (Wi)= π (LF + DF) (LF + DY) ...……. (4) \\n \\ndimana: AI dihitung sebagai suatu elip \\ndengan axis utama (LF + DF) dan axis minor \\n(LF + DY). Areal AI dihitung untuk kece-\\npatan pengendapan tunggal, Wi. Dengan \\nmenggunakan rentang kecepatan pengenda-\\npan, sejumlah areal dasar perairan yang dipe-\\nngaruhi oleh perbedaan ukuran feses dapat \\nditentukan. \\n \\nIII. HASIL DAN PEMBAHASAN \\n \\n3.1.  Keragaan Budidaya Udang Karang \\ndalam KJA \\nBudidaya udang karang berlangsung \\nselama 9 bulan (270 hari) dalam 3 petak KJA  \\nberukuran 3 x 3 x 3 m3, dengan padat \\npenebaran tiap KJA sebanyak 150 ekor,  \\nmasing-masing dengan ukuran rata-rata yang \\nberbeda yaitu 45  g, 30 g, dan 15 g.  Selama \\nmasa pemeliharaan terjadi pertambahan \\nbobot biomassa udang  karang dari 15 – 45 g \\nmenjadi  151 – 220 g, dengan rata-rata laju \\npertumbuhan harian (LPH)  0,59 – 0,86 %, \\nrasio konversi pakan (RKP)  9,66 – 12,11 \\ndan sintasan 63,33 – 70 %. RKP dan sintasan \\nyang didapatkan dalam penelitian ini relatif \\nsama dengan hasil penelitian ACIAR-SADI, \\nyaitu RKP 12,0 dan sintasan 60% (Jones, \\n2010), sedangkan dengan pemberian pakan \\nberupa ikan Sardin (Sardinella spp) sebanyak \\n10%-20% diperoleh sintasan lebih tinggi \\nyaitu 86,7% (Becira dan Orcajada, 2006). \\nLaju pertumbuhan harian lebih tinggi diban-\\ndingkan penelitian Aslianti et al. (2004) yaitu \\n0,236 %. \\n \\n3.2. Laju Sedimentasi Limbah   \\nLaju sedimentasi di bawah KJA pada  \\nbudidaya udang karang selama 270 hari \\nberkisar antara 14,92-27,33 (20,66±4,60) \\ng/m2/hari, lebih tinggi dibandingkan dengan \\nlokasi pengamatan di bagian utara, timur, \\nselatan dan barat KJA pada jarak  50 dan 100 \\nm (Gambar 2). Hal ini menunjukkan bahwa \\nkegiatan budidaya udang karang dalam KJA \\nmemberikan konstribusi yang cukup signi-\\nfikan terhadap laju sedimentasi yang berasal \\ndari partikel organik (feses dan sisa pakan).  \\nLaju sedimentasi yang paling kecil berada \\npada bagian sebelah timur KJA baik untuk \\njarak 50 m maupun 100 m, sedangkan pada \\nbagian utara, selatan dan barat relatif sama. \\nPola penyebaran sedimen terkait dengan pola \\narus pasang yang mengarah dari timur dan \\nsurut dari arah barat serta arah  datang arus \\ntegak lurus dengan posisi KJA, sehingga \\npenyebaran sedimen lebih dominan pada \\nbagian utara, selatan dan barat posisi KJA \\nkarena lebih dekat ke arah pantai. Hal ini \\nmenunjukkan bahwa sedimen yang berasal \\ndari KJA tidak menyebar jauh dari lokasi \\nKJA, karena kecepatan rata-rata arus berkisar \\nantara 0,068-0,2 m/dt. \\n \\n3.3. Laju Pengendapan  Feses dan Pakan \\nLaju pengendapan feses udang karang \\nukuran  <0,5 mm adalah 3,73±0,33 cm/dt, \\nsedangkan feses kering berukuran >0,5 \\nadalah 5,95±0,42 cm/dt (Tabel 1).  Semakin \\nbesar bobot  pakan ikan rucah, laju pengen-\\ndapan semakin cepat. Laju pengendapan \\nfeses dan pakan berperan penting pendugaan \\ndispersi limbah budidaya di dasar perairan. \\nGillibrand et al. (2002), melaporkan laju \\npengendapan, kecepatan arus dan kedalaman \\nperairan mempengaruhi dispersi feses atau \\npakan yang tidak dimakan di dasar perairan. \\nLaju Sedimentasi dan Dispersi Limbah Organik Budidaya Udang Karang dalam . . . \\n292                                                         http://itk.fpik.ipb.ac.id/ej_itkt71 \\n \\n \\nGambar 2.

Dispersi dan Luas Dampak Limbah  \\nLimbah padat budidaya udang karang \\ndalam KJA terdiri dari sisa pakan dan feses, \\nakan terdispersi dan sebagian besar menetap \\ndibawah atau dalam jarak tertentu dari KJA. \\nSebaran lokasi dan jumlah limbah padat yang \\ntersedimentasi tergantung pada jumlah lim-\\nbah, kecepatan tenggelamnya partikel, kece-\\npatan arus dan kedalaman air.  Berdasarkan \\npengamatan dan analisis laju sedimentasi \\ndiperoleh bahwa limbah padat budidaya \\nudang karang tidak menyebar jauh dari lokasi \\nKJA, karena arus laut hanya berkisar antara \\n0,068-0,2 m/dt. Kecepatan pengendapan fe-\\nses dan sisa pakan berkisar antara 0,0373 – \\n0,072 m/dt, kedalaman perairan 8,50 m, \\nmaka dengan Gowen et al. (1989) dalam \\nBarg (1992) diperoleh penyebaran partikel \\nfeses dan sisa pakan mencapai jarak antara \\n8,24-45,58 m dari KJA (Gambar 3). \\nHasil penelitian Morrisey et al. \\n(2000), mendapatkan bahwa sedimen dasar \\ndiperairan di bawah KJA yang mengalami \\nperubahan fisika dan kimia tidak lebih dari \\n50 m dari KJA, sementara McGhie et al. \\n(2000) menyebutkan sebaran beban limbah \\norganik menjadi jarak 20 m  dari pusat KJA, \\ndan pemusatan sedimen dapat menutupi \\nJunaidi dan Hamzah \\n                  Jurnal Ilmu dan Teknologi Kelautan Tropis, Vol. 7, No. 1, Juni 2015                   293 \\ndasar perairan mencapai jarak 30 m dari KJA \\n(Rachmansyah, 2004). Jika dilihat dari \\ndispersi sedimen selama kurun waktu peme-\\nliharaan udang karang, terlihat bahwa pemu-\\nsatan pengendapan bahan organik mem-\\nbentuk bidang elip di bawah KJA (Gambar \\n4). Perubahan wilayah dampak yang terjadi \\nakibat pola arus.  \\nInformasi laju sedimentasi (Gambar \\n2) memiliki pola yang relatif sama dengan \\nhasil perhitungan jarak sebaran pengendapan \\npa-datan organik (Gambar 3). Hal ini berarti \\ndata laju sedimentasi di sekitar KJA yang \\ndiukur dapat mendukung pembuktian bahwa \\nmodel pendugaan jarak penyebaran pengen-\\ndapan di sekitar KJA yang didasarkan atas \\ninformasi kedalaman, kecepatan arus, dan \\nkecepatan pengendapan dapat menggam-\\nbarkan wilayah dampak KJA. Berdasarkan \\npenyebaran limbah padat dari KJA di dasar \\nperairan, maka untuk menghindari penum-\\npukan partikel limbah di dasar KJA, maka \\ntata letak antar unit KJA harus berjarak \\nminimal 2 kali jarak terjauh penyebaran \\npartikel (2 x 45,58 = 91,16 m) atau dibuatkan \\nmenjadi  >100 m. Pemulihan lingkungan \\nbentik di dasar KJA dapat dilakukan dengan \\nmenerapkan sistem rotasi letak KJA untuk \\nmemberikan peluang terjadinya proses pemu-\\nlihan lingkungan bentik secara alami. \\nMenurut Gillibrand  et al. (2002), wi-\\nlayah dampak limbah padat budidaya dalam \\nKJA dalam teluk berbentuk ellips karena \\nlebar teluk memiliki arus pasut melintang \\nteluk dibandingkan dengan besarnya ampli-\\ntudo memanjang teluk, dimana panjang dan \\nsempit teluk akan banyak melemahkan \\namplitudo arua melintang sehingga jarak pe-\\nnyebaran melintang teluk menjadi lebih ke-\\ncil. Usaha budidaya  udang karang dengan 1 \\nunit rakit yang berukuran 11 x 11 m2  yang \\nterdiri dari 9 petak KJA masing-masing \\nberukuran 3 x 3 m2, maka luas dampak ben-\\ntik dengan kecepatan arus 0,067 – 0.2 m/dt \\ndan laju pengendapan feses dan pakan \\nberkisar antara 0,0373 – 0,072 m/dt, maka \\nwilayah dampak berkisar antara 1.352,41 – \\n3.370,39 m2. Luas wilayah dampak KJA \\ndalam penelitian lebih besar dibandingkan \\nhasil penelitian Rachmansyah (2004) di Te-\\nluk Awarange Kabupaten Barru, Sulawesi \\nSelatan yaitu berkisara antara 493 – 1.097 \\nm2.

Ruiz et al. (2001) mela-\\nporkan bahwa loading yang berasal dari \\nbudidaya ikan (30 KJA pada luasan 7 ha dan \\nkedalaman 20 m) akan berdampak pada hi-\\nlangnya padang lamun (Posidonia oceanica) \\nseluas 11,29 ha. Dampak lain limbah budi-\\ndaya ini adalah terjadinya penurunan keane-\\nkaragaman infauna dalam sedimen dan de-\\ngradasi dasar perairan, jika limbah meng-\\nhasilkan deposit C organik melebihi 0,7 \\nkgC/m2/tahun (Gillibrand et al., 2002).  \\nDampak limbah budidaya udang karang da-\\nlam KJA di Teluk Ekas secara nyata belum \\nberpengaruh terhadap penurunan keaneka-\\nragaman hayati, ataupun kondisi hypoxia, \\nakan tetapi hanya berpengaruh terhadap \\npenurunan kualitas (Junaidi dan Hamzah, \\n2014).   \\nAktivitas budidaya dalam KJA ter-\\nnyata merupakan atraktor (daya tarik)  bagi \\nikan liar di sekitar lokasi KJA. Ikan-ikan liar \\ntersebut akan berkumpul di sekitar KJA \\ndengan berbagai sebab misalnya untuk men-\\ncari makan dari sisa makanan yang lolos dari \\nKJA, karena bau pakan (ikan rucah) yang \\nkhas. Bahkan sisa pakan yang masih tertam-\\npung dalam jaring oleh jenis ikan tertentu \\nseperti ikan buntal berusaha untuk memakan \\nsisa pakan dengan menggigit jaring sampai \\nbocor.  Karena itu, masih banyak informasi \\nilmiah yang dibutuhkan untuk melengkapi \\nmodel agar mendekati ke kondisi sistem yang \\nJunaidi dan Hamzah \\n                  Jurnal Ilmu dan Teknologi Kelautan Tropis, Vol. 7, No. 1, Juni 2015                   295 \\nsebenarnya. Namun demikian, model terse-\\nbut dapat digunakan sebagai acuan untuk \\nmengelola sumberdaya perikanan budidaya \\ndalam upaya meminimalkan dampak ter-\\nhadap kondisi dasar perairan di bawah KJA, \\nkhususnya yang berkaitan dengan pengaturan  \\ntata letak unit KJA. \\n \\nIV. KESIMPULAN  \\n \\nLaju sedimentasi di bawah KJA pada  \\nbudidaya udang karang selama 270 hari di per-\\nairan Teluk Ekas berkisar antara 14,92-27,33 \\n(20,66±4,60) g/m2/hari. Limbah organik budi-\\ndaya udang karang tidak menyebar jauh dari \\nlokasi KJA, karena arus laut hanya berkisar \\nantara 0,068-0,2 m/dt. Kecepatan pengendapan \\nfeses dan sisa pakan berkisar antara 0,0373 – \\n0,072 m/dt dengan kedalaman perairan 8,50 m, \\nmaka diperoleh penyebaran partikel feses dan \\nsisa pakan mencapai jarak antara 8,24-45,58 m \\ndari KJA. Berdasarkan penyebaran limbah or-\\nganik dari KJA di dasar perairan, maka untuk \\nmenghindari penumpukan partikel limbah di \\ndasar KJA, maka tata letak antar unit KJA harus \\nberjarak minimal 2 kali jarak terjauh penyebaran \\npartikel (2 x 45,58 = 91,16 m) atau dibuatkan \\nmenjadi  >100 m. \\n \\nUCAPAN TERIMA KASIH \\n \\nKami berterima kasih kepada Saudara \\nMuhammad Zainul Hayyi, S.Pi., dan Andy \\nMattalata atas bantuannya dalam pengum-\\npulan data di lapang dan analisis di labo-\\nratorium. \\n \\nDAFTAR PUSTAKA \\n \\nAslianti, T., B.

Measurement of sedimentation rate was conducted every month during the process of cultivation lobster. This measurement was done by setting up a sediment trap under and around the cage. The result of this study showed that sedimentation rate under the lobster cage within 270 days ranged from 14.92 to 27.33 (20.66±4.60) g/m2/day. The organic waste did not disperse far away from the cage because of the small current rate around the cage location of 0.068 to 0.2 m/s. Feces and residual feed settling velocities followed the current direction within the range of 0.0373 to 0.072 m/s with 8.50 m of water depth. According to this result,  dispersion of feces particle and residual food was between 8.24 and 45.58 m from the cage. In order to prevent an accumulation of waste particle on the water bottom, the distance between cages needs to be set to at least twice of the farthest distance of particle dispersion which is 2 x 45.58 = 91.16 m or about 100 m.

       "    'description': 'We present here a simple method for the bottom-up fabrication of microporous organic particles with surface areas in the range 500–1000 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>–1</sup>. The method involves chiral recognition between prefabricated, intrinsically porous organic cage molecules that precipitate spontaneously upon mixing in solution. Fine control over particle size from 50 nm to 1 μm can be achieved by varying the mixing temperature or the rate of mixing. No surfactants or templates are required, and the resulting organic dispersions are stable for months. In this method, the covalent synthesis of the cage modules can be separated from their solution processing into particles because the modules can be dissolved in common solvents. This allows a “mix and match” approach to porous organic particles. The marked solubility change that occurs upon mixing cages with opposite chirality is rationalized by density functional theory calculations that suggest favorable intermolecular interactions for heterochiral cage pairings. The important contribution of molecular disorder to porosity and surface area is highlighted. In one case, a purposefully amorphized sample has more than twice the surface area of its crystalline analogue',\n",

No surfactants or templates are required, and the resulting organic dispersions are stable for months. In this method, the covalent synthesis of the cage modules can be separated from their solution processing into particles because the modules can be dissolved in common solvents. This allows a “mix and match” approach to porous organic particles. The marked solubility change that occurs upon mixing cages with opposite chirality is rationalized by density functional theory calculations that suggest favorable intermolecular interactions for heterochiral cage pairings. The important contribution of molecular disorder to porosity and surface area is highlighted. In one case, a purposefully amorphized sample has more than twice the surface area of its crystalline analogue.</dc:description><dc:date>\\n          2012-01-11T00:00:00Z</dc:date><dc:type>\\n          Text</dc:type><dc:type>\\n          Journal contribution</dc:type><dc:identifier>\\n          10.1021/ja209156v.s001</dc:identifier><dc:relation>\\n          https://figshare.com/articles/Porous_Organic_Cage_Nanocrystals_by_Solution_Mixing/2562649</dc:relation><dc:rights>\\n          CC BY-NC 4.0</dc:rights>\\n        </oai_dc:dc>\\n      </metadata>\\n    </record>',\n",

       "    'description': 'A completely unsymmetrical porous organic cage was synthesised from a C2v symmetrical building block that was identified by a computational screen. The cage was formed through a 12-fold imine condensation of a tritopic C2v symmetric trialdehyde with a ditopic C2 symmetric diamine in a [4 + 6] reaction. The cage was rigid and microporous, as predicted by the simulations, with an apparent Brunauer–Emmett–Teller surface area of 578 m2 g−1. The reduced symmetry of the tritopic building block relative to its topicity meant there were 36 possible structural isomers of the cage. Experimental characterisation suggests a single isomer with 12 unique imine environments, but techniques such as NMR could not conclusively identify the isomer. Computational structural and electronic analysis of the possible isomers was used to identify the most likely candidates, and hence to construct a 3-dimensional model of the amorphous solid. The rational design of unsymmetrical cages using building blocks with reduced symmetry offers new possibilities in controlling the degree of crystallinity, porosity, and solubility, of self-assembled materials',\n",

The majority of hypothetical organic\\ncages suffer from a lack of shape persistence and as a result lack\\nintrinsic porosity, rendering them unsuitable for many applications.\\nWe have created the largest computational database of these molecules\\nto date, numbering 63,472 cages, formed through a range of reaction\\nchemistries and in multiple topologies. We study our database and\\nidentify features which lead to the formation of shape persistent\\ncages. We find that the imine condensation of trialdehydes and diamines\\nin a [4 + 6] reaction is the most likely to result in shape persistent\\ncages, whereas thiol reactions are most likely to give collapsed cages.\\nUsing this database, we develop machine learning models capable of\\npredicting shape persistence with an accuracy of up to 93%, reducing\\nthe time taken to predict this property to milliseconds, and removing\\nthe need for specialist software. In addition, we develop machine\\nlearning models for two other key properties of these molecules, cavity\\nsize and symmetry.

       "    'description': 'The field of supramolecular chemistry has enabled organic chemists to construct molecules of higher order complexity based on both covalent and noncovalent interactions. Receiving inspiration from biochemical systems, supramolecular chemistry has also been termed “chemistry beyond the molecule” because of its dominant use of interactions beyond the covalent bond, such as H-bonding, crystal packing, π–π stacking, metal coordination, halogen bonding, hydrophobic interactions, and the like[1]. Some examples of the chemical structures that became possible to synthesize by employing supramolecular strategies are macrocycles (e.g. cyclodextrins, crown ethers, calixarenes), mechanically interlocked molecular architectures (e.g. rotaxanes), molecular cages (e.g. metal–organic polyhedral), and so forth[2]. This thesis work was focused on the efficient synthesis of purely organic D3h cage linked through hydrazone (R1R2C=NNH2) functionality. A novel cage was constructed using dynamic covalent chemistry approach and hydrogen bond facilitated self-assembly in 95% yield. The design of the building blocks for this dimeric hydrazone-linked cage was tailored to be water-compatible and allow interactions with biologically significant guests, such as α-crocin, a carotenoid pigment found in saffron[3]. The binding constant of the cage with crocin was determined to be (3.2 ± 0.2) x 102 M–1 at 298 K with the 2:1 crocin: Dim-1 stoichiometry. The potential applications of this hydrazone-linked cage for supramolecular catalysis, biosensor development and drug delivery are part of current and future investigations. During the synthesis of the cage product, an interesting stereochemical behavior of the cage vertex precursor, syn-3, was also investigated. This compound existed as a mixture of atropoisomers in the solution but was amplified to a single stereoisomer by crystal-packing driven solid-state enrichment method developed by us[4]. The method of crystal-packing enrichment was extended to another complex mixture of atropoisomers leading to successful amplification of a minor atropoisomer. Both parts of this thesis work demonstrate how supramolecular interactions, ubiquitous in biological systems, could be applied in organic synthesis for generation of three-dimensional cages and analysis of the stereochemical behavior',\n",

The SF<sub>6</sub> uptake of these materials is considerably higher than would be expected\\nfrom the static pore structures. The location of SF<sub>6</sub> within\\nthese materials is elucidated by X-ray crystallography, and it is\\nshown that cooperative diffusion and structural rearrangements in\\nthese molecular crystals can rationalize their superior SF<sub>6</sub>/N<sub>2</sub> selectivity.</dc:description><dc:date>\\n          2016-02-10T00:00:00Z</dc:date><dc:type>\\n          Text</dc:type><dc:type>\\n          Journal contribution</dc:type><dc:identifier>\\n          10.1021/jacs.5b11797.s001</dc:identifier><dc:relation>\\n          https://figshare.com/articles/Porous_Organic_Cages_for_Sulfur_Hexafluoride_Separation/2072575</dc:relation><dc:rights>\\n          CC BY-NC 4.0</dc:rights>\\n        </oai_dc:dc>\\n      </metadata>\\n    </record>',\n",

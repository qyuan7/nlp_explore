Single-crystal structure analysis reveals that the caivity is surrounded by four phosphate uints. Good selectivity of CO2 adsorption over CH4 is demonstrated by the gas adsorption experiment."
1,10.1002/chem.201705713,"The synthesis of shape‐persistent organic cage compounds is often based on the usage of multiple dynamic covalent bond formation (such as imines) of readily available precursors. By careful choice of the precursors geometry, the geometry and size of the resulting cage can be accurately designed and indeed a number of different geometries and sizes have been realized to date. Despite of this fact, little is known about the precursors conformational rigidity and steric preorganization of reacting functional groups on the outcome of the reaction. Herein, the influence of conformational rigidity in the precursors on the formation of a [4+4] imine cage with truncated tetrahedral geometry is discussed."
2,10.1038/s41467-018-05271-9,"Supramolecular synthesis is a powerful strategy for assembling complex molecules, but to do this by targeted design is challenging. This is because multicomponent assembly reactions have the potential to form a wide variety of products. High-throughput screening can explore a broad synthetic space, but this is inefficient and inelegant when applied blindly. Here we fuse computation with robotic synthesis to create a hybrid discovery workflow for discovering new organic cage molecules, and by extension, other supramolecular systems. A total of 78 precursor combinations were investigated by computation and experiment, leading to 33 cages that were formed cleanly in one-pot syntheses. Comparison of calculations with experimental outcomes across this broad library shows that computation has the power to focus experiments, for example by identifying linkers that are less likely to be reliable for cage formation. Screening also led to the unplanned discovery of a new cage topology—doubly bridged, triply interlocked cage catenanes."
3,10.1039/c4cc06225f,Dynamic covalent imine chemistry has been utilized to synthesize a fluorescent [3+2] self-assembled nanoscopic organic cage. The fluorescent nature of the reduced analogue of the cage was further exploited for the highly selective detection of the explosive picric acid (PA).
4,10.1021/ja00007a060,"We report here the simple synthesis2 of hemicarcerand 1 and of 14 carceplexes composed of 1 containing guests of large enough dimensions to sterically inhibit dissociation and permit their isolation and characterization. We suggest the term “constrictive binding” for this phenomenon,3 exemplified previously by the complexation of xenon by an empty hemicarcerand in CDC13.4 The ‘H NMR spectrum of l2 is consistent with the D4h symmetry of the drawing of 1, whose CPK model appears unstrained, and whose cavity is complementary to CPK models of [3.3]paracyclophane or to 9,1 O-dimethoxyanthracene."
5,10.1021/ol100215c,"A π-templated dynamic [2 + 2 + 1] clipping protocol is established for the synthesis of [2]catenanes from two parts dialdehyde, two parts diamine, and one part tetracationic cyclophane. It is further diversified for the selective formation of an unsymmetrical [2]catenane showing great translational selectivity by employing two different dialdehydes in a one-pot reaction. The dual selectivity and the dynamic nature are verified by 1H NMR spectroscopy, X-ray single-crystal structural studies, and exchange experiments."
6,10.1039/c5ob01956g,"An investigation into the most suitable alkali metal ions for templating the assembly of [2]catenanes from di-, tri-, and tetra(ethylene glycol)-containing guest diamines and isophthalaldehyde has indicated that Na+, K+, and Rb+ ions are optimal for preparing [2]catenanes containing at least one di(ethylene glycol) unit, two tri(ethylene glycol) units, and at least one tetra(ethylene glycol) unit [in the absence of a di(ethylene glycol) unit], respectively."
7,10.1038/NCHEM.739,"Interlocked molecules comprise two or more separate components that are joined by ‘mechanical’ rather than covalent bonds. In other words, these molecular assemblies cannot be dissociated without the cleavage of one or more chemical bonds. Although recent progress has enabled the preparation of such topologies through coordination or templating interactions, three-dimensional interlocked covalent architectures remain difficult to prepare. Here, we present a template-free one-pot synthesis of triply interlocked organic cages. These 20-component dimers consist of two tetrahedral monomeric cages each built from four nodes and six linkers. The monomers exhibit axial chirality, which is recognized by their partner cage during the template-free interlocking assembly process. The dimeric cages also include two well-defined cavities per assembly, which for one of the systems studied led to the formation of a supramolecular host–guest chain. These interlocked organic molecules may prove useful as part of a toolkit for the modular construction of complex porous solids and other supramolecular assemblies."
8,10.1021/acs.chemmater.9b03088,"Interlayer interactions play an important role in the formation of two-dimensional covalent organic frameworks (2D COFs), yet the effects of monomer structure on COF formation, crystallinity, and susceptibility to exfoliation are not well understood. Here we probe these effects by studying the stacking behavior of imine-linked macrocycles that represent discrete models of 2D COFs. Specifically, macrocycles based on terephthaldehyde (PDA) or 2,5-dimethoxyterephthaldehyde (DMPDA) stack upon cooling molecularly dissolved solutions. Both macrocycles assemble cooperatively with similar ΔHe values of −97 kJ/mol and −101 kJ/mol, respectively, although the DMPDA macrocycle assembly process showed a more straightforward temperature dependence. Density functional theory calculations of the stacking of PDA macrocycles suggested two stable configurations that were close in energy. Circular dichroism spectroscopy performed on macrocycles bearing chiral side chains revealed a helix reversion process for the PDA macrocycles that was not observed for the DMPDA macrocycles. Given the structural similarity of these monomers, these findings demonstrate that the stacking processes associated with nanotubes derived from these macrocycles, as well as for the corresponding COFs, are complex and susceptible to kinetic traps, casting doubt on the relevance of thermodynamic arguments for improving materials quality. Rather, a deeper understanding of the mechanism of supramolecular polymerization and its interplay with polymerization and error correction during COF synthesis is needed for improved control of the crystallinity and morphology of these emerging materials."

These giant macrocycles possess 6 N2O2 coordination environments and mass spectrometry evidence for hexametallation of one macrocycle is provided. Semi-empirical calculations reveal two stable conformations with boat and chair geometries for the macrocycles metallated with Ni(II), analogous to the conformations observed for cyclohexane."
10,10.1002/anie.201709542,"Columnar liquid crystals composed of a giant macrocyclic mesogen were prepared. The giant macrocyclic mesogen has a square hollow with a 2.5 nm diagonal, which was bounded by diindolo[3,2‐b :2′,3′‐h ]carbazole (diindolocarbazole) moieties as the edges and bis(salicylidene)‐o ‐phenylenediamine (salphen) moieties as the corners. The shape and size of the macrocycle were directly observed by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). Each side of the bright square in the STM image corresponds to a diindolocarbazole moiety, and the length of the sides was consistent with the result of the single crystal analysis of diindolocarbazole. Finally, we successfully obtained a giant macrocycle with long and branched side chains, which exhibited a rectangular columnar LC phase over a wide temperature range. To the best of our knowledge, it contained the largest discrete inner space of any thermotropic columnar liquid crystal composed of macrocyclic mesogens."
11,10.1002/anie.200900716,Cage me! A linear dumbbell‐shaped bipyridinium molecule can template cage formation around itself through sixfold imine bond formation to give an interlocked [2]rotaxane as the single product (see picture). This highly efficient [2+3] clipping occurs despite the symmetry mismatch between the template and the formed macrobicycle.
12,10.1021/ja8096256,"A new crystalline porous three-dimensional covalent organic framework, termed COF-300, has been synthesized and structurally characterized. Tetrahedral tetra-(4-anilyl)-methane and linear terephthaldehyde building blocks were condensed to form imine linkages in a material whose X-ray crystal structure shows five independent diamond frameworks. Despite the interpenetration, the structure has pores of 7.2 Å diameter. Thus, COF-300 shows thermal stability up to 490 °C and permanent porosity with a surface area of 1360 m2 g−1."
13,10.1021/jacs.7b06913,"Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are crystalline, permanently porous, two-dimensional or three-dimensional polymers with tunable topology and functionality. COFs linked with imines or β-ketoenamines are more chemically stable than their boron-linked counterparts, making them more promising for a broad range of applications, including energy storage devices, proton-conductive membranes, and catalyst supports. We report a general and scalable method for synthesizing imine- and β-ketoenamine-linked COFs based on the formal transimination of N-aryl benzophenone imines. These substrates are often the synthetic precursors of traditional polyfunctional aryl amine monomers and are more stable, soluble, and easy to handle and purify. The imine- and β-ketoenamine-linked COFs obtained from this approach show excellent materials quality, as characterized by X-ray diffraction and surface area analysis. The most optimized COF exhibited a Brunauer–Emmett–Teller surface area (>2600 m2/g) very close to its theoretical value (2830 m2/g). This method is amenable to both conventional solvothermal conditions and microwave heating, providing similar or even improved materials quality with shorter reaction times. The high materials quality, scalability, and availability of benzophenone imine monomers are all attractive features of this approach."
14,10.1039/D0CC02033H,"Dynamic covalent bonds have been advantageously used to direct the synthesis of crystalline porous covalent organic frameworks (COFs). Unlike the standard synthetic protocols that involve harsh conditions, this work provides a high-yield “one-pot” green synthesis of imine-based COFs in water. Additionally, this aqueous synthesis can be performed under microwave conditions, considerably reducing the reaction time."
15,10.1002/pola.29236,"A simple method for synthesis of polymers containing shape persistent imine macrocycles as nanohoops in the main chain is studied. It is based on the cyclocondensation reaction carried out in solution and room temperature of triphenylamine‐based tetraaldehyde compounds with (R,R)‐trans‐1,2‐diaminocyclohexane. The pristine polymer P1 bearing long alkyl groups is soluble during the synthesis but becomes insoluble after precipitation due to the strong and multiple CH/π and π‐π stacking intermolecular interactions from arene–arene species and entanglement and interpenetrating of flexible alkyl groups inside of rigid macrocycle hollow. Polymer without any solubilizing groups (P2 ) separates during the polymerization as an insoluble material. Both polymers are amorphous and have good thermal and environmental stability. They have a low surface area because discrete nanovoids introduced by macrocycles are disconnected in the amorphous polymers and non‐accessible for gas adsorption. Polymers have inherent luminescent properties due to triphenylamine groups and chirality derived from (R,R)‐conformation of the cyclohexane skeleton. In presence of picric acid (PA), the polymer fluorescence in solid state or suspension is strongly quenched, thus the polymers can work as efficient fluorescent probes toward nitrophenolic compounds."
16,10.1038/s41598-018-22507-2,"In this paper, we proposed a new strategy to prepare multiple heteroatom doped (N, P-doped) porous carbon materials with high surface area of ~1,535 m2 g−1 simply by pyrolysis of imine-linked porous organic polymers (POPs) synthesized via Schiff base condensation. The strategy is simple without any post-processing and various heteroatoms could be involved. Scanning electron microscopy, Raman spectra, Nitrogen gas adsorption-desorption, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy have been used to characterize the morphology, the structure and the composition of the materials. The multiple heteroatom doped porous carbon materials also display high electrocatalytic performance as exampled by the application in oxygen reduction, which showed the catalyst favors 4-electron transfer during the process, along with superior stability and higher tolerance to methanol as compared to the Pt/C. These results indicate the present method is promising for the preparation of multi-heteroatom doped carbon materials in the application of electrocatalysis."
17,10.1021/jacs.5b12797,"High-purity semiconducting single-walled carbon nanotubes (s-SWNTs) with little contamination are desired for high-performance electronic devices. Although conjugated polymer wrapping has been demonstrated as a powerful and scalable strategy for enriching s-SWNTs, this approach suffers from significant contaminations by polymer residues and high cost of conjugated polymers. Here, we present a simple but general approach using removable and recoverable conjugated polymers for separating s-SWNTs with little polymer contamination. A conjugated polymer with imine linkages was synthesized to demonstrate this concept. Moreover, the SWNTs used are without prepurifications and very low cost. The polymer exhibits strong dispersion for large-diameter s-SWNTs with high yield (23.7%) and high selectivity (99.7%). After s-SWNT separation, the polymer can be depolymerized into monomers and be cleanly removed under mild acidic conditions, yielding polymer-free s-SWNTs. The monomers can be almost quantitatively recovered to resynthesize polymer. This approach enables isolation of “clean” s-SWNTs and, at the same time, greatly lowers costs for SWNT separation."

Theoretical modeling of the compound and its copper complex was performed. Practical utility was explored by successful paper strip response."
